At a place already over-populated with lectures, performances and other community events, who would be interested in attending yet another optional event? Many were. The student, faculty and staff turnout that afternoon was respectable, if not large, and faculty and staff outnumbered students in most sessions. Of greater significance, both those who presented and those who attended the first conference left with the impression that they had participated in something special, urging those in charge of planning the conference to find ways to increase involvement among all constituencies of the college.

Why was the Ruhlman Conference such a success? A student on the first program committee for the conference provided insight into that question when she suggested that \xe2\x80\x9cWellesley was a very academic place, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as intellectual as it might be.\xe2\x80\x9d By that we believe she meant that Wellesley students set high academic standards for themselves and their peers, that they worked hard to achieve those standards\xe2\x80\x94but that they spent more time talking about how hard they work than about what they are working on. Although the Ruhlman Conference provided a venue to applaud and celebrate the hard work necessary to produce excellent projects, its focus was on the results of that hard work\xe2\x80\x94the knowledge, understanding and joy that comes through serious intellectual engagement. More than 15 years later, it is hard to imagine Wellesley without the Ruhlman conference. It is built into our calendar and our consciousness. Students look forward to their presentations as they plan their research projects. Faculty mark the years by remembering which students participated in a Ruhlman panel or poster session. Deans describe the conference to candidates for faculty positions as one of the great selling points of the institution. Other colleges planning student research conferences look enviously at the structure we have built. Part of the joy of the day is the way in which traditional divisions are broken down. Science talks happen in Pendleton, poetry readings in the Science Center. Panels are created that cross disciplines and make new connections; the audiences are filled with staff, faculty, and students interacting with the presenters and with one another in new ways. And part of the joy comes from Barbara Ruhlman\xe2\x80\x99s obvious delight in her creation. The gratitude that flows back and forth between her and the students adds to the special nature of the day and is a manifestation of the connections among generations of Wellesley alumnae. It is not difficult to see why the Ruhlman Conference has become such a valued Wellesley tradition. Lee Cuba is Professor of Sociology and former Dean of the College.

A higher temperature induced lighter abdominal melanic pigmentation and a lower temperature induced darker pigmentation in abdomens of milkweed bugs. The knock-down of Abdominal-B caused extra melanic pigmentation in a segment that normally lacked pigmentation and the knock-down of abdominal-A resulted in almost pigment-less abdomen.

As sessile organisms exposed to often drastically fluctuating light intensities, plants have evolved several mechanisms for maintaining the delicate balance between maximizing photosynthetic yield and minimizing photooxidative damage. The xanthophyll cycle allows plants to quickly transition from a state of high photochemical efficiency to one of cautious photoprotection upon changes in light conditions. The associated photoprotective state, known as nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), prevents photodamage by innocuously dissipating excess absorbed light energy as heat. We compared the capacity of a range of species to perform NPQ and quantified its photoprotective importance by comparing the abilities of leaves treated with dithiothreitol, a xanthophyll cycle inhibitor, and untreated leaves to recover from high light stress. Ultimately, we hope to better understand photoprotection in plants by comparing our results to data describing the importance of chloroplast movement, another prominent photoprotective strategy.

On the surface, most Koreans continue to identify with and adhere to Neo-Confucian values, which have long dominated Korean society. However, as Korea is becoming increasingly globalized, recent cultural developments contradict such deep-rooted values. This social paradox is examined through diverse literature and a survey investigating how Korean and Korean-American youths identify themselves. Furthermore, focusing on gender and language use, we argue that sexual liberalization in Korean popular culture and the extensive use of expletives among youth highlight the discontinuity between the new and traditional Korean images.

Environmental data contextualize the resulting economic, political, and cultural changes characterizing later medieval Europe; conversely, historical data concerning human activities during the early medieval may contribute a more complete account of possible climate drivers. For example, early medieval deforestation and agricultural expansion may have contributed greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere; changed the amount of light reflected by Earth\'s surface; or altered local hydrology, all drivers of climate trends. Tracing a more complex relationship between the natural and anthropogenic factors contributing to the medieval climate system from both historical and scientific perspectives invites us to explore the implications for contemporary narratives of climate change.

Novel antimicrobials employing new mechanisms are thus urgently needed to combat resistance. The heterocyclic azole drug class is proving useful in this regard. We synthesized and examined the efficacy of a crystalline series of 1-aryl-3-(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)-thioureas generated from 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole and isothiocyanates. A second line of investigation endeavors to improve synthesis methods and drug efficacy for substituted thioamides. Modifying the classical Willgerodt-Kindler reaction permits the convenient preparation of phenylbenzothioamides from substituted benzaldehydes and aromatic amines under mild conditions. With the good availability of the starting materials and the possibility of significant structural variation, these two series of compounds have proven valuable in our program of drug discovery.

Volunteering is costly, and only one volunteer is needed for all players to enjoy the full benefit of the public good. I use the tools of evolutionary game theory to explore the nature of equilibria that arise in this game. Do the players who consistently choose not to contribute tend to be evolutionarily strongest? Are volunteers typically be those who have the lowest cost of contribution? How does the size of the group effect these tendencies? The answers to these questions help us characterize the game and make predictions about the characteristics and settings that are likely to be associated with volunteerism. I then use the predictions to motivate a laboratory experiment designed to study the empirical determinants of volunteerism. How Does Mortgage Credit Affect Low-income Communities?

In contrast to temperature programmed desorption (TPD), a post-irradiation technique we have used previously, IRAS does not require thermal processing prior to product detection. Our goal is to simulate processes which occur when high-energy cosmic rays interact with interstellar ices, where methanol, a precursor of several prebiotic species, is abundant.

It was derived from the payada de contrapunto: a practice in which two singers (payadores) accompanying themselves on the guitar would improvise lyrics competitively, almost in the manner of a singing duel. From this improvised song, the milonga evolved into a syncopated dance form that would later influence the tango. The milonga has had a special relationship with the guitar, and occupies a cherished place in the heart of Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges whose milonga poems appear in his work Para las seis cuerdas.

A cluster of neural precursor cells residing in a ""neurogenic niche"" has been identified in our animal model, the crayfish Procambarus clarkii. However, because all daughter cells from the niche migrate away to their final destinations in the brain, an extrinsic source of neural precursors must exist, although its identity remains unknown. By employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we are evaluating our hypothesis that hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) serve as neural precursors in adult neurogenesis. The migration of cells is observed through the MRI tracking of superparamagnetic iron oxide particle (SPIO) labeled hemocytes from Procambarus clarkii. To increase the efficiency of visualizing cell migration, techniques to isolate a candidate neuronal precursor cell type, the semi-granular cells, are being developed.
