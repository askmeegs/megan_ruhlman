abstract
"""This study compared differences in political behavior and attitudes among over 200 Chinese-American and Euro-America n students at the University of California at Berkeley. Preliminary analyses revealed that Chinese-American students rated themselves as Jess politically active, less knowledgeable about political events in the United States, and less involved in political campus activities than Euro-American students. These differences disappeared, however, once length of residence in the United States and other social variables were controlled. In addition, Chinese-American students described their pa rents as less politically involved and as playing a less active role in transmitting political values to their children. These differences between Chinese\xc2\xad American and Euro-American students persisted after controlling for social variables other than ethnicity. The meaning of these findings for political behavior among Chinese-Americans will be discussed. The Art of Hatred: The Representation of Jewish and Irish Immigrants in Nineteenth-Century American Political Cartoons Inna Kantor '97"""
"""During much of the nineteenth century, European immigrants to the United States served as subject matter for political cartoonists and caricaturists. The generally antagonistic climate of the times gave rise to a number of caricaturists who depicted the foreigner on American soil in pejorative terms . The foreigner soon became the flag of corruption, flying high for all to see in the magazines, periodicals and newspapers of the time. Since cartoons represent collaborations between the artists' personal beliefs and those of their audience, the political cartoons of nineteenth-century  America were not seen merely as isolated examples of anti-Jewish and anti-Irish sentiments, but as representations of the prevailing disposition of Americans towards Jewish and Irish immigrants. The ridicule of immigrants in political cartoons suggests an American attempt to subdue and thus to make inferior those who, in reality, were feared .

I have focused on several critical junctures in Norwegian\xc2\xad Jewish history: the time period surrounding the adoption of the Norwegian constitution, the World War II era, and the contemporary period. I will also contrast the status of Norwegian Jews to that of American Jews, in order to illuminate the particular difficulties involved in asserting minority identity with in an ultra-homogenous society.

"For two hundred years following the Black Death (1348-1351), the plague remained a grave threat to public health. It was also the subject of numerous medical treatises. Since there was no cure for the disease, anyone who had anything to say about plague prevention or treatment was guaranteed an audience. Although theories regarding the origins of plague evolved substantially between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, treatments remained essentially unchanged. A 1576 collection of four vernacular plague ""counsels,"" written in 1362, 1456, 1480, and 1521, reflects the dichotomy between medical theory and practice where plague was concerned.

Contradictions in the Delivery of Social Services Shana Whitehead '97"""
"""Having noted the high turnover rates for social service workers in the nonprofit sector, I undertook an exploratory, qualitative study of workplace experiences among this group. I propose that because such workers place a far higher premium on interpersonal relationships than do workers in other sectors, they are more easily frustrated by the conflicts inherent in all organizations. A significant portion of social service workers' job satisfaction is tied to successful, unproblematic relationships with their clients and co-workers, whereas workers in other sectors find a greater portion of their job satisfaction in wages and upward career mobility. Contradicting Karl Marx's theory that alienation and worker autonomy are inversely related, workers in nonprofit social service agencies experience increased alienation as their autonomy increases: their product (clientele) and their means of production (co-workers) cannot be controlled ."""

This talk will include a discussion of gender as a source of empowerment for Nair women, sexual freedom in the Nair community, especially for Nair women, and the legacy of matrilineage for today's women in Kerala. Kavitha Nair will consider Milton 's depiction (in Paradise Lost) of Nair women as the symbol of sexuality in a fallen world, and will also offer evidence that Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley's views on free love were influenced by the Nair matrilineal system. Vandana Radhakrishnan will discuss the political nature of the Nair community and the matrilineal system, the role of British colonial law in changing India n conceptions of the Nair, and the culture of Nair women and its meaning for feminine, social, and political development in Kerala. Finally, she will speculate on whether Kerala 's model of development for women can be replicated in other parts of India."""

"""There is currently a growing movement for allowing victims greater participation in the criminal justice process (including, for example, their involvement at sentencing proceedings). The impetus to encourage the courts to acknowledge victims' rights began at the local level and moved on to state legislatures. The issue has also been addressed in federal legislation, and some members of Congress have proposed a Constitutional Victims' Rights Amendment. In my senior honors thesis, I consider such questions  as whether the admission  of victim impact statements in trials is fair to both defendant and victim, and whether the United States Constitution precludes the use of victim impact statements by courts in determining sentences. 1 will discuss the current status of  impact  statements, and address some of the more challenging questions facing the criminal justice system on the issue of victims'  rights.

"""Phosphate concentration is a limiting growth factor for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6308.  By using growth curves and NMR spectroscopy, the optimum concentration of phosphate in the growth medium was found to be 78 mg of K2P04 per liter of growth  medium. Polyphosphate has been found in a variety of bacteria, including the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6308. The activity of exopolyphosphatases, which hydrolyze polyphosphate to inorganic phosphate, was determined in this cyanobacterium using a colorimetric assay that measures the presence of inorganic phosphate. An elevation of the assay temperature from 30\xc2\xb0 to 37\xc2\xb0 C produced a significant increase in the enzyme activity. The enzyme activity has been found to vary during different periods and conditions of cellular growth. Enzyme activity in crude extracts of exponentially growing cells is higher than that of cells in stationary phase. The enzyme's specific activities in crude extracts of cells grown in different phosphate concentration were different. The cells grown in 78 mg of K2P04 per liter showed higher exopolyphosphatase activity than cells grown in 39 mg of K2P04 per liter. There are two compartments in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6308, periplasm and cytoplasm, which had previously been separated by using EDTA, lysozyme, sorbital and HEPES (pH = 8 ) . It was found that by changing the buffer from HEPES to PIPES (pH = 6), the periplasm was more thoroughly separated from the cytoplasm. The Effects of Lipoxygenase Inhibitors on Root Hair Development in Arabidopsis thaliana Alexa L. Bontrager '97 A DV ISOR: Kaye Peterman, Biological Sciences Root hair development is a complex phenomenon involving such processes as cell fate determination, cell differentiation, and tip growth. The lipoxygenase inhibitor phenidone results in a dose-dependent suppression of root hair development in Arabidopsis. The goal of this research is to determine the stage in the developmental pathway at which phenidone acts. Seeds were grown on vertically placed solid agar plates, and the plants were examined after four days of growth. Phenidone-treated seedlings consistently showed  shorter root and root hair lengths than did the controls. The short hair lengths suggest that phenidone inhibits tip growth in hair cells. Although it appeared initially that root hair number was also reduced in the presence of phenidone, new microscopic techniques indicated that this may not be the case. Confirmation that root hair number is not affected by phenidone would provide evidence that the inhibitor does not interfere with root hair initiation. The effect of phenidone on the position of root hair formation with respect to the underlying cortical cells will be determined. In addition, the hypothesis that phenidone inhibits tip growth will be tested directly by measuring root hair growth rates using time-lapsed microscopy.

Resources must be utilized for the production of pollinator -attraction characteristics (e.g., large, showy petals), as well as for reproduction activities (e.g. , maturation of seeds and fruits) . One strategy for maximizing fitness could involve a shift in relative allocation of resources from pollinator-attraction (for early flowers) to reproduction (for later flowers) , over the blooming season of an individual plant.

The resources used to produce petal tissue and to maintain the flower on the pedicle (longevity) represent energy that could alternatively be used to develop more ovaries and nourish increased numbers of seeds.

The purpose of the present study was to deter\xc2\xad mine what effects female hormones have on spatial memory in the Flag-APP -ClOO mouse. Female transgenics, approximately six-months in age, were first ovariectomized to decrease their circulating hormone levels. Four weeks later, their memory was tested using a passive-avoidance paradigm and swim maze navigation tasks (including spatial, spatial reversal, and cued versions) to determine if the altered hormone levels affected the severity of their memory deficit. Four groups of mice were included in the study: intact, transgene-negative; ovariectomized, transgene-negative; intact, transgene-positive; and ovariectomized, transgene-positive. Results show that ovariectomized animals perform more poorly than intact animals and transgene positive animals perform more poorly than transgene-negative animals in the spatial task.

The Reflection of Gender Stereotypes in Children\'s Human Figure Drawings with Stereotypically Male-Appropriate and Female-Appropriate Toys Marivic Dizon \'98 and Gwen Stead \'98 This study examined whether preschool childrens\' human figure drawings (HFDs) could be used experimentally to measure childrens\' adherence to gender stereotypes about toys. Nineteen preschool children were told a story about a same-sex character and asked to draw the character with a stereotypically male-appropriate (truck) or female-appropriate (doll) toy. Children could choose from four stereotypically male and four stereotypically female colors with which to draw. They were then asked to rate the amount of fun the story character was having in their two drawings. Results indicated that girls reported their figures having ""a lot "" of fun with the doll significantly more than boys did. Girls used significantly more female colors in their drawings, and boys used more male colors. Analyses showed that neither the time children spent drawing, the size and detail of their HFDs, nor the distance their figures were placed from the toys revealed significant differences due to gender stereotypes . The Relationship Between Empathy and Birth Order Rebecca Kropf \'97, Kathryn Hughes \'97, Melissa DiPetrillo \'97, Presented by Rebecca Kropf There is conflicting evidence regarding the role of birth order in childrens\' empathic responses. In this study we examined the relationship between empathy and birth order in 27 preschool children between three and five years of age. Empathy was evaluated through verbal responses and facial expressions to four fictional stories. Each story was designed to elicit one of four emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, or fear. In addition to birth order differences, age and sex differences were also examined in'"

"Polymer gels have been developed that can detect and identify metal ions in solution. These gels undergo a phase transition when they reach critical temperature. When a charged gel is exposed to metal ions, the critical temperature of the gel changes. With an understanding of how gel transition temperature is related to metal ion presence, it should be possible to identify ions in solution using a gel sensor. Such a sensor, called a chromatograph, will undergo a change in critical temperature upon expo\xc2\xad sure to ions. As the ions diffuse through the gel, the resulting ionic distribution will be reflected in a distribution of transition temperatures across the chromatograph. A monitor will measure the transition temperature profile of different parts of the gel as a function of time. This profile will be compared to a theoretical model of ionic effect on critical temperature and the ions in solution will be identified.'"
"""Multiple roles in adult men and women have been found to correlate with higher levels of well-being and lower levels of psychological distress. This study applies the theory of multiple roles to traditionally-aged college women and will assess the ten roles of student, daughter, friend, partner, worker, sister, extracurricular member, athlete, volunteer, and roommate in 100 students from an all-women's college. The relation\xc2\xad ships between mental health (in terms of psychological distress and general well\xc2\xad being) and role occupancy, role quality, and the level of involvement in each role will be examined. Role quality is hypothesized as being most predictive of both measures of mental health. Moreover, the relationship between role quality and one's reported mental health is believed to be influenced both by the level of perceived social support and by one's employed coping strategy in managing multiple domains in life. Exploratory issues, such as the relationships between roles and which role is most predictive of better mental health, will also be investigated.

"The purpose of this study was to determine whether friends working together would produce a more creative product than acquaintances . Three- to five-year-old children were paired either with a friend or an acquaintance to perform a collage\xc2\xad making task. The children were videotaped, and task, verbal, and non-verbal behaviors were coded and rated. Results indicated that friends produced a more creative collage than acquaintances, though this difference only approached significance. Additionally, among five-year-olds, friends smiled and/or laughed more and worked longer on the task than did acquaintances. Sex differences arose, indicating that girls created more technically good and likable products. Girls smiled significantly more than boys and were rated as more playful.

"Maria Edgeworth is often regarded as a political writer, and has been cited variously by critics as both a cause and an opponent of the Irish Union with Great Britain in 1800. The irony in this assessment of Castle Rackrent, Ennui, and The Absentee, her ""Irish Novels,"" is that through tricks of narrative, Edgeworth in fact says very little about politics. Edgeworth\'s political inclinations are formed in the space between outright colonialism and an Enlightenment respect for the individual, and she consistently appeals for only one value or virtue: education. The malleability of her writing allows it to be claimed by a variety of interests, but Edgeworth, herself, refuses to take a political ""side.""'"
"""It is extremely difficult to access where to situate Mrs. Humphry Ward's Marcella in the canon of New Women Literature. Published in 1894, Marcella is a political romance that was a blockbuster novel. The novel explores the complex relationship between self-government and personal integrity. Marcella, the future heiress of Mellor Park, must reconcile her selfish ambition for social recognition with her more altruistic goals of social philanthropy. Her public activity, her London nursing, and her social experiments suggest that she belongs to a tradition of tremendously independent female heroines. However, this reading is complicated by Marcella's eventual marriage to the Parliamentarian Aldous Raeburn and her diminution of agency at the conclusion of the novel. Marcella's problematic feminism seem reflective of Mrs. Ward's own conflicted feelings about feminism. Mrs. Ward was a vehement opponent of women's suffrage, the first female journalist on the front in World War I, and the impetus behind the establish\xc2\xadment of Somerville College the first recog\xc2\xadnized women's college at Oxford.

"""In Elizabeth Gaskell's (1810-65) Manchester\xc2\xadinspired works, a resourceful female character emerges who independently imagine and fashions potential alternatives to traditional social structures. In Manchester, Mrs. Leigh of Lizzie Leigh creates her own interpretation of God's mercy in order to reclaim her fallen daughter in a striking reaction to male authority. The city allows for a progressive sense of female independence and, in the novels Mary Barton and North and South, an unconventional access to the public realm. In the urban setting, women's private, emotional needs are set against potentially dangerous threats such as isolation and seduction. The countryside, by contrast, allows for a heavenly escape from emotional and physical urban dangers, but the escape is merely an excursion and thus transitory at best. Within the earthly reality of the city, friendships between women create a vital source of human connection and communication in Gaskell's fiction. Throughout these works, Gaskell argues for a progressive female activity that daringly counters Victorian social norms. """

Within the choices of abortion, adoption, and raising the child, there are infinite considerations and consequences. Our goal is to address the many questions a woman faces. Does she wish to have the child or terminate the pregnancy? If she carries the pregnancy to term, will she then raise the child she bears, or will she choose adoption, foster care, or some other arrangement? How does the progression of fetal development influence her choice? What role, if any, should the biological father, or others in her family and friendship groups play in her decision? What are the psychological impli\xc2\xadcations, rewards and difficulties of each choice? In addition to providing information, our hope is that this work will help women garner the strength necessary to make important decisions in reproduction.'"

The study design also led participants to make an activity choice they had not anticipated. Of the several hypotheses proposed, only a few were supported by significant results. The pattern of results, however, lead to the conclusion that students seem to differ in type of activity choice, participation patterns, and reasons for participation in relation to particular trait dimensions.

The agent informs the user when the value of a stock has risen or fallen by a certain amount or reached a certain level, and it tracks the performance of the stock over time. Considerable flexibility is provided through a user-friendly interface that allows the user to customize the behavior of the agent. After the initial input is provided, the monitoring is performed without human intervention.

"""We examined longitudinal relations between the qualities of the mother-child relationship al 9 and 14 months - specifically maternal responsiveness to child and shared interactive positivity - and the child's empathic and unempathic responses at 22 months in 106 children (53 girls, 53 boys). The qualities of the mother-child relationship were measured using multiple behavioral markers of interactions observed in lengthy naturalistic contexts. Children's empathy was assessed by observing the child's behavior in a contrived laboratory situation when the mother pretended that the child hurt her finger during play. Broadly ranging affective and behavioral reactions (direction of gaze, verbalizations, facial expressions, reparatory and comforting behaviors, overall distress, as well as aggression, ignoring mother, failing to comfort or make reparations) were coded. As expected, children in relationships characterized by higher maternal responsiveness at 9 months were more empathic to maternal distress at 22 months. Girls showed more empathic responses than boys. """
"""Two types of parental involvement, academic and emotional, were examined in Wellesley College students.

Positive parental academic involvement was correlated with higher motivation for academic work, but the relationship was not mediated by locus of control. Positive emotional interactions correlated with optimism, while negative emotional interactions correlated negatively with optimism. """
"""The study of grouping tendencies is a basic component of behavioral ecology. Usually, there are multiple causes for the formation and continuation of groups. In killer whale (Orcinus area), however, I hypothesize that there is one primary cause: social benefit. Social benefit includes increased inclusive fitness, cooperation, and learning. The killer whale is exceptional because of the characteristics which arise from social benefit: minimal intraspecific aggression, lack of territoriality, family groups with high inclusive fitness increasing group cohesion, low dispersal among groups, and promiscuous mating. To test the hypothesis, I used a cost\xc2\xadbenefit analysis, i.e., is the presence of social benefit or the absence of costs associated with predation or resource limitation most influential for killer whale populations? I used a simulation modeling approach to assess costs and benefits in terms of their effects on population growth. Alternative life-history strategies were assessed by altering the model's structure and parameter values. """
"""The influence of peers versus activity preference on activity selection was examined in children ages two to five at the Wellesley College Child Study Center. Observations of peer presence, teacher presence, and activity selection were made over a two week period. These observations were followed by individual interviews in which the children were asked to pick their top three preferred playmates and activities from a set of photographs of their peers and activity choices. Teachers were also asked to rate each child's top three preferred playmates and activities. Four- and five-year-olds were observed to spend significantly more time with their preferred playmates than at a preferred activity. Four- and five-year-old girls spent more time playing in their preferred activities than did boys of the same age. Four-year-olds spent less time with their preferred playmates when a teacher was present. It is expected that two\xc2\xadyear olds will spend significantly more time at preferred activities than with preferred playmates and that there will be fewer sex differences between boys and girls about how much time they spend with preferred activities or playmates. It is expected that there will not be a significant difference between the amount of time three-year-olds spend with preferred playmates and preferred activities. Sex differences in the three-year-old classroom are unknown. """

This was also a time of political titans similar to those populating Julius Caesar. The language of the play describes people in contradictory extremes. People have been taught particular interpretations of the characters (Caesar as an evil tyrant vs. Caesar as a great populist thinker). I used two forms of propaganda to dislodge preconceptions and to immerse audience members in the political context of the play. One controversial staging choice was the brutality of Caesar's assassination. Textual clues towards a theme of powerlessness, as well as the body stabbed 33 times, justified an unusually cruel staging. """

Many ecclesiastical writings dwelt on this topic, but none in as much detail as the Irish penitentials. These handbooks, written as guides for priests hearing confession, enumerated every conceivable carnal sin, and suggested appropriate penances, providing a glimpse of early medieval attitudes towards sexual activity.

"Hermaphroditos, the son of Hermes and Aphrodite, first appears in Greek inscriptions, literature, and material culture in the fourth century B.C. The earliest references place him in a religious context, and it is not until the first century B.C. that the details of his myth survive. Possessing both male and female sexual characteristics, much of his iconography in art is drawn from Aphrodite, and representations have been found in a number of different media and archaeological contexts. While the number of Greek inscriptions and representations of Hermaphroditos are limited, during the Roman period his popularity explodes. He is the subject of a number of wall paintings from Pompeii, and even table legs onto which he is carved have been found in houses.

"One of the greatest challenges in teaching is to encourage and support student learning without diminishing intrinsic motivation. Observations collected by Professor Beth Hennessey in a fourth grade classroom were coded and analyzed. The classroom teacher supported student learning through praise and positive reinforcement, and also used a technique called modeling. Throughout the day, she highlighted examples of desirable classroom behavior to positively reinforce students and demonstrate to the rest of the class what was expected. Few studies have examined modeling techniques. Instead, research has focused on the ""hidden costs of reward."" In other words, tangible reward (including verbal praise) can often serve to decrease student motivation and hinder performance. A review of the research on intrinsic motivation and the effects of rewards reveals that modeling may be an effective technique that can be used by teachers to encourage student learning and appropriate classroom behavior without decreasing intrinsic motivation.

"Biological Sciences Zooplankton in both freshwater and marine ecosystems use light as a stimulus for their diel nocturnal migrations. The relative change in light intensity acts as the cue that initiates this daily migration. Some animals are extremely sensitive to light levels and avoid complete migration in full moonlight. It was predicted that urban light pollution would decrease the amplitude and magnitude of zooplankton vertical migration in urban lakes. Black and clear plastic, cylindrical enclosures were deployed vertically in the water column within a half hour of sunset in Lake Waban, a suburban lake near Boston. Zooplankton within the enclosures and at open lake sites were sampled at three depths. The migration of Daphnia retrocurva was significantly greater in amplitude and magnitude in the black enclosures than in the clear and lake treatments. The results supported the hypothesis that urban light pollution is sufficient to inhibit diel vertical migration of zooplankton. '"
"Biological Sciences Soil quality was studied in forest plots irrigated with wastewater from the Falmouth Sewage Treatment Plant in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The exchange acidity and base saturation of soils collected along an irrigation gradient were measured to determine the effects of wastewater irrigation on cation exchange capacity (CEC). As a simple measure of soil quality, CEC is the sum of soil exchange acidity and base saturation. In general, CEC of the soil decreased with irrigation. With increasing distance from the spray head, the pH and exchange acidity of the soil increased, while base saturation decreased. High concentrations of base cations such as NA+ and Mg2 in the wastewater caused an increase in soil base saturation close to the spray head. Protons forced off soil exchange sites complexed with N03 and leached from the system, and this loss of protons caused an elevation in the pH of soils receiving high wastewater inputs.'"

When control and heat shock gels were transferred to nitrocellu\xc2\xadlose membrane and probed with an antibody to cyanobacterial Hsp60, the protein was found to be more abundant after heat shock. Exponential phase cells were pulse labeled with a 355 protein labeling mixture at 35\xc2\xb0 C and after distinct time intervals at 45\xc2\xb0 C. Total protein expression was found to decrease drastically under heat shock. Cells exposed to the higher temperature for more than five minutes exhibited preferential expression of several distinct proteins. Proteins of approxi\xc2\xadmately 60kD, 70kD, and lOOkD reached maximum expression at 30 minutes of heat shock, while an approximately 25 kD protein peaked after 60 minutes. '"
"The specific activities of the enzyme exopolyphosphatase in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6308 cells grown in three different types of media were determined: I) normal #11 media grown for four days, 2) media with low sulfur and excess phosphate grown for four days, and 3) media with low sulfur and excess phosphate for four days and transferred to media with no phosphate for one day. The cells grown in the different media were broken in two different buffers, HEPES (50 mM, pH = 8) and PIPES (50 mM, pH = 6). PIPES buffer was found previously to keep the cytoplasmic membrane more intact for localization studies than HEPES buffer. Enzyme activity in HEPES and PIPES buffers needed to be determined before further localization studies. Exopolyphosphatase activity in HEPES buffer was greater than that in PIPES buffer for cells grown in medium 2. PIPES buffer showed enzyme activity for the cells grown in media 3, whereas the product in HEPES buffer did not give stable spectrophotometric readings. Enzyme activity for cells grown in normal media was approximately the same in HEPES and PIPES buffers. The significance of the difference in activity was determined through repetitive assays. Crude extract storage at 4\xc2\xb0 C does not prevent enzyme activity loss. '"
"Cyanobacteria produce polyphosphate when they are starved for sulfur in the presence of excess phosphate. In order to determine if other inhibition of protein synthesis would also increase the polyphosphate content of cells, the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 was grown in the presence of lincomycin, protein synthesis inhibitor that inhibits the transcription of RNA in Gram negative bacteria. Lincomycin was added to cells once they entered exponential growth. A concentration of 0.5 \xc2\xb5g/ml lincomycin caused the leveling off the growth rate. If more than 0.5 \xc2\xb5g/ml of lincomycin was added the cells lysed; any less and the cells continued exponential growth. The presence or absence of polyphosphate will be determined using NMR spectroscopy. Other inhibitors of transcription, such as actinomycin D, will also be tested for their ability to cause polyphosphate. '"
"The bacterium Escherichia coli swims by rotating a flagellar filament powered and directed by a motor at its base. This motor is a complex, precise structure consisting of many different proteins that work together to direct the rotation of the attached flagellar filament. An in vivo examination of one of these motor proteins, FliN, was performed by studying a gene fusion between green fluorescent protein (gfp) and fliN. Although this fusion was shown to be unstable in wild-type cells, it became almost completely stable when a mutation was introduced in the gene for the cytoplasmic protease lon. It was also shown that the gfp-fliN fusion complemented the motility defect of strains containing a null mutation for the fliN gene, and that the ability of these \xef\x81\xb4\xef\x80\xacfliN strains to exhibit chemotaxis was restored by introducing the gfp-fliN fusion.'"
"""A major spiritual development is occurring in today's world: Eastern and Western religious traditions, especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity, are engaging in interreligious dialogue. A primary way of approach is through the meditative path each tradition includes. The thought of three important figures in the Dialogue is discussed: Thomas Merton, Bede Griffiths and Ruben Habito. The issue of accommodating the Christian God to the non-theistic Eastern traditions is investigated, and some common ground is pointed out. The Journey of an interreligious meditator is described in terms of change and development. A new Christian contemplative community active in The Dialogue is discussed. Finally, some conclusions are drawn for the future of world religion. """
"The influence of religion on social values among Chinese- and Euro-Americans was studied by comparing Protestant, Catholic, and Agnostic college students from the University of California at Berkeley. As expected, (a) Agnostic students (irrespective of ethnicity) were less traditional and conservative in their beliefs than religious students, and (b) Catholic students embraced stronger universalist values than Protestant students. For Catholic and Agnostic students, ethnicity did not have an effect on the overall pattern of scores on measures of openness to new experience and traditionality of values. However, Protestant Chinese-American students scored significantly lower on the measure of openness than their Euro\xc2\xadAmerican counterparts. This result was attributable to stronger religious belief among Chinese-American Protestants. The relation between ethnicity and religion in shaping and expression of social values is discussed. '"
"""The protagonists in the three novels undergo hardships which spark their personal crises. As their wills are tested, the characters question life's significance. Yet Dreiser's Jennie Gerhardt, Cather's Alexandra Bergson, and Hemingway's Fredric Henry endure these seemingly daunting challenges. The novels explore the redeeming value of suffering as a catalyst for the protagonist's higher consciousness. An examination of each author's intricate and distinctive use of language illuminates their characters' reflections. In the face of immediate tragedy, the three characters gain an intensified awareness of their environments, of the meanings of love and loss, and of their individual strengths and perceptions. """
"In this study of Wellesley College students the possible relationship between religiosity and control was studied. Participants completed questionnaires assessing religiosity levels on three subscales (intrinsic, extrinsic, and quest orientations) and desire for control. In addition, participants performed a group decision-making task and then filled out a questionnaire assessing their level of perceived control and level of satisfaction with that amount of control. The results from the questionnaire were used to validate the results on the desire for control scale. Intrinsic religiosity and desire for control were found to have a curvilinear relationship. '"
"I can still hear the sound of her voice, loud over the din of crowds, traffic and other street sounds, her words dragged out in a slow, thick nasal cry, advertising the sale of chiclets and a handful of razors beside 20 de Noviembre Street in Benito Juarez Market in the heart of downtown Oaxaca. To the newcomer, the markets of Oaxaca offer a sensory feast of colors and odors and sounds. One could spend countless hours wandering through the veritable maze of fruit stands and clothing stalls in the vast, complex markets of Oaxaca. Through introductions made by my personal contacts who lived, worked or studied in the city, I met some of the women who sold in these markets. The result of those meetings and conversations is a book of portraits and interviews in which they reveal something of their work and their lives and, as I learned, some of the enormous differences in economic and social standing among them and the markets in which they worked.

"""Our presentation is based on eight surveys of Wellesley College students conducted by the members of the Sociology 301 Research Methods class. We discuss our findings in terms of our hypotheses, which were modeled after various sociological theories related to the use and experience of time. Topics and theories explored include: the relationship between a student's socio-economic status and her experience of time at Wellesley; the relationship between time management and stress; the distribution of time in activities designed to gain both cultural and social capital; Cooley's Looking Glass Self; perceptions of cyclical and longitudinal time; future orientation and career expectations; family background, immigration, and career expectations; risk taking behavior and time; and finally, how the process of choosing a college affects the use of time at college."""
"The assertion of an active Imagination, or the ability of the mind to ""half create"" meaning, is one of the most important themes in Romantic poetry. Wordsworth and Shelley use sound imagery to assert the mind\'s creative power. Sound\'s bodilessness, sourcelessness and nonsymbolic nature necessitate the use of an active Imagination to make meaning of the experience. Images of sound play an important role in many of Wordsworth\'s poems, such as ""On the Power of Sound,"" ""There Was a Boy,"" and such lyrics to birds as ""To the Cuckoo."" Shelley\'s ""Hymn to Intellectual Beauty,"" ""Alastor"" and ""To a Skylark"" use images of sound to assert the mind\'s creativity. Through an analysis of specific poems and a discussion of the characteristics of sound which make it particularly suited to assert an active Imagination, my research presents an analysis of how and why Wordsworth and Shelley chose to emphasize sound in much of their poetry.'"
"In poems such as ""Digging,"" ""Punishment,"" and ""Glanmore Sonnets,"" Seamus Heaney uses land and earth imagery to explore issues of inheritance. In part because of his own agricultural background, Heaney associates familial inheritance with concepts of land and earth. In his earliest works, he addresses the complexities of inheritance by examining the individual\'s struggle to maintain familial tradition and his concurrent desire to emancipate himself from the constraints of such traditions and develop his own interests and talents. This examination of familial inheritance leads to a broader exploration of the implications of inheritance among larger groups, particularly the Irish as a cultural and political community, and, further, an examination of literary inheritance. Heaney\'s search responds to Stephen Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 deterministic concept of history as a nightmare from which he is trying to awake; but does Heaney himself awake? '"
"""Where does identity reside and how is it undermined? Using James Fennimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans and Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon I explore the modes of identification that society uses to name its subjects and the ways in which these named subjects resist, accept or manipulate their given identity. In addressing The Last of the Mohicans, I show how Cooper's novel is in part a documentation of his investigation of the plasticity of name. I contend that he is playing with the boundaries of identity and looking for ways to isolate or control identity if and when it becomes unbound, as when the hero disguises himself as a bear, a white man is mistaken for an Indian, or when a white woman is disguised as an Indian woman. In addressing Song of Solomon, I look at how identity or a name is preserved, either through the written word or through oral tradition."""
"After distributing leaflets and painting anti-Nazi graffiti on buildings in and around Munich University between 1942 and 1943, six members of a German resistance group known as the White Rose were arrested, tried, and executed for treason. Approximately thirty others were imprisoned and persecuted for their involvement with this movement. In most works concerning resistance to the Third Reich, the members of the White Rose resistance group are presented as the ""pure and moral resistance, neither power- nor interest-oriented."" My research seeks to challenge this perception and expand historical analysis of the White Rose. This presentation will provide insight into this facet of German youth resistance to Nazi totalitarianism through an analysis of their political motives and resistance theory as evidenced in their leaflets, a well as treatment of their specific social context.

"""Though a small community of German and eastern European Jews re-established Jewish life in Germany after the Second World War, many regarded their stay in Germany as temporary and insisted that no Jews should live there after the Holocaust. They viewed German society warily and refused to plan for the future of a German Jewish community. Many Jews, however, did stay. Their children grew up in an atmosphere where their identity and existence as Jews in Germany was questioned by their parents, German society, the worldwide Jewish community and themselves. It is this generation, however, who sought to answer this question. Many responded by leaving Germany. Others decided to affect change by becoming politically active and challenging German society, the established German Jewish community and the worldwide Jewish community. They began to forge a new identity for themselves as Jews living in Germany, and their assertiveness has impacted their children's generation. """
"Why do countries apologize for past actions, and why do they choose not to? Looking at two very different examples of apologetic behavior can help us find the answer. Since 1953, Germany has expressed remorse for the Holocaust through government statements and the payment of restitution to the state of Israel and individual victims. However, Japan has been reluctant to apologize for its aggression during WWII. While some claim that cultural differences and the mentalities of the people can explain this dichotomy, l do not agree. My hypothesis is that apologies are made for international and domestic political reasons. Both West Germany and Japan wanted to reenter the international system and regain respect, but the Cold War and alliance with the United States required different actions from the Japanese and the Germans at the time. Domestic political issues in the countries also influenced apologetic behavior. '"

"For the past four decades, the Tibetan culture has been threatened with extinction since the People\'s Liberation Army of China invaded Tibet in 1950. In order to ""liberate"" the Tibetans from their theocratic form of government and incorporate the region into the Communist motherland, Tibet\'s 6,000 monasteries were destroyed, religious freedom restricted, its people tortured, raped, and imprisoned, and its natural resources exploited. Consequently, 1.2 million Tibetans have died to date. The genocide of their peaceful culture continues despite increasing support from the West. Artistic expression can be a powerful medium to bring attention to their plight.

"""This presentation is based on my documentation of an at-home mother/child dyad and the isolation that results for a woman who chooses to stay home with her newborn. Once, mothering was another link in life's social connections. Women were surrounded by extended family members and other mothers at home raising their babies. Currently, with many women returning to professional careers after giving birth, the result is a lack of support systems for those choosing to stay home. Last July, my friend Abby had her first child, Jonah, at 35 years of age. She left behind her established social and business networks to be home with her son. Her sudden sense of being cut off from familiar connections reminded me of my own experience fifteen years earlier when I'd stayed home to care for my newborn son. Though the circumstances were a bit different, (I was 20 years old and had left extended family and college), the feelings of isolation were similar. Over a three month period, I photographed Abby and Jonah on a weekly basis. This body of work is a combination of the visual documentation and the narrative text transcribed from a taped conversation with Abby. """
"Each year thousands of women in the migrant city of El Alto haul stones, build cobblestone streets and dig sewage lines in exchange for food donated by the U.S. Agency for International Development. In a city characterized by cultural hybridity and economic instability, the food-for-work programs have become a site for the contestation of political power and identity (on both the local and global level). The food\xc2\xadfor-work programs are part of the neoliberal development model and the advancement of U.S. hegemony in Bolivia. The programs are then refashioned within the local cultural and political context of El Alto. The women workers, in turn, negotiate the political and economic structure of the food-for-work programs in order to advance their own individual and family position. '"
"As it has become more socially acceptable and economically necessary for mother of young children to work outside the home, more women consider the decision between staying home to care for their children and working in the labor force. Choosing the latter necessarily means finding alternative care for their children, which may present a significant barrier to employment. This presentation uses state-level data between 1986 and 1996 to investigate the relationship between child care policies and the labor supply behavior of mothers with young children. '"
"Economic theory proposes that working hours are determined by wages. Yet many other variables such as age, education, and experience influence our decision to work. Women, in particular, are influenced by family and social factors. The number of children, ages of these children, marital status and spousal income will likely change the number of hours she commits to the workplace. Regression analysis allows economists to study how each of these individual variables will change women\'s weekly labor hours. The software program, RATS (Regression Analysis Time Series), allows the researcher to study sub-groups. Thus certain types of women could be compared to each other: ""married, college\xc2\xadeducated women"" or ""unmarried, educated women with children"" and other conceivable sub-groups. For example, we find that single women will increase their hours more than married women if they obtain a college degree. '"
"This presentation examines the change in the ideal body image of women and men in fashion magazines, as represented in the chest-to-waist and waist-to-hip ratios of male and female models in fashion magazines during 1980-1995. Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia have been increasing over the last several decades, and it is thought that socio-cultural factors are responsible for this pattern. I hypothesized that the chest-to-waist ratios of men and women would begin to decrease while their waist-to-hip ratios would begin to increase. This would demonstrate a trend toward a ""tubular"" and androgynous body shape. My hypothesis was confirmed, and I suggest that this ideal body image is a difficult and unrealistic body type to achieve. These results support the conclusion that the media, especially fashion advertisements, are correlated with the increase in eating disorders for both men and women. '"
"""Core body temperature (CBT) is a summation of two rhythms that alter a set-point in the hypothalamus of the brain. Cutaneous blood flow adjusts the CBT to its new 'set\xc2\xadpoint' by heat gain or loss. We investigated the changes of this blood flow over 24-hour (circadian rhythm) and 28-day menstrual periods (monthly rhythm). We found that there was an increase in skin temperature, i.e. blood flow, in the hands (distal) and a decrease in heart rate at night compared to daytime, suggesting a decreased sympathetic tone. However, skin temperature in the torso (proximal) decreased, suggesting there may be competing controls on skin blood flow in the proximal versus distal areas. We hypothesize that the hormone, melatonin, released nocturnally, may act directly on proximal blood vessels to cause vasoconstriction. We are investigating whether the reproductive hormones further modify the circadian rhythms of cutaneous blood flow during the menstrual cycle."""
"The main purpose of this study is to compare South Asian women (e.g., Indian, Pakistani, Bengali, etc.) at varying levels of acculturation on body image variables and factors such as parental expectations, perfectionism, religiosity, and self perception that can influence body image. Very few research studies have focused on South Asian women in the U.S. in general and there appear to be no published studies that address body image in particular. It is important to study South Asian women as an individual group because research conducted on East Asian populations (e.g., Chinese, Japanese) has found results unique to each culture. It will be interesting to see whether within the South Asian population there are correlations between higher or lower acculturation and body proportion dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, height and body weight satisfaction, bulimic behaviors, concern over mistakes, personal standards, perfectionism, and internalization of societal norms.'"
"Attachment theory identifies the quality of parent-child interactions as a critical determinant of healthy emotional development. Similarly, social interaction theory of autobiographical memory formation places parent\xc2\xadchild co-construction of narratives as central. While attachment theory has been looked at extensively with respect to infant\xc2\xadparent separation, as well as adult parental and romantic roles, little has been done relating attachment status and the construc\xc2\xadtion of autobiographical memory. A questionnaire has been administered to 100 Wellesley College students, assessing both attachment status and memory for early childhood events. Participants will be placed in one of four adult attachment categories (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, or fearful), and analyses will determine whether adult attachment status is predictive of the affec\xc2\xadtive content of early childhood memories, age at the time of the remembered experi\xc2\xadences, and whether the experiences were talked about with a parent at the time.

"We used a commonly tested strain of laboratory mice. C57BL/6Nia, for our study of normative aging effects on different types of memory. In this study, mice of three ages, young (4 months), middle (17 months), and aged (25-26 months) were run through a behavioral battery. Mice performed spatial, spatial reversal, and cued navigation tasks in the Morris water maze to examine non\xc2\xadspatial and spatial reference memory, and were run in an odor discrimination task to test non-spatial reference and working memory. Basic reflexes, anxiety in a plus maze, and locomotor activity were also measured. The results show that aged mice are impaired relative to young mice in both non-spatial and spatial reference memory in the absence of differences in reflexes and anxiety. Generally, middle-aged mice performed intermediately between the young and aged mice. Neurochemical assays are currently being performed to see if these behavioral deficits can be linked to age\xc2\xadrelated alterations in acetylcholine levels. '"
"Performance on many tasks can be influenced by prior experiences even if one is not deliberately recalling those experiences. This form of unconscious memory for prior events or experiences is referred to as implicit memory or priming. Amnesic patients demonstrate normal priming even though they cannot explicitly or deliberately remember recent events. One theory that attempts to explain this pattern of spared and impaired memory performance predicts that amnesic patients should not show priming for novel word associations. Experiments designed to test this prediction, however, have yielded mixed results. The present study tests the following hypotheses: 1) Tasks in which amnesic patients show normal associative priming tap implicit memory for novel perceptual associations; and 2) Tasks in which amnesic patients show impaired associative priming tap implicit memory for novel conceptual associations. These hypotheses are tested by examining how new-associative priming is affected by perceptual and conceptual manipulations in normal cognition.'"
"""Previously we have shown that 5,7-Dihydroxytryptomine (5,7-DHT) lesions of the basal forebrain region in neonatal mice produce long-lasting decreases in cortical and hippocampal norepinephrine and serotonin that persist into adulthood. In addition to persistent alterations in neuro\xc2\xadchemicals, the lesions produce long-lasting alterations in the animal's behavior. In adulthood, lesioned mice perform a simple delayed non-match to sample (D MS) odor discrimination task faster and more accurately than control mice. Using this task with lesioned and control mice, we could not determine whether the improved performance of D MS was related to alterations in working memory or attention. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we modified the simple DNMS task by adding multiple presentation trials. Control mice are able to learn these tasks; we are now testing 5,7-DHT lesioned mice on the revised protocol to more accurately assess lesion\xc2\xadinduced alterations in performance. """

"""The Gold Butte block is located in the southeastern corner of Nevada. It is included in the Basin and Range Province near its border with the western part of the Colorado Plateau. The Basin and Range Province is an area where the crust has been massively extended, or pulled apart. Previous geologists have interpreted the Gold Butte block as a crustal section rotated to the surface. The MIT Field Geology class, 12:144/155, traveled to Gold Butte to do geologic mapping of the area, from January 5 through January 29, 1998. Because the detachment fault - along with the block that would have been rotated - runs between the basement and overlying strata, the tipped crustal section model seems unlikely.

Through isotopic analysis of zircons extracted from the gabbro, 1 will determine a precise age for the sills.

The Fellowship School Programme, conceived in 1993 at the Balochistan Education Foundation, establishes and funds community-run, primary schools for girls in urban slum areas of Karachi. Program coordinators expected to encounter staunch opposition to female education and adopted an aggressive approach in soliciting community support. Over 70 percent of the participating communities, however, showed immediate support for the program. While the status of women in Pakistan remains substandard and awareness of gender restrictions is crucial to program success, community school promoters found themselves re-evaluating personal opinions and organizational policy on gender norms as often as they asked communities to re-examine their own ideas.

My results describe the attempts of residents of a changing city to describe their spiritual and scientific idea of ""pollution"" and express their faith in foreign technology. l conclude that risk perception is subjectively influenced by traditional ideas (e.g. about pollution and ""West is best""), that a ""feminine"" image of the river is strongly linked to the reality of pollution, that the decision-making processes are currently selectively participatory, and that the transplanting of technology from developed to developing nations is problematic.

"The explanation for the large migratory flows from Algeria to France and from Mexico to the United States lies in the unique mix of sociological push factors and the multifaceted historical relationship between the countries of emigration and those of immigration. Sociological push factors (i.e., conditions in the countries of emigration that predispose inhabitants toward migration) can, for both Algeria and Mexico, be placed in one of three broad categories: political, economic, and demographic. The circumstances denoted by these broad categories, when coupled with historical programs of labor recruitment between the countries of emigration and those of immigration, offer a compelling reason as to why migration from Algeria to France and from Mexico to the United States exists. Comparing the sociological push factors at work in both Algeria and Mexico against the backdrop of the pull factor of historical relationships with the perspective host countries explains migratory flows between Algeria and France and Mexico and the United States, as well as presaging for the future.'"
"Carl Djerassi, Andrea Barrett, and Alan Lightman are three contemporary authors who incorporate ""real science,"" not science fiction or fantasy, into their works of literary fiction. Because these authors are contemporary, they provide a current look at the ways in which science is being dramatized in literature. They use scientific issues, scientific concepts, science history, and scientists themselves as the material of their fictions. The intersection of science and literature is seen in their writing on the levels of both plot and language. The work of each writer is inflected by their different scientific disciplines: chemistry, physics, and biology. The motives of these writers range from the instructive to the purely literary. Because of their dual expertise in science and in fiction writing, these authors, and the reactions of the literary and scientific worlds to these text , provide an opportunity to reflect upon C. P. Snow\'s classic essay ""The Two Cultures."" '"
"""Sharing one's story is a common form of expression in women's experience and literature. Juletane by Myriam Warner\xc2\xadVieyra and So Long a Letter by Mariama Ba both relate stories, set in Senegal, of women who use writing as a tool to examine a faltered marriage and its ramifications in their lives. For Juletane, in the novel of the same name, her journal records her inability to escape eventual madness. In contrast, Ramatoulaye, in So Long a Letter, uses her journal-letter as a way to assign meaning to her experience as well as to chronicle her movement out of an unhappy situation. I propose to examine the two women's use of writing as a commentary upon their experiences: How do the intended readers influence the context of the writing? What is the journal's effect on the actual reader? And in what ways do the journals serve as a literary mirror? """
"Although perhaps the most celebrated American composer of the 1920s, George Gershwin occupied an ambiguous position in the music world. His fame and talent as an entertainer were undisputed; his integrity and ability as an artist were frequently questioned by the musical establishment. Tension between his seemingly contradictory styles is evident in his Concerto in F (1925), which takes elements from the New York musical vernacular and presents them in the form of a classical piano concerto. In Portrait of George Gershwin, painted by his close friend, the Mexican artist David Alfaro Siqueiros, Gershwin is represented performing this concerto in a space evoking the music he plays. Comparing the painting and the score, I consider how references to music and ""genius"" begin to emerge in Siqueiros\'s work, suggesting a relationship between composition in painting and orchestral arrangements, and between music and art in general.

"Much of F. Scott Fitzgerald\'s fiction is termed ""cinematic"" because it employs imagery, dialogue, and the effect of camera techniques, creating a memorably audio-visual experience. He builds upon this theme by introducing characters who are associated with the film industry. The Great Gatsby takes this fascination with cinema one step further by posing Jay Gatsby as a movie producer. When he returns from war to find his love married to another, Jay Gatsby puts his efforts and newly acquired fortunes into getting her back. Gatsby\'s efforts at impressing Daisy include all of the aspects of producing a movie: he writes the story and dialogue, constructs sets with meticulous detail, and creates and steps into the role of the leading man. His romance story fails to reach its happy ending, however, because he refuses to step out of his movie world and into reality. '"
"Unlike other languages, Japanese vowels /i/ and /u/ demonstrate a unique phenomenon where the vowels become devoiced vowels when found between voiceless stops (/k/ and /ti) and (/sh/). For example, the first /i/ in the word \'kikai\' meaning ""machine"" becomes devoiced when found between two voiceless stops. Adult learners of a second language often display difficulty in perceiving or discriminating non-native speech sounds. Therefore, native speakers of Japanese language can produce and discriminate the different devoiced vowels, whereas listeners not familiar to Japanese may perceive the two devoiced vowels as identical.

"Diglossia was first introduced by the linguist Charles H. Ferguson in 1959 as a term that describes linguistic situations in which two or more varieties of a language are used for separate purposes within a linguistic community. The High variety is generally used for prestigious purposes such as education and government while the Low variety is used for everyday conversation. As originally proposed by Ferguson, the application of the term carries specific requirements. However, linguists such as Joshua Fishman and James Tollefson have recently introduced a broader set of criteria which recognizes the wide range of variability across situations with diglossic qualities. This poster session examines the relevance of the term diglossia in two linguistic communities: among bilingual speakers of Spanish and English in Puerto Rico in the 1920s and 1930s and among bidialectal speakers of Black American English and Standard American English in the United States today.'"
"""Self-determination in Tibet has become a widely debated subject. Following the military deployment of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1959, the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of the Tibetan people, was exiled to Dharmsala, India. The fourteenth Dalai Lama is different from all of his predecessors. He holds symbolic significance as the keeper of Tibetan culture and religion. Even though the average person does not know much about Tibetan history, they respect the Dalai Lama and want to help his cause. This presentation will summarize the accomplishments of this unique figure and introduce the Tibetan society he left behind. """
"""In 1910, Japan annexed Korea as part of its growing empire, and the Korean people were forced to undergo an aggressive process of assimilation. The colonialists sought to erase Korea's indigenous culture and attempted to replace it with a transplant of Japanese social structure and beliefs. Despite their legal status as Japanese citizens, ethnic Koreans found themselves to be an isolated minority group, excluded from any meaningful participation in Japanese society. The insolubility of Koreans was due to the very ideology that served as the motivation and justification for Japan's imperialism. Under the Family State (kazoku kokka) system, the state exceeded a mere political entity and instead came to be identified as an extended family unit, inextricably linked by a common bloodline. It was this blood that distinguished the Yamato people of Japan from all the others. In a societal construct that equated racial uniformity with superiority and membership, integration proved illusive for Japan's Korean minority. """
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a protracted social conflict that is perceived as intercommunal in nature since the end of the Cold War. Methods of conflict resolution have not fully acknowledged the need for asymmetry of power between the two communities or a system that addresses the differing cultures of the two groups. This presentation will address the need to develop new methods of conflict resolution in light of the realization that the conflict is intercommunal and the possibilities for new methods that can be developed.

"In my photographic comparison of two communities, I am examining what lies at the center of communities: what are they formed around and what keeps them together? The two communities I have chosen, one in Chicago centered around the historic Pullman manufacturing plant and one in Cambridge, Massachusetts centered around a historic Baptist church, are both made up of a diverse grouping of people who view their communities in very different way. And although the people who make up these societies are so varied, there still exists a strong total of experience, which I believe is due to the physical and ideological bases that both of the communities have. I explored these places with my camera, both photographing and talking to people. I got very varied responses from all of the people I talked to, but I learned a lot about people and the places they call home. Those are the things I want to show in this project. '"

"""This thesis, written in the form of a novel, follows the adventures of Pepper, a young man who is convinced that he has obliterated his identity. Pepper, a misogynistic genius, provokes questions about immorality vs. amorality, the definition and endurance of self, solipsism vs. evil, and insanity. Pepper's narration is at once convoluted and poetic, often challenging the reader to decide if he is a trustworthy storyteller or merely a madman. The novel strives to test the boundaries of how far a reader will trust his or her narrator simply because he is the only guide provided. Ultimately, the novel leaves space for the reader to complete the story with his or her own judgment of what is true."""
"""Gender undoubtedly affects a film director's view of women. This perception, then, is translated on screen through the presentation or invalidation of female stereotypes. Furthermore, this representation of women often reflects the contemporary cultural climate. This is certainly the case for the films by Italian women directors. Four works by Francesca Archibugi, Liliana Cavani, and Lina Wertmuller all examine women's issues and voice the concerns of the developing feminist movement in Italy from the 1970's through the 1990's. The Night Porter (Cavani, 1974) metaphorically illustrates the growing self-awareness of women and their demand for equal rights. Swept Away ... (Wertmuller, 1974) and Sotto ... sotto (Wertmuller, 1984) both offer critiques of the culturally constructed sexual hierarchy, as well as of the traditional gender roles. Finally, Verso sera (Archibugi, 1990) presents the continuing discussion of a woman's place in society, specifically addressing the issue of motherhood. """
"After viewing more than a dozen of legendary director Alfred Hitchcock\'s works, l have documented several recurring narrative themes. When considered concurrently, these repeating elements construct rigid gender roles for Hitchcock\'s characters. The result is the creation of a cinematic role which can definitively be termed the Hitchcockian Male, and which is the basis for numerous criticisms from feminist film theorists of Hitchcock\'s alleged misogyny. This Hitchcockian Male is characterized through a repeating cinematic process: an initial tragic emasculation, followed by suffering due to ensuing impotence and incompetence, leading finally to redemption through the necessary submission of a formerly confident and capable female character. Using video accompaniment as visual ""proof,"" I will trace this conception of the Hitchcockian Male by examining closely a few of the more illustrious themes: impotence in Vertigo; voyeurism in Rear Window; homoeroticism in Strangers on a Train; and female sexual promiscuity in Notorious and The Birds.

"Theoretical approaches concerning the representations of Chicanas in American films have not been extensive and rarely diverge from the virgin/vamp dichotomy. Renditions of this include the ""good"" Catholic girl who unavoidably goes ""bad,"" or the illustrious image of the over-sexualized Chicana, already fully fetishized and even more ready to serve the white man. Other representations, conversely, leave the Chicana devoid of any desires. She is hard\xc2\xadworking, saintlike, usually a mother figure, whose main purpose in life is to keep the family together. Although this virgin/vamp dichotomy is rampant in most American films, and especially those produced by or in the style of Hollywood, l am mostly interested in addressing other modes in which sexuality is portrayed. After all, reading the Chicana representations in film is more intriguing and complicated than what the stringent virgin/vamp dichotomy implies.'"
"Priming is a form of implicit memory which measures the effect of prior exposure to a stimulus on subsequent identification of the stimulus following a delay. In this study, the predictions of two competing theories of perceptual priming were tested. The bias mechanism theory predicts that prior exposure to a stimulus (e.g., a butterfly) will facilitate subsequent identification of the stimulus. However, the bias mechanism theory also predicts that prior exposure to a stimulus (e.g., a butterfly) will hinder subsequent identification of a different, but perceptually similar stimulus (e.g., a bow tie). In contrast, the perceptual representation system theory predicts that prior exposure to a stimulus will only facilitate subsequent identification of that stimulus and will have no effect on subsequent identification of perceptually similar stimuli. The present study examines the conditions under which identification of pictures is enhanced or hindered by recent exposure to identical, similar, or dissimilar pictures. '"
"Life is a series of change, of letting go of old ways of being that do not work anymore. Those old ways of being are connected with memories, people, and idealism that is lost. Yet, these things make up our past, and the past is the place from which each of us lifts our foot and puts it down in the present. It is the thing that draws people of like experi\xc2\xadences together and shelters them against isolation. Though we are constantly moving away from our past, we carry it with us and draw from it to make sense of our present. To hold these things, we name them, show them in art, and tell them in stories. Through sculpture and memoir I have recorded my past, considering both how it has shaped who I am and the difficulty of integrating who I have been with who I am becoming. '"
"Memory is activated and enacted in negotiation with objects, such as photographic representation and memorabilia. I am interested in how personal memory and national fantasy about the past intersect to produce differences organized around class, race, and sexuality. I use personal narrative and questions around the narrative to explore the above issues. These questions include: What are repositories of memory? How are personal objects that embody memory, like photographs, albums, family stories, and our very bodies, continuous with ""nationally"" sanctioned objects that carry national history or memory, like newspaper stories, statues, commemorative sites, and museum exhibits? Presenting with Robin Combs, I will read from a work which is interdisciplinary, based in memoir and drawing on historical studies on memory, political questions and engagements around nationalism and commemoration, and anthropological literature on autoethnography.

"We investigated the process of tuning a piano using basic principles of physics as well as computer Fourier analysis of sounds from pianos, tuning forks, and electronically-generated tones. The piano is a complex instrument composed of many strings stretched to different tensions. The frequencies of vibrations of the strings can be changed by varying the tensions. Tuning a piano involves adjusting the frequencies considering factors of both absolute and relative pitch, where pitch is related to the perceived frequency. Relative frequencies can be determined by observing ""beats"" or differences between played notes. We consulted with an expert piano tuner who illustrated the use of beats in tuning a piano. Setting the proper relationship among the notes in a scale, or temperament, involves a compromise from ideal mathematical relationships made necessary by the physical properties of the strings as well as human perception.'"
"""Basketball coaches claim that the ideal bounce pass is one with backspin that bounces two-thirds of the distance to the target. The purpose of this project was to test the validity of this claim. We analyzed the translational and rotational motions of bounces with initial backspin, topspin, and no spin, using Newton's second law of motion, energy concepts, and rotational dynamics. We made measurements by videotaping the trajectory of the ball before and after the bounce. We analyzed the video frame by frame to determine the position and orientation of the ball as functions of time. We found that a bounce pass delivered with backspin does indeed leave the floor at a greater angle than it initially hit and results in the lowest final speed of the ball. The angles and speeds of the bounces were in agreement with the force and energy analysis of the motion. """
"We observed the effect on corn seedlings of growing on a platform in uniform circular motion. The objective was to measure the effect of this accelerating reference frame on their geotropism: the tendency of the plants to orient themselves along the force of gravity. Corn seedlings were grown on a constantly rotating turntable for seven days. We observed that the corn stems were inclined towards the center of the turntable with the plants at greater distances from the center of the circle at greater angles of inclination than those at lesser distances. This dependence is what one would expect based on the hypothesis that the plants respond to the effective gravitational force they experience in their rotating coordinate system. This effective force acts at an angle which increases with increasing radial acceleration, and the radial acceleration increases with distance from the center of rotation.'"
"The International Trade Commission (""ITC"") determined, according to the Tariff Act of 1930, that the U.S. coumarin industry was materially injured by imports from the People\'s Republic of China. The Department of Commerce (""Department"") affirmed that coumarin was sold at less than fair value in the domestic U.S. market, and an anti\xc2\xaddumping duty was placed on imports of Chinese coumarin. In making this determination, however, both the ITC and the Department considered very selective evidence and information. The ITC determination that Chinese coumarin dumping occurred was the result of a number of pro\xc2\xadprotection biases. This makes potential benefits from freer international trade difficult to realize due to the protection of inefficient domestic industries. To assess the situation from a more objective perspective, additional causes for material injury are taken into account. '"
"""The International Trade Commission (ITC) investigation of increased Canadian imports of wheat, wheat flour, and semolina into the United States is an unusual case. The United States, the world's largest exporter of wheat, found itself being concerned with excessive imports. The party bringing a claim of material injury before the Commission was not a hurt industry, but a US government department whose programs protect the farm industry. The effect of increased imports on these programs, which are an indirect form of protectionism, was called into question. The circumstances surround\xc2\xading the dispute are unique to the commodity: wheat is an agricultural product that is heavily protected and receives both extensive price support and export subsidies. Indeed, the case before the ITC was one of interventionism compounded: an extensive price support system led to the provision of large export subsidies, which, in turn, led to increased imports and the institution of barriers to trade. Because wheat is not allowed to respond naturally to the market forces of supply and demand, this interventionism has serious consequences on social welfare. I examine the decision of the ITC, analyze its economic effects, and suggest alternative measures. """

"""Rapid changes in healthcare from both the demand and supply sides have had impor\xc2\xadtant implications on antitrust enforcement. In recent years, consumers' demand for more effective services and the consolidation among providers/insurers have altered the competitive landscape in healthcare. Specifically, physician networks have emerged for cost-containment purpose. While some argue that risk-sharing and utilization control should bring lower costs and higher quality, antitrust concerns arise when such ventures result in the exchange of competitively sensitive information among competing physicians which enables them to coordinate outside the venture. The issue is further complicated by the argument that the provision of health services is inherently different from all other industries and should therefore receive different treatment from the enforcement agencies. This presentation will provide an analysis of the healthcare industry, antitrust enforcement in the context of healthcare, and the Court's approach in evaluating antitrust issues in the physician market.

"The classic study of Yankee City by William Lloyd Warner emphasizes the social stratification of Yankee City during the l 930s. The analysis of the social, political, and economic lifestyle of the upper-upper class is distinguished due to the remarkably different life they led than any other observed class. They distanced themselves from other classes socially and geographically, comparatively similar to the Brahmans of the caste system in India. Utilizing primarily inherited wealth, most were old-family aristocrats, belonging to the class solely due to family name. Societal features included exclusive social associations. Statistical and primary sources (interviews with residents) today reveal that through the years, the importance of ascribed status (ancestral aristocracy) in Newburyport has diminished, and has been replaced by emphasis on achieved status (economic aristocracy). Today, what was once a clear upper-upper class has dissolved into a broad spectrum of what is considered high society. '"
"The purpose of this study was to examine the lack of racial diversity within Newburyport over the past seventy years. Interviews with local residents of various races revealed evidence of subtle racism. Respondents reported that blacks were unable to afford homes in the area, were in need of better forms of public transportation, and would bring down property values. White residents of Newburyport spoke of token black community members in order to indicate a lack of racism. National studies indicate that although blacks prefer living in integrated neighborhoods, they are uncomfortable to be the first black to move in for fear of not being accepted. This study of Newburyport has shown that blacks face many difficulties when trying to become part of a largely white community, and many suburbs are likely to remain segregated until the practices of whites change.

"This paper explores the relationship between experiences of the urban poor and conditions of the late modem world. Modernity is understood as fundamentally dynamic and globally oriented. Communication and transportation technologies allow personal relationships and business to take place across vast distances around the globe. However, research indicates that in ghetto areas, the problems of extreme poverty and social dislocation are very entrenched and seem to resist change. Furthermore, residents of the inner city seem to experience a high degree of spatial isolation. While modern life is characterized by frequent communication and rapid change, residents of the inner city appear to live in a chronically isolated world. I interviewed fifteen residents of low-income communities in Boston to determine to what extent their experiences incorporate features of modernity, and to what extent certain conditions set their lives apart.

"How would you translate ""Cheez-Wiz"" into a foreign language? What would a friend overseas think you were saying if you told her she was ""pretty cool""? The challenge of translation is to find a way of using one language to convey all the nuance and meaning of another; the art lies in doing so successfully. In this presentation we will discuss our own recent translations and our methodology for dealing with such problems as determining the role of the translator, resolving cultural differences, finding equivalents for slang, colloquialisms, and idioms, and preserving the tone and style of the original text. Examples will be taken from our work: ""La Femme-Chef,"" an African legend from the Congo, translated by Catherine Cloniger; ""Chacun cherche son chat,"" a French screenplay translated by Sarah Dysken; and ""Cronica de los reyes catolicos,"" a fifteenth-century Spanish chronicle translated by Janna Wasilewski.'"
"Using various photographic techniques and presentation methods, this exhibit explores the ambiguity of the relationship between the camera and issues of privacy. How can private ideas be converted into images? Who decides what is private: the photographer, the subject, or the viewer? Can the subject have control over her/his own representation? What constitutes a private space or a private community? To explore these questions we will examine the following: hidden motives and strategy as visualized through a game of chess; confidentiality issues involving patients and their infirmities; issues of surveillance; the implications of non-verbal communication using gestures as the interpretive tool; the intimate representation of body parts; the conversion of a guarded military community into a public enterprise; and the exploration of a ""transition area"" unfolding between the public and private using a combination of photographs and book arts.

"""In 1940, Richard Wright's editors at HarperPerennial decided to omit controversial sexual and interracial scenes in his novel Native Son. The censoring diminished the human sexuality and heightened the sense of animalistic sexuality of the black male protagonist. The restoration of the edited text in 1991 reinstated the past editing of the controversial sections, and re-edited the novel with the original writings of Wright. The twice-edited text exposes the original articulation of racial and sexual tension intended by Wright, but it also bears the literary battle scars from its history of effacement. Thus, the current edition of the novel insists on being read as a palimpsest, resounding Wright's themes of suppression, constraint, and emasculation. """
"The nationalities of women travelers and their reasons for exploration are as varied as the women who set foot on the land of South America. Yet for all these women, their travel satisfied a natural urge to explore the world. In times when a woman could not freely travel unless escorted by a man or in a large group, these women had to rely on a resilient spirit and creativity to pursue their uncommon adventures. My study of women travelers has come to fruition in an anthology, entitled Magic Sites: Women Travelers to the Americas, currently in press, which I coauthored with Marjorie Agosin, Professor of Spanish. In preparing the anthology, I researched, compiled, and analyzed more than thirty journals of women who traveled from Europe and North America to South America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Included in this anthology is the travel memoir of Helen Sanborn, Wellesley College Class of 1885, who learned Spanish so that she could accompany her father to Guatemala. I wish to show that travel, for women, was an act of resistance to the traditional fetters of domesticity. '"
"""No one writes quite like Esther Seligson. She is part of a distinct genre, one of very few Jewish women writers in Mexico, among them Angelina Muniz-Huberman and Margo Glantz. Seligson does not write about politics, or oppression, or human rights; her themes include human attraction, passionate relationships, spiritual pilgrimages, and sensual knowledge. Her writings often include elements from Greek and Aztec mythology, the Jewish Kabbalah, and the Bible. Her work is especially interesting because of these elements and her ability to address both the Jewish and Mexican cultures, to include the Precolombian and the Kabbalah side by side. Seligson's writing is difficult: one must wade through a sea of metaphors and travel through space and time and read through her transparent words. Perhaps because she is so difficult, no one has come forth to translate her works into other languages. I have taken up this challenge and will be doing a Spanish to English translation of Esther Seligson's most recent publication, a collection of short stories called Hebras."""
"""President Truman's decision to recognize the State of Israel was a catalyst for the future of the Jewish people. There has been a lot of discussion on the factors and motivations that led to the recognition of Israel. It has been attributed to a number of things, such as his religious belief that Jews as the Chosen People, needed to return to their long lost ancient land and his empathy for the Holocaust survivors yearning to go to Palestine. The majority of scholars have argued that the importance of the Jewish vote for the 1948 presidential elections was the driving force behind his decision. In my opinion, there is no single determinant that led to his sponsoring Israel but a number of elements, different pieces of a puzzle. Each piece varies in importance over time but nevertheless, if one were missing, the sponsoring would not have taken place."""

A case study, namely Iran, was used to test the validity of these opinions. As the watershed event that brought the power and potential of Islamism to the world's eyes, and as the stereotypical event that American foreign policy attempts to prevent in other areas of the world, Iran is often held up as evidence of Islam's inherent antagonism towards the West and as proof of the threat that Islamism poses to the Western-led international state system. The case study attempts to refute these views and prove that policy built on these assumptions may actually create problems instead of solving them. """
"In their daily lives, the Turks remain in isolation from the rest of the world. They are isolated in two ways. First, despite the potent prevalence of world affairs in the Turkish life, Turks, most of the time, choose to resist or delay interference with these affairs. Second, the obscurity of where Turkey belongs in the eyes of people of other cultures and nations leads Turkey into further detachment from the world. If we look closely at the Turkish life, we discover that Turkey is itself a world. The country is a hybrid map of all cultures, religions, social classes; traces of many histories prevail and even the climate varies from one part to another. Unable to unravel the complexity of their world to outsiders and incorporate the greater world into that of their own, Turks remain in isolation.'"
"Many aspects of the Civil War have been analyzed by historians and economists. One area that has received very little attention is the issue of how the Union government raised the nearly two and three-quarters million men needed to fight the war and consequently what incentives were created by the unique ways in which soldiers were asked to serve. Initially, the Union army relied on volunteers, just as they had in the past. However, the volunteer market dried up after about twelve months. It was with this lack of volunteers that the Union turned to initiating a draft. The threat of a draft as well as the actual drafts created many disturbances in the economic market for soldiers. With the use of a micro-level data set of nearly 2000 Union army soldiers from Massachusetts and a data set of substitutes from Iowa, I will show how the techniques used to raise an army by the Union government had profound effects on the local economies, caused much strife within the Union army, and quite probably prolonged the war because of the time it took to rally the troops.

"""As three violinists who have been playing since early childhood, we celebrate a golden age of violin playing by performing three of the great works for violin of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Chausson's Poeme, composed in 1896, was dedicated to the great Belgian violinist Eugene Ysaye. The Sibelius Violin Concerto was written in an age when women began to break into the male-dominated world of violin performance.

Finally, we present the Prokofiev Violin Concerto No. 2, which was composed at the height of the career of the most famous violinist of the twentieth century, Jascha Heifetz. The legacy of these performers and their artistry continues today, as we and other musicians like us, honor the past by reliving its music."""
"""This study examined the effects of gender composition of groups on subjects' self\xc2\xadevaluations. Sixty-six subjects (33 male and 33 female) discussed one of two topics with a confederate whose opinion differed from their own. Audiotaped discussions were done in groups of two, in same-sex and mixed-sex pairs. At the end of each discussion, subjects were asked to rate their performance, indicating how many ideas they had contributed and the quality of their arguments. Results revealed that men gave themselves higher ratings than women. Moreover, both male and female subjects gave themselves higher ratings after interacting with a female confederate. However, independent ratings of the transcripts of the discussion revealed no effects for either the gender of the subjects or the confederate on the quality or quantity of subjects' arguments. """
"The content and implicit nature of Asian\xc2\xadAmerican female stereotypes were studied using Asian-American female participants from Wellesley College. Stereotypes about Asian-American females were collected using a free-response questionnaire. Two categories of stereotypes were used to test the implicit nature of these stereotypes (the Trendy /Dragon Lady Asian, and the Submissive/Nerdy Asian). Words flashed subliminally on a screen were presented as primes to subjects. Subjects then completed self-ratings on dimensions related to the stereotypes being primed. Subjects were expected to rate themselves higher on characteristics for which they were primed. Subjects were then asked to rate an Asian\xc2\xadAmerican female in two commercials acting either sexy and trendy or intelligent and soft-spoken. Subjects were expected to rate the actress more extremely in the commercial counter to the stereotype for which they were primed. '"
"In Judith Butler\'s Gender Trouble, gender is identified as ""never fixed, always fluid."" This allows a great possibility for alternative constructions of gender to emerge in virtual communication. The body is both absent (in the literal sense) and ""hyper-present"" in these situations, as individuals seek to reorient themselves to a world in which established methods of doing so are no longer relevant. Without the burden of societal sex/gender polarization and rigid definition, individuals are faced with the opportunity and challenge of negotiating their gender identities in internet communication. The pressure of communicating solely through text simultaneously limits and expands the ways in which the individual can form his/her identity in a social context without the burdens associated with ""real life"" interactions (e.g. visual appear\xc2\xadance, legal name, self-preservation). What happens when individuals form spaces and identities for their gendered selves in a distinctly non-gendered communications medium? Inspired by a women\'s only chat room on IRC (Internet Relay Chat), this paper hopes to shed light on these ""information age"" complexities of identity.'"

"Previous biological and neuropsychological research has shown that there is a strong relationship between schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). Vision research has shown that schizophrenia is associated with an early stage visual processing deficit implicating a disturbance in the transient channel (magnocellular pathway) of the visual system. Because of the correlation between schizophrenia and SPD, it is expected that a similar deficit would be found in persons with SPD. This study examines whether such a deficit exists by testing the integrity of the transient channel in SPD. Participants will be presented with stimuli of different spatial and temporal frequencies, and sensitivity levels for each type of stimulus will be determined. Since the transient channel mediates the processing of stimuli with low\xc2\xadspatial and high-temporal frequencies, it is expected that persons with SPD will have lower sensitivity levels for these types of stimuli than normal control participants.'"
"In the field of Number Theory exists a class of positive integers known as the primes (integers > 1, divisible only by themselves & 1). Since recorded mathematics, the primes have been a confounding and fascinating area of study in which beautiful theorems exist. We are first introduced to the primes through the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that every natural number > 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of primes. When we look at tables of primes we notice that although the number of primes is infinite, the frequency with which they occur among the natural numbers gradually diminishes, suggesting that their density tends to zero. Although computers greatly facilitate the investigation of the primes, the existing methods for computing primes are still only approximations. This unpredictable behavior makes the primes an enigmatic and compelling area of mathematics in which most conjectures remain unproved and problems unsolved. '"
"Suppose a mapmaker wants to color each state of a map of the United States so that no two bordering states are the same color, -using as few colors as possible. Remarkably, the countries of any map can be colored using at most four colors so that neighboring countries are differently colored. This result is known as the Four-Color Theorem. Mathematicians have been intrigued by this problem for over 100 years. The problem was first ""solved"" in 1879 by Alfred Kempe. Unfortunately a flaw was found in his proof 11 years later. It was not until 1976 that Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken from the University of Illinois solved the problem. We will look at a brief history of the Four\xc2\xadColor problem, discuss where Kempe went wrong, and how his proof is useful in building a basis for Appel and Haken\'s solution. '"
"The Catalan numbers are the following sequence of numbers: 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, for which no pattern is immediately obvious. However, the Catalan numbers frequently occur as the solution to seemingly unrelated problems in mathematics. After some reflection, one finds that the Catalan numbers satisfy a recurrence relation; for example, 42 = 1(14) + 1(5) + 2(2) + 5(1) + 14(1) where the numbers in parentheses are the Catalan numbers and the numbers not in parentheses are the Catalan numbers in backwards order. More generally, cn = C Cn-l + c1cn_2 + ... + Cn_1c0 where Cn is the0 nth Catalan number, starting with n = 0. I intend to describe some of the problems involving everyday objects for which the sequence is the solution and to show how these problems are related. l hope that these problems will help the audience glimpse the connection between mathematical problem solving and everyday life.'"
"Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is the nonlinear conversion of two photons of frequency to a single photon of frequency 2, which is obtained from the break in symmetry that occurs at the interface between two centrosymmetric media. Using a nanosecond Q-switched laser as the source for fundamental light (532 nm), the average molecular orientation of methylene blue molecules adsorbed onto a silica substrate is determined from measurements of the SHG from the interface at a wavelength of 266 nm. The measurement of the polarization dependence of the nonlinear SHG response should lead to the determination that the average methylene blue orientation is at an average angle of 58\xc2\xb7 between the long axis of the molecule and the surface normal. The successful optimization of the SHG laboratory set-up, which includes the design and construction of optical components for attenuating the laser and maximizing the SHG signal, will be shown. '"
"The main goal of this project is the synthesis of l-b-D-ribofuranosylimidazo-l ,5- cl,2,4-triazolo-5-one, a nucleoside analog of inosine which is designed to inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) in transformed cells. The analog, which is based on the ribavirin model, should affect cell replication by interfering with DNA synthesis, and thereby serve as an effective antitumor agent. lnosine monophosphate (IMP) serves as the substrate for IMPDH, the rate-limiting enzyme in guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. Two types of IMP dehydrogenase isoforms have been isolated in humans. Type I is constitutively expressed and is the principle isoform in normal and differentiated cells. The Type II isoform, however, emerges as the dominant species upon cellular transformation. Thus, an inosine analog should specifically inhibit DNA replication in transformed cells. '"
"""Endopeptidase (EP 24.15) has been found to hydrolyze many biologically active peptides such as neurotensin and bradykinin. We have previously reported the differential activation of EP 24.15 toward some substrates by metal ions, including Caz+ . In order to investigate the effect of metal ions on ligand structure, we have employed two dimensional 1 H-NMR techniques. Preliminary data on cFP-AAY-pAB (an inhibitor of EP 24.1 S) from Rotating Frame Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (ROESY) indicate no observable effect on conformation of the peptide by Caz+ in 020. Because of the difficulty in detecting peptide resonances in the presence of water, a pre\xc2\xadsaturation solvent suppression technique was developed. Employing this method, successful spectra of peptides in aqueous medium have been obtained. The combined use of NMR and infrared spectroscopy may produce sufficient structural information on substrates and inhibitors of EP 24.15 to determine the enzyme's requirements for effective ligand binding.

"Mycoplasma infection of cell cultures is common, resulting in a wide range of cellular changes in various cell types, including human B and T lymphocytes, macrophages, and monocytes. However, in most cases, the precise mechanisms mediating these effects on immune cells remained to be elucidated. Our laboratory has cloned the M. fermentans gene encoding IL-X, a 42-45 kD protein originally isolated from the supernatants of a human lymphoblastoid (EBV +) B cell line exhibiting increased proliferation. PCR-coupled site-directed mutagenesis was used to subclone the entire IL-X gene into pTYBl, an IMPACT T7 (Intein Mediated Purification with an Affinity Chitin-binding Tag) expression vector. This construct is currently being expressed in the presence of an opal (TGA) tRNA suppressor using the IMPACT T7 protein expression system. Biological assays investigating the effect of IL-X on lymphoblastoid and other immune cells will be undertaken once sufficient amounts of the IL-X protein are obtained.'"
"The heightened understanding of the interaction between nucleoside substrates and their catalytic enzymes has helped in the drug design on nucleoside analogs that will potentially behave as antitumor and antiviral agents. The transformation of cells causes an increase in the rate of RNA and DNA synthesis and a decrease in the selectivity of enzymes compared to those of normal cells. Nucleoside analogs are designed to target the enzymes of these transformed cells, while causing minimal toxicity to the highly selective normal cells. This decrease in the selectivity of transformed cells would potentially cause key enzymes to interact with compounds that are structurally similar to the adenosine and inosine nucleosides: their analogs. We have investigated the synthesis and ribosidation of chlorotriazole as an intermediate in generating precursors to nucleoside analogs. Elaboration of the chlorotriazole can lead to a variety of bicyclic heterocycle synthesis. Ribosidation of cholorotriazole by fusion with a protected ribose produced the expected three nucleosides, with ribose at N, being predominant. Unambiguous elucidation of the structures of these nucleosides will be discussed. '"
"""Virus-transformed cells have increased RNA synthetic capabilities as compared to normal cells. The retardation of RNA synthesis has, therefore, been a focus of anti viral chemotherapy. Since viruses require host cell nucleotides to synthesize viral DNA or RNA, adenosine and inosine are crucial nucleoside precursors to essential processes in the cell and the virus. By creating nucleoside analogs that mimic the structure of the naturally occurring nucleosides, viral replication can be decreased. As part of our work on the syntheses of adenosine and inosine nucleoside analogs, we have investigated the use of selectively N-substituted triazolinones. Phenyl analogs were used as models in order to develop the syntheses for the bicyclic heterocyclic ring systems. Phenyl triazolinone was chlorinated by reaction with phosphoryl chloride, generating a phenyl chlorotriazole intermediate. This chlorinated intermediate allowed for nucleophilic substi\xc2\xadtution at C3 by cyanide. Subsequent reduction of the nitrile then yielded the immediate precursor to both analogs.

"Lipoxygenase is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of a cis,cis-1,4-pentadiene system, creating conjugated hydroperoxydiene derivatives. Because lipoxygenase is found in high levels in stressed plant tissues and in young seedlings, it is thought that it is important in stress responses and during early development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the LOX1 gene is highly expressed in the root. Studies of LOX1 expression using a promoter/b-glucuronidase reporter gene construct are under way. Transgenic plants were created using a vacuum infiltration technique. These transgenic plants have revealed that LOX1 expression is localized to the epidermal cells of the root. Though the promoter/reporter gene system is a useful way of visualizing the expression of a gene, the reporter gene could be showing a different expression pattern than the endogenous gene. For this reason, the LOX1 gene expression is also being studied using immunostaining of thin sections of the Arabidopsis thaliana root. '"
"We have previously shown that the activity of Endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.1 S (thimet oligopeptidase, EP 24.15) is increased in the presence of calcium and manganese ions. This effect was observed only with certain substrates with bulky groups at the N- and C- termini, typified by the quenched fluores\xc2\xadcent compound 7-methoxycoumarin-4- acetyl-proleu-ala-ala-p-nitroanilide (MCA-peptide). The metals do not appear to bind to the enzyme itself, but raU1er to enhance binding of ligands. We have now extended these findings to include the activation of another substrate, MCC (7- methoxycoumarin-4-carboxyl) -peptide by calcium and manganese, and of MCA\xc2\xadpeptide by cadmium ions. The activating effect of cadmium appears to be more dependent on substrate on thiol concentrations than is the effect of the other divalent ions.

"As the European Union faces the decision to deepen the union by increasing the ties and connections between member states or widen the union by adding new members, the economic status of the regions of the European Union member states and the proposed new member states becomes a crucial piece of the debate. Greece is in a critical position regarding enlargement of the European Union as it attempts to insure future funding of its regions while encouraging increased trade with Eastern Europe. Regional issues such as agricultural funding to sustain poorer farming regions and allow them to modernize, and transportation to increase trade and commerce in depressed regions, are major aspects of the debate over widening versus deepening the European Union.'"

"""The Antigone of Jean Anouilh had a controversial premiere in Paris in 1944. Some thought Anouilh was a Fascist; others proclaimed him an Anarchist. In the English translation of 1946 this important ambiguity was lost on New York audiences, who found the play irrelevant to post-war Americans, an obvious yet uncompelling polemic against fascism. But as a reworking of Sophocles' classic, Anouilh's play is more authentic to the original when the antagonists engage in a struggle in which either could be, and is, in the right. This performance and its accompanying dramaturgical materials seek to present Creon and Antigone as both right and wrong, equally wise yet blind. At Anouilh's writing and in our own time, the reverence given to heroes is hesitant if not wholly denied. In the context of a familiar tragedy, Anouilh's Antigone makes a case for heroism, while Creon tries to dissuade her. """
"The seventeenth century lyric addresses human mortality within a context of intense religious self-scrutiny. Though differing in tone, structure, and poetic details, Donne\'s ""Death be not Proud,"" Herrick\'s ""To Death,""and Vaughan\'s ""Easter Hymn"" are alike in that each provides the means whereby its creator confronts and gains control over death through formally self-conscious schematic treatment. Donne defeats death triumphantly by attacking it with violent verbal ""strokes"" (12) and harnessing it into the rigid structure of the sonnet. Herrick attains his gentle dominion over death by ""fitting"" (10) it into his pious, melodious song; his ""feet of innocence"" (14) progress along all the steps of a traditional Christian path to insure his ultimate salvation and everlasting life. Vaughan gains supremacy over death by an act of poetic redemption; his simple devotional verses counteract the sinful, deadly lyrics of his seventeenth century predecessors, thus delivering and resurrecting poetry from its fallen, death\xc2\xadridden state. Ultimately each poet surmounts death by framing this destructive, universal power within the self-contained, microcosmic construct of the lyrical poem. '"
"Poets have always examined the divine through their work. What role, if any, does God play in our lives? More to the point for a poet, what role should higher powers play in poetry? Mid-seventeenth century poets, faced with the political turmoil of Puritan against Catholic, had no easy answers to those questions. Robert Herrick, in ""The Argument: To His Book,"" took a secular view, celebrating the pleasures of daily life and not concerning himself much with the immortal world. George Herbert wrestled with his belief that poetry bordered on sinfulness in ""Jordan I,"" trying to find a balance between his piety and his desire to write. Responding to these poets, my lyric ""Dreamings"" sought to replay the conflicts of these poems in our modern culture. I wonder if it is still possible for poets to transcend themselves by articulating their faith in poetic form.'"
"Many Western observers will be struck by the style of an Eastern Byzantine icon, as well as by the reverence shown to icons. They have a curious archaic strangeness that partly fascinates, partly repels. A similar mystical strangeness characterizes the metaphysical poetry of seventeenth-century England, particularly in the intensely emotional spirituality of devotional lyrics. I explore this cross\xc2\xadcultural connection by juxtaposing three English poems with Byzantine icons treating similar subjects: Robert Herrick\'s ""To Keep a True Lent"" and an icon of the raising of Lazarus (one of the gospel stories included in the orthodox observance of Lent); John Donne\'s ""Good Friday 1613 Riding Westward"" and a Crucifixion icon; and George Herbert\'s ""Easter"" and an icon of the harrowing of hell. Throughout, I draw parallels between the icons and the poems as tools for personal reflection and windows to spirituality.'"

"The ""promiscuous woman"" has been portrayed in popular culture by two contradictory paradigms: the liberated woman and the validation seeker. Sociosexual orientation describes an individual\'s willingness to engage in sexual relationships in the absence of psychological closeness. The present research investigates the relationships between sociosexual orientation, feminist identity, and self-esteem in college-aged women. Previous research suggested a relationship between unrestricted sociosexual orientation, a willingness to engage in relations without emotional bonding, and nontraditional female behavior, today recognized as traits related to a developed feminist identity. Findings suggest that a more restricted sociosexual orientation correlates with a less developed feminist identity and lower levels of self-esteem. Similarly, unrestricted sociosexual orientation correlates with more developed feminist identity and certain dimensions of self-esteem. '"
"""Commercial surrogacy is a rapidly growing industry in the United States, yet feminists remain divided on the issue. Some worry that prohibiting the sale of women's reproductive services will reinforce cultural stereotypes of women, particularly pregnant women, as irrational, emotionally driven, and incapable of making informed decisions about their bodies. Others contend that allowing the sale of women's reproductive services objectifies women as fetal environments. I examine the issue of commercial surrogacy from the perspective of both women's rights and children's interests. After reviewing the practice for potential, actual, and essential exploitation, I will analyze the traditional basis for the legal assignment of parental rights which fuels commercial surrogacy. I will discuss three definitions of parenthood: the genetic definition, the contractual definition, and the social definition. Of these three, I suggest the social definition is the most likely to create the emotional ties which motivate parents to act in the best interests of a particular child. """
"Recent fighting in the Balkan States springs from conflicts that have been brewing there for hundreds of years.

Results indicate that masculine sex-role orientation has a strong predictive relationship for self-esteem as well as for sexual self-esteem. Authoritative parenting style also had some predictive value for self-esteem as did parental nurturance. The correlation, however, between both self- and sexual-esteem and the masculine sex-role orientation was much stronger. These results possibly indicate that possession of socially valued traits have a stronger influence on self-esteem than family."""
"Emotional behaviors, or ""emotion-scripts,"" are consistent with culture-specific norms and values. The study of cross-cultural variations in scripts may expand our understanding of the nature and impact of interpersonal misunderstandings. For example, this study examined Korean American college women\'s perceptions of their mothers\' emotional responses across different achievement situations. The underlying premise for this study is that Korean American women have been influenced by both Asian and American values, potentially creating conflict between themselves and their more traditional Asian mothers. Using four hypothetical achievement scenarios, students rated how they thought their mothers ""would"" and ""should"" respond emotionally. Average discrepancy scores between ""would"" and ""should"" responses were computed and analyzed statistically. In addition, discrepancies were correlated with standardized measures of relationship quality and self-esteem. The implications of these findings for Korean American daughter and mother relationships will be discussed. '"
"We investigated individual differences in response to conflict in romantic relationships. Forty-four college-age women participated in the study by answering a packet of personality measures, listening to taped conversations of conflict between romantically involved individuals, and answering questions about their reactions, feelings, and predicted response to the conflict. Participants who reported a hurt response to the taped stimulus scored higher for shyness than did participants who reported a confused response. Sensing types, according to the MBTI, reported a confused response to the taped stimulus, whereas Intuitive types reported an angry response. Participants who responded angrily tended to score higher on dismissive attachment style. Participants who responded by dealing with the problem themselves scored higher on secure attachment style and lower for fearful attachment style than participants who dealt with other people.

The synthesis of the desired precursor of the model system, 3-cyano-4-phenyl- 1,2,4-triazole, involves the cyanation of 4-phenyl- 1,2,4-triazole via a lithiated triazole intermediate. Catalytic hydrogenation of 3-cyano-4-phenyl-l ,2,4-triazole results in formation of 3-arninomethyl-4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazole. Subsequent ring closure in the presence of cyanogen bromide and carbonyl diimidazole results in the formation of modified versions of the adenosine and inosine analogs, respectively. Adapting the synthesis of the model system to that of 6-amino-3-\xf4\x80\x80\xbc-D-ribofuranosylimidazo-3,4-b 1,2,4triazole and 3-b-D-ribofuranosylirnidazo3,4-bl ,2,4-triazolin-6-one, requires incorporation of the ribose entity.

"The adenosine analog of 6-amino-3-\xf4\x80\x85\xbf-ribofuranosylimidazo-3 ,4-b-triazole has the potential to inhibit viral replication through competitive inhibition of the S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase enzyme. A synthetic model for this adenosine analog, 6-amino-3-phenylimidazo-3 ,4-b-triazole, was created by the substitution of a phenyl group for the ribose substituent. The difficulty in this research was the production of the cyanated product, 3-cyano-4-phenyl-1,2,4- triazole. The cyanation of 4-phenyl-1,2,4- triazole occurs through the electrophilic addition of the cyano cation to the triazole anion. Previous research used n-butyllithium to create the triazole anion, yet this strategy led to the formation of side products. Another base, t-butyllithium, was used since it is more basic and less nucleophilic. The most efficient synthesis of the monocyanated product was achieved through the fast addition of cyanobenzotriazole to a mixture of 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazole with one equivalent of t-butyllithium in tetrahydrofuan.

"Studies on the fluidity of the Lipid domain of the mycobacterial species demonstrate a high degree of impermeability due to the quasi-crystalline structure formed by mycolic acid homologs present in the cell wall.

Lipophilicities of the synthesized compounds ranged from 8838.1 to 32,300 relative to INH. In addition, the low inhibition rate of mycobacterial growth exhibited by the isonicotinoyl hydrazone of cyclopentanone relative to its cyclohexanone counterpart was investigated through competition experiments between the two INH derivatives and L-( + )-arabinogalactan to test the hypothesis that the reduced efficacy was due to a side reaction between the cyclopentane hydrazone and a sugar molecule in the bacterial cell wall. Results indicate that the transfer of INH to L-( + )-arabinogalactan occurs in similar proportions for both analogs under the conditions of the experiment, and therefore does not explain the difference in inhibitory qualities between the two derivatives.

"A thioamide inhibitor for the enzyme EP 24.15 was synthesized. The thioamide bond was substituted at the in vivo cleavage point of a previously synthesized potent inhibitor. The goal of the thiosubstitution was to strengthen the bond so that less in vivo cleavage will occur and more intact inhibitor will reach the enzyme. In addition, a side reaction in longer thiosubstituted peptides was studied. The side reaction results when a thiopeptide is exposed to acidic environments necessary for peptide synthesis. Both a standard peptide and a truncated peptide were synthesized. The truncated peptide is a product of the cleavage. An HPLC gradient was developed to separate the two fragments.

Different acidic environments were tested to determine whether it was possible to decrease the extent of undesired reaction. '"
"""Several approaches to form a carbon-carbon bond at the C3 position on N4-substituted 1,2,4-triazole have been explored.

The next step in the synthetic pathway, cyanation of 3-bromo-4-phenyl-1,2,4- triazole will also be discussed '"
"Sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) aggregates and forms fibers as a consequence of a single point mutation in the \xf4\x80\x80\xa16 position (E\xf4\x80\x80\xa16V). We are studying the structural and chemical factors involved in this fiber formation by using a fluoromet hemoglobin derivative (FmetHbS). Kinetic progress curves show that FmetHbS polymerizes via a mechanism similar to that for deoxyHbS, and thus represents a good model system for our studies. In this study, FmetHbS is converted to the T state by the binding of the allosteric effector, inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), to a site in the central cavity of the FmetHbS tetramer. Kinetic studies of FmetHbS polymerization, however, are suggestive of a second binding site for IHP, which inhibits polymerization. Carboxymethylization of the -NH3 termini of the a chains has been performed to probe for an additional IHP binding site. The effects of IHP, phosphate, and this a chain modification on FmetHbS polymerization will be discussed. Nature as Inspiration '"
"Environmental philosophy includes a genre of writing called ""nature writing,"" in which the author closely observes the natural world or several aspects thereof and is inspired to write about his/her experiences. Nature writing encompasses works by such authors as Virginia Woolf, Henry David Thoreau, and Aldo Leopold. This project is to be a reading of three original nature writing pieces: Kat Bolstad describes a camping trip to Assateague Island; Devika Maulik explores the ways in which her observations of nature reflect her ethnic heritage; and Anna Raphael describes the curious juxtaposition of objects and living things in a cemetery, and ruminates on the microbial fate of her recently deceased uncle Vasha.

"Each year students collaborate in the Book Arts Lab to produce an original book. This year participants manipulated photocopied body parts and layered them in a windowpane format. The group created original text and printed the text by letterpress onto the photocopies using a combination of the Vandercook SP-15, the Washington, and the Chandler and Price platen presses. The books were then handbound by the class in a limited edition of twenty copies. '"
"Scars/Cicatrices is a collection of bilingual poetry and photos. Two bilingual women in distinct mediums collaborate, giving a face to the thoughts, emotions, experiences and differences that have shaped their lives. Scars/Cicatrices is a celebration of the margin; of a people with a muddled history whose blood runs in the colors of both the master and the slave. This collection seeks to encompass acute emotions that tear at the human heart through images and words. The photography and poetry were selected independently by each person and later matched to compliment one another. The final product includes a presentation of the poetry and method of the project, as well as an exhibition of the book. '"
"The development of botanical illustration brought together a delicate mix of art and science. From the earliest woodcut herbals to nineteenth century botanical periodicals, plant identification could only be as good as the image presented on paper. With the advent of printing, techniques of mass producing images challenged the printer, artist, and author to produce quality for a specific audience. Early flower admiration by wealthy amateurs is seen in folio-sized picture books, whereas field books intended for mass consumption show humbler origins. Botany did not emerge as a taxonomical science until after Linneus devised a systematic classification of plants based on external characteristics. Identification, and consequently, classification of plants became intimately linked to how well plants could be illustrated. ""Pressed Leaves,"" an exhibition of rare book illustrations in Special Collections (fourth floor of Clapp Library), follows the evolution of floral illustration from early printed book to modern text.

"Using census data from 1970, 1980, and 1990, urban racial housing segregation was studied in five metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Chicago, and St. Louis. From this, the apparent trends in segregation at the tract level were determined across three decades. Given differences in cities and politics, these trends will be examined, and special attention paid to the policy implications of the past, present, and for the future. '"
"In the 1911 United States v. American Tobacco Company decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the company was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. As a result, American Tobacco was broken up into several competing companies. Because cigarette smoking is detrimental to the health of individuals other than smokers, this antitrust action may not have been economically efficient. Using the tobacco industry and the 1911 decision as a case study, I present theoretical arguments about the welfare implications of changing market structure in the presence of negative externalities. In addition, I consider how the welfare implications may be affected by advertising and excise taxes. '"
"The end of welfare as an entitlement and the implementation of time limits will have a negative effect on welfare recipients if they are not able to find jobs and become self-sufficient. Work participation requirements are expected to move recipients into work and off welfare. In order to test this expectation, I am studying the effect of the work participation requirements under the JOBS program from 1988-1996. Using a proportional hazard model I am estimating the impact of the work participation requirements on the probability of welfare exit. '"

"In recent years, the hauntingly beautiful music of medieval visionary Hildegard of Bingen has become well known. It is striking to modern listeners and readers of her visions to discover that Hildegard was illiterate. It is even more surprising to learn that she was a migraine patient. Pathologists hypothesize that her auditory and visual visions were likely manifestations of the symptoms of migraines. Hildegard saw things differently. She experienced her visions as a gift of God, and she wrote of them in that spirit. Regardless of spiritual background, modern women can learn something from Hildegard. They can touch the lives of others by turning the emotional and physical pain that women often endure into the language of art or social activism. '"
"Struggling for acceptance in an often hostile world, members of the contemporary Pagan community have endeavored to name and define themselves, and have explored ways in which to identify with individual and communal expressions of Paganism. Pagans have appropriated a range of words to describe themselves, from tame spiritual feminist to Witch. This study draws, in part, on survey data to explore Pagan modes of self-identification. These data provide evidence of the diversity within Paganism, as Pagans seek both to create meaning and coherence in a new and evolving religious movement and to understand themselves in relationship to other organized religions. Given the relative dearth of scholarly works on Paganism, the study also includes an overview of the essential beliefs and rituals common to most Pagan religious communities. '"
"This exhibit explores the various roles of women, from subject matter to subject maker. Each project examines representation using different photographic techniques and camera formats. Through the perspective of our individual lenses, we will strive to deconstruct the popular images presented by the media, and influence the way others perceive those images. Inspired by different sources and exploring a variety of presentation styles, these projects share the common theme of women: in their own space, in surveillance, in portraiture, in different cultures, and through body parts. Furthermore, we have all photographed the same subject matter in order to bring together our different styles, points of view, and interpretation. This small group project is presented in a collective exhibit in addition to our own personal projects. '"

"These are passages from ""Baba,"" a short story about my grandfather during his terminal illness. Childhood memories of summers with my grandparents in California - times of laughter, sunshine, bare feet, and a sense of freedom - and more recent and painful memories associated with my grandfather\'s dying are interwoven throughout the story in two movements, unfolding in opposite directions through time, chronologically. This organization juxtaposes the ideas of a return to youth and the inevitable passing of life. It also symbolizes the birth there is in every death - the birth of those who are left behind as they rediscover the fragility, beauty, and intensity of living, and the rebirth of the past through memories.

"This paper is based on research in three areas: the theories of bilingual education; the history of laws governing bilingual programs in this country; and of the implementation of a wide variety of bilingual and multicultural programs across the nation. This project involved conventional library research as well as interviews and observations conducted at Massachusetts public elementary schools. The paper includes a chronology of legislation on bilingual education; different types of bilingual education programs and the different teaching philosophies, approaches, and goals behind them; the attitudes of parents, teachers, administrators, and taxpayers; federal and state funding; a discussion of stigmatization repercussions on students in bilingual programs; and a discussion of the consequences of being in or not being in a bilingual program.

"An analysis of the blue pigment from the eyes of a Yoruba Gelede mask was performed to evaluate a noncontact, nondestructive spectral technique: Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT). A portable fiber-optic spectroscopy system was used in the Davis Museum and Cultural Center to characterize the surface paint layer of the mask. Comparisons of the DRIFT spectra of the mask and standards were made to a library of blue pigments from Western European artworks obtained using other methods. The results of these studies demonstrate the applicability of DRIFT to art objects: the spectral data identified the blue pigment as synthetic Ultramarine. This result is intriguing because this is a non-native pigment rather than plant-derived indigo. The use of this vibrant pigment- found in colonial washing powders- in African art provides evidence of the ingenuity of native artists. '"
"""In spite of its ambiguous provenance, Botticelli's Mars and Venus has been influenced by both the artist's knowledge of Classical Antiquity and by the early Renaissance tradition of marriage painting. Its iconographic peculiarity, a sleeping, nude Mars watched by an alert, clothed Venus, is uniquely related to particular images of Endymion and Paris as well as to early Renaissance admonitory texts on sexual excess and marriage. Endymion, Paris, and Mars are three mythological men who are, to varying degrees, portrayed nude, reclining, and asleep before a goddess's gaze. What does it signify to early Renaissance minds to see a man, whether a Classical Endymion, early Renaissance Paris, or late-Quattrocento Mars, lie unconscious or nude before this female gaze? It is the purpose of this paper to describe, through Classical and early Renaissance visual and literary analogies with which Botticelli would have been familiar, the consequences of sexual surrender. """
"""Fin-de-si\xc3\xa8cle Europe was characterized by legitimate discussions of sex in scientific and artistic circles. Many new theories of sexuality and femininity, such as those of Sigmund Freud, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, and Otto Weininger, created overwhelming sexual and political obstacles for women who were busy fighting for voting rights and other freedoms. Artistic representations of women, often negative and violent, were laced with the general fears and misunderstandings of female sexuality and emotion. Women's sexuality had been transformed into a mysteriously intriguing entity, often grouped with hysteria and mental illness. Gustav Klimt, Vienna's most celebrated painter, created several paintings and many erotic drawings depicting lesbian sexual intimacy. A budding cultural awareness of sexuality, influenced by Freud's writing and contemporary medical journals, inspired men to paint their fears and desires on canvas, unintentionally creating a theme of contrived eroticism in art.

"""In the late 1950s, a group of Soviet artists began to test the boundaries of approved art in Soviet Russia. Initially, these artists remained largely disengaged from politics, preferring to transcend rather than confront contemporary social and political ills by exploring spiritual, folkloric landscapes. Despite the apolitical orientation of nonconformist art, the Soviet government identified it as politically tendentious and expelled deviant artists from the Artists' Unions. By the mid 1970s, these artists had fully embraced their status as dissident artists, a transition marked by their more daring and politically motivated confrontations with the Soviet authorities. This development is also reflected in the concurrent emergence of an art highly critical of Soviet political and social institutions. Unofficial artists did not rest long upon the peak of their achievement in the 1970s, as the Soviet government initiated a strategy to diffuse the political and aesthetic force of the unofficial art movement by co-opting mildly aberrant artists and encouraging the more confrontational artists to emigrate.

"""The importance of the arts in education, civic life, and the economy has often been devalued or ignored in American society. The arts, however, play a meaningful role in human communication, social and psychological development, academic performance, multicultural understanding, economic development, and scientific achievement. This is particularly true of theatre which (unlike the other arts defined by the legislation that established the NEA) can be a collaboration of music, dance, drama, architecture, creative writing, design, graphic arts, and other multimedia. Theatre integrates these forms to exploit, explore, reveal, or change the human condition. This presentation will explain how and why communities and governments are embracing the arts again; it will focus on programs that validate theatre's unique role in this renaissance. The presentation culminates in a staged reading from a performance created to give voice to inner-city testimonies of theatre's impact on urban life. """
"IL-X, a putative B-cell mitogen isolated from Mycoplasma fermentans, has been cloned in a series of wild-type and mutagenized expression constructs using ligation independent cloning (LIC) and stitch PCR. Initial heterologous expression of the wild-type constructs was performed in the presence of an opal suppressor to encourage insertion of tryptophan at the five internal TGA codons present in the IL-X gene (TGA, the universal stop codon, codes for tryptophan in mycoplasma). Initial expression attempts resulted in protein fragments of variable length, with the majority terminating prior to the first TGA codon. To investigate the cause of the premature translational stop, in-vitro expression studies using wild-type and mutagenized rIL-X constructs are being conducted in a rabbit reticulocyte system to identify variations in the expression pattern that may be due to E. coli rare codon usage, or secondary structure in the mRNA. This data will be used to optimize protein expression in preparation for testing on various hematopoetic cell lines. '"
"""Studies have revealed that when silicon forms a bond with electronegative substituents, it has a greater negative character than carbon in analogous compounds. This research is an investigation of the distribution of electron density around the central silicon atom of two di-tert-butylsilanes, namely di-tert-butylsilyl triflate and di-tert-butylsilyl trifluoroacetate. Infrared spectroscopy and Si-29 INEPT, C-13, and H-1 NMR were employed to analyze the results of the organic syntheses, and specifically the absorption of the Si-H bond in each reaction. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy also aided in identifying the organosilicon compounds. In addition, the charge and hybridization of silicon predicted by theoretical (semi-empirical) calculations, performed using Spartan 5.0, were compared to the chemical shifts and coupling constants obtained from the Si-29 NMR spectra. The experimental results and theoretical calculations together confirmed the negative character of silicon in the di-tert-butylsilanes; hyperconjugation, backbonding, and/or steric compression may account for silicon's unusual bonding behavior."""
"""In vitro ISN NMR spectroscopy was used to further characterize cyanophycin (CGP), the only known nonprotein nitrogen storage polymer in cyanobacteria, from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

The results showed that insoluble CGP is detectable by NMR spectroscopy; CGP was found to have higher solubility in 0.1 N HC1 than in 0.1 N NaOH and to have different conformations in these two solutions. It was also found that there was no NMR-detectable CGP in a cell's crude extract. """
"Organosilicon compounds are increasingly being used as analogs to carbon compounds in several fields, such as biology and medicine; therefore, studies on how these organosilicon compounds behave are important. Most elements when bonded to an electronegative group, which withdraws electron density to itself, lose electron density. This loss of electron density is shown in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum as a large increase in the chemical shift (downfield). Silicon, however, demonstrates the opposite trend: when bonded to certain electronegative groups, silicon gains electron density, which is indicated by a decrease in the chemical shift (upfield). Possible bonding mechanisms will be investigated for two particular types of organosilicon compounds: diisopropylsilyltriflates and diisopropylsilyltrifluoroacetates. Si-29 NMR, other NMR, and FT-IR (Fourier Tranformer- Infrared) techniques will be used to study the strength and nature of the bonds between silicon and its adjacent atoms. Additional confirmation of the organosilicon compounds with be provided by analysis of GC/MS (gas chromatography /mass spectroscopy) data. '"
"Delta Lactones are an integral part of many natural products of therapeutic interests. The shapes that these molecules adopt are crucial to their function as biologically useful substances.

"Calcium differentially activates endopeptidase 24.15 towards hydrolysis of synthetic substrates, including the quenchedfluorescent methoxycoumarin substrate (MCC). Kinetic studies of EP 24.15 activity in the presence and absence of CaCl2 were carried out and analyzed using several algorithms. The Km of MCC cleavage decreased in the presence of Ca2 + while the Vmax remained unaltered. These results suggest that metal ions increase the affinity of ligand binding in an ion- and substrate-specific manner. To explore the mechanism of calcium-mediated increase in ligand affinity, EP24.15 activity was assayed in the presence of Ca2 + after substrate preincubation with Ca2 +; this preincubation decreased the Km without affecting Vmax, suggesting that Ca2 + may increase hydrolysis by interacting with the ligand. Enzyme preincubation with Ca2 + followed by activity assay changed neither the Km or Vmax as analyzed by Hanes and direct linear methods, yet an increase in both Km and Vmax was observed using the Lineweaver-Burk model.

"The cost of producing industrial chemicals is directly related to the time it takes to convert reactants to products. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed as part of the reaction process. In 1993, over one trillion dollars were spent on the use, production, and development of catalysts. The rational design of catalysts demands a molecular understanding of surface reactions. In surface science experiments, gaseous reactants are deposited on highly ordered, single crystalline surfaces with well-defined atomic structure and chemical composition at ultrahigh vacuum (10-11 Torr) pressures. We have studied the reactions of formaldehyde on a Molybdenum single crystal catalyst because formaldehyde is involved in many important industrial reactions. A noteworthy finding from our research is the production of ethylene via carbon-carbon coupling. This is the first known example of a coupling reaction on Mo(110), a highly reactive surface. '"
"The orientation of laser dye molecules physically adsorbed onto quartz surfaces allows one to study not only the interactions of the molecules with the surface, but the interactions of the dye molecules with each other. Previous studies determined the orientation of a monolayer coating of methylene blue dye molecules on a quartz surface by second harmonic generation (SHG), assuming that the surface was coated with a monolayer of individual dye molecules. However, we have shown using UV-vis spectroscopy, computer modeling, and atomic force microscopy (AFM), that surfaces coated using this procedure exhibit a multilayer structure on the surface. Thus, we propose new possibilities for orientations of the dye molecules based on their aggregation. '"
"The presentation of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to John Pople and Walter Kohn for their contributions to computational chemistry illustrates the growing importance of this field. Often used to complement traditional laboratory chemistry, computational chemistry can be used to bypass difficult experiments and investigate molecules too unstable to study via experimentation. Several different computational chemistry methods, varying in efficiency and accuracy, can be employed to obtain various information such as molecular properties, transition state structure, or dynamic behavior of the system of interest. Some methods, such as ab initio, are based on quantum mechanics while other methods, such as molecular mechanics, rely on classical physics to determine the desired output. In this study the semiempirical method, a quantum mechanical method, was utilized to determine and explore the transition state structure of the Diels-Alder reaction of maleic acid anhydride (C403H2) with cyclopentadiene (CsH6).

"Often, when modeling the world around us, scientists come across functions that behave ""chaotically"" meaning they demonstrate topological transitivity, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and a dense set of periodic points. Neuroscience is an area to which chaos theory can be applied. Some researchers think that, because the brain is a complex dynamical system made of billions of subsystems (neurons), classical models which only take one neuron into account at a time, are not fully grasping the complexity of the brain. These scientists believe that the new field of chaotic, nonlinear dynamical systems could help to correctly reinterpret the current oversimplified models of the brain. This talk will provide a mathematical framework upon which one specific neuroscience experiment will be explained using the ideas of chaos theory and will be easily accessible to all students, regardless of mathematical background.

"Suppose you want to design a wallpaper pattern, using just one motif and repeating that motif infinitely many times. How many different wallpaper patterns can you make this way if you are allowed only to rotate your motif, reflect it about an axis, or translate it (""move"" the motif to another spot on your wallpaper)? While the possibilities may seem endless, in fact there are only 17 significantly different wallpaper patterns you could produce. We will analyze this problem using techniques from an area of mathematics called group theory. These techniques are the mathematical foundation for some of the well known works of artist M.C. Escher. We will use Escher\'s art work to help illustrate some of the patterns. No prior knowledge of mathematics will be assumed. '"
"Several geometric brainteasers will be presented and their solutions will be discussed. Though these problems are worded in a way that can be understood by anyone, solving them requires ingenuity and mathematical intuition. The beauty of these problems lies in their simple and seemingly obvious solutions, which nevertheless call for time-consuming deliberation. All the solutions that will be presented will involve using coloring and tiling on checkerboards. Example of a problem to be presented: A yard is divided into nun squares by footpaths (it looks like a chessboard). You want to have all squares covered by grass. If at least two neighbors of a square are fully covered, then the grass will extend into it, too; otherwise not. What is the minimum number of squares to be planted initially, so that the grass will extend to the whole yard? '"
"""We photographed dolls, exploring the subject matter as more than toys, but as memories of our own childhood, and in found dolls, as mementos of strangers. As many of the dolls are in imperfect condition, it is unclear if the dolls' disfiguration is a result of loving overuse or neglect and abuse. In working and playing with these toys, it became intriguing to see these plastic dolls as stand-ins for our own lives and players in actions that are distinctly human. Dolls are very much a part of childrens' (and especially little girls') imaginative lives and development, and act as charged symbols of societal understandings of adult life. Much in the way that children use dolls to explore implicit roles and their developing ideas, we became interested in photographing dolls as a similar sort of play - a mock of human experiences and understandings of the world. We specifically chose to align the dolls in the positions of life that both evoke common human experiences (based largely on our personal daily activities at Wellesley) and that emphasize their artifice and the fact that they are dolls and cannot be human. We were also interested in exploring different ways of looking at the same actions and events (our subject matter) by employing several camera formats. """
"Self-Portrait Construction is an examination of self in both two and three dimensions through the form of a dressing screen. However, Construction is also an examination of other; for to define self it is necessary to distinguish self from other. This differentiation and dependence of self upon others appears again in the roles of viewer and viewee created by the dressing screen. A dressing screen is a division; it is both a concrete barrier interacting with space and an abstract barrier symbolizing individual space and our continual need to conceal the body. Screens and dressing screens raise a number of other ideas and associations, too many to describe here, so it is my hope that Construction will provide the audience with an impetus for dialogue and examination of these ideas.

"""Open/Closed Mosaic is composed of six hexagonal tiles, each containing a single image: a fist, an open hand, a shut eye, an open eye, or a pair of high-heeled shoes shown in two different positions. The three image pairs forming the mosaic represent particular open/closed states. There is openness to observation and reluctance to observe eye tiles. One can embrace tactile experience or remain sheltered from it hand tiles. As for the shoes, I modeled them after Dorothy's ruby slippers in the heels-clicked and unclicked modes. Amazing things can happen by simply switching to the opposite state. Finally, the flexibility in arrangement afforded by the tiles shows that we are, at any given moment, shifting conglomerates of various open and closed possibilities. """

I will analyze motives behind the Serb genocidal campaign for destruction of the cultural/historic heritage of Bosnian Muslims and Croats. The core of my study is the town of Banja Luka (my hometown). I focus on one aspect of the Serb ""ethnic cleansing"" campaign that was implemented there, which is the attack on cultural and religious monuments of Bosnian Muslims in Banja Luka, as a way of destroying their roots and identity. I will discuss Serbian nationalists\' intentions to eliminate any indications of the Muslims\' existence in Bosnia and to recreate history and the culture of the country. '"
"From the beginning until the end of its regime, the Khmer Rouge implemented an extreme and intense Communist ideological program. Its actions resulted in a revolution, which took place with what David Chandler describes as ""extraordinary speed and intensity."" Two points of interest in the Cambodian genocide are the ideology of the Khmer Rouge and the life of its most important leader, Pol Pot. What led the regime members to be so extreme was the unique and radical nature of its ideology. The Khmer Rouge felt it was its mission to redeem the Cambodian people from their corrupt, bourgeois ways. Pol Pot had a significant role in designing the ideology of the Khmer Rouge and in directing its implementation. This presentation focuses on the redemption ideology and the deification of Pol Pot in Khmer Rouge propaganda. '"
"After the systematic killing of millions of Jews, as well as the members of certain other groups that had been targeted by Nazi Germany, many people asked, ""How could it have been allowed to happen?"" Since that time, some of us have found comfort in the belief that it could never happen again. Unfortunately, there have continued to be numerous troubling reminders of genocide\'s staying power. Since the Second World War many more people have been killed as victims of domestic massacres and genocides than by international war. Most recently, a brutal war raged in what was once Yugoslavia. Although Western nations had documented evidence that ethnic cleansing was taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we could not agree about what might be done. And, the killing continued. The Code X List project was designed to enable students to experience categorization first hand, a depersonalized process that is central to genocide. In cases of genocide individuals are selected for elimination because they meet a set of well-defined criteria for group membership. While the act of categorization can be totally benign (as it is in the case of the Code X List), it is not always innocent. Beyond the periphery of our immediate concerns, the victims of genocide are depending upon us to not look away. '"

"""Mirroring American society at large, black communities are still reluctant to fully recognize the presence of their queer constituents. How do black women at Wellesley who identify as lesbian or bisexual create support networks during their college years? How do issues of stigma and deviance merge in discussions about race and queer sexuality? Do these issues emerge at all? It shouldn't be surprising that most of us don't know the answers to these questions. After all, these discussions are most often limited to the private sphere. And for many black women, coming out at all may mean alienating themselves from many of the support systems that are usually available for their black peers who are straight. Using an anthropological approach; and drawing upon anonymous interviews and observations, this talk will examine what it means to be black and queer at Wellesley, lifting a piece of the cloak that is rarely Lifted.

"Research on the interpersonal connections of adolescents and young adults has revealed that relationships with unrelated adults, or mentors, become increasingly significant in later adolescence. However, research has also indicated that mentoring programs have limited success due to failures in the formation of functional mentoring relationships. It is therefore important to elucidate those factors that may contribute to mentor formation, mentor quality, and positive mentoring outcomes. This study examined mentor formation, perceived quality, and beneficial outcomes of possessing mentor relationships in 126 Asian and 261 Caucasian college students. Results showed no ethnic group differences in perceived importance of mentor relationships. Significantly fewer Asians versus Caucasians, however, reported having a mentor. Caucasian students also reported greater satisfaction with their mentee experience. Moreover, Asians who reported having mentors indicated positive outcomes, such as decreased loneliness. '"
"Many individuals attempt to quit smoking by enrolling in a cessation program. Unfortunately, only 23.6% of individuals who use cessation programs are successful in their quitting attempts, regardless of the type of program used. ln order to design successful cessation programs, information is needed on the psychological and physiological factors involved in the maintenance and initiation of smoking behavior. Although much research has gone into understanding the factors involved in why individuals smoke, there is a dearth of research into gender differences in smoking behavior. This is surprising because although smoking prevalence has decreased in the United States since the 1960s, rates in women have been especially hard to change since the habit has become increasing popular in this population. The purpose of this study was to design a survey that would assess which psychological factors are most important for the initiation and maintenance of smoking behavior in college-aged women. '"
"""Throughout his sonnet sequence, The House of Life, the Pre-Raphaelite poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti strives for spiritual completion. Rossetti seeks this completion through connection with something outside himself, usually his beloved. Consequently, his sonnets frequently take up the quest toward this figure, attempting to capture a full understanding of her and exploring the feelings of longing, joy, and frustration within the speaker himself. In these sonnets, Rossetti employs his keen painter's eye to create a proliferation of surfaces, including objects of art, embodied ideals, natural settings, women's bodies, and the sonnet form itself, upon which his speaker pursues his quest. Such dependence on surface rejects the tendency of the spiritual quester for introspection and abstract thought, thus proposing another method of questing and raising some significant questions: Why is surface essential for transcendence in Rossetti's poetry? And, more importantly, can surface truly succeed in providing a link to spiritual completion? """
"My Ruhlman talk will attempt to summarize some of the main lines of argument of my honors thesis, ""Writing from the Body: Gender and Genre in the Novels of Jeanette Winterson."" This thesis examines the way in which Winterson\'s fiction explores both unconventional narrative techniques, such as the incongruous blending of incommensurable genres, and unconventional gender roles and sexualities. I make the argument that, for Winterson, the destabilization of traditional narrative structures serves as a trope for the destabilization of traditional gender roles and sexualities - and vice versa. Indeed, Winterson\'s notion seems to be that in order to give voice to the kinds of sexual narratives that have heretofore been left out of English fiction - gay narratives, narratives of transgendered and intersexual characters - she must invent a new form of narrative that in its formal complexity, its rebellion against literary norms, and its polyvalent quality, mirrors the characters and experiences it aims to capture.'"

These include the association of sexuality with AIDS, thoughts on the role of the medical world in the life of the person with AIDS, the idea of accelerated aging of the body, and the author's role in remembering/ re-membering the person with AIDS. Included in this study of AIDS writing are works by Herve Guibert, Jamaica Kincaid, Amy Hoffman, and Cyrill Collard. """
"""The theatrical community at Wellesley, which is both culturally and vocationally diverse in composition, presents a retrospective of the work created in the 1998-99 season. This piece, which will be orchestrated with the assistance of director Nora Hussey and choreographer Katie Griswold, will represent the many issues, cultures, and individuals that were brought to life in the theatrical realm during this season. As in the very successful performances of the past two years, the emphasis will be on the essence of theatre, which is the relationship between audience and actor. The title stems from an unusually high incorporation of music in the theatre season this year to express women's stories. The issues and ideas confronted will encompass everything from contemporary political satire, to the ministry of Jesus Christ, to the painful struggles of an African American woman's life.

"""Disidentification with learning has been described as the absence of a relation between academic self-esteem and overall self-esteem. The present investigation focused on black and African American children, who have been singled out in previous research to be most at risk for disidentification due to their ethnicity, gender, and SES. Because this study was among the first to address disidentification in children who had yet to enter or were just entering school, it was possible to examine directly the role played by schooling in the disidentification process. A comparison of children's self-reported levels of identification with learning and their observed levels of academic motivation was carried out in an effort to address the question of whether these two variables are significantly correlated. Results indicated significant levels of disidentification with learning even in children who had had little or no school experience. In addition, boys were found to evidence significantly higher levels of disidentification than were girls. """
Many first-year college students have trouble with time management. They struggle with finishing assignments and cannot juggle their many commitments. These difficulties may stem from the fact that most college students come unprepared to meet these challenges. Time management is not often addressed by primary or secondary school curriculums. Is time even an issue in classrooms serving younger students? A review of the literature reveals that little attention has been directed at this question. Yet my own analysis of observations made in one fourth grade reveals that children often ran out of time and rarely finished all of the activities planned for the day. These students and their teacher could have greatly benefited from direct instruction in time management. I will argue that the development of effective time management skills is a crucial educational goal - one that must be addressed in teacher training programs and classrooms at all levels. '
"""Theory of mind is a person's understanding that his/her thoughts, desires, beliefs, and perceptions are different from those belonging to others. The tasks used to study these skills in children address the understanding of the distinction between appearance and reality and of false beliefs. A controversy in psychological research surrounds the origin of these skills. The literature supports the idea that while these tasks are difficult for three-year olds, the addition of active participation and the incorporation of pretense improves their performance by adding finer gradations to the measurements of these skills. This study tested three- and four-year olds' ability to perform on easier variations of the original tasks: appearance-reality with the addition of active participation (deception) and false belief with the addition of both active participation and pretense. While the pretense scenario did not bring about the expected improvement, the addition of deception did support the hypothesis for both tasks. """
"This poster presents the results of a literature review on self-mutilation. More than two million Americans engage in a self-mutilating behavior today. Self-mutilating behavior, most commonly manifested as ""cutting,"" became a public concern three years ago when Princess Diana confessed to having the disorder. Since then, much work has been done on the disorder. I will present data on the relationship between ""cutting,"" and such other factors as past sexual abuse, rape, and poor parent-adolescent communication. I will also review the history of the disorder, its causes and what contributes to its maintenance. Gender differences in manifestation of the disorder will also be addressed, along with reasons for the general failure of medical psychiatry in the past to treat the disorder. '"
"""This study examines the impact of Montessori and non-Montessori approaches to preschool education on the development of autonomy in young children. Data were collected at a traditional preschool and at a local Montessori school. Participating children were individually interviewed and their autonomy was measured as they engaged in a variety of fun tasks. Classroom teachers also rated each child on their level of autonomy, and the children's spontaneous behavior was assessed using a classroom observational coding system. The Montessori philosophy places particular emphasis on self-motivation and self-discipline and strives to help children to facilitate their own learning. It is predicted that the Montessori children will be rated as more autonomous than their non-Montessori peers in the classroom observation, the interview, and the teacher assessments. """
"""This study examined the evaluation of Caucasian and minority female leaders. Using the Social Role Theory and the Status Characteristics Theory, we sought to test whether compared with Caucasian female leaders, minority female leaders would receive lower evaluations as task leaders and higher evaluations as social leaders. Our subjects were voluntary participants from the Wellesley College campus. Our results were obtained using a 2X4 analyses of variance. Race and type of leadership style did not interact as we predicted. Our findings showed that our subjects gave positive evaluations for both leadership styles, regardless of leaders' ethnic background. The subjects indicate that female leaders need to have both task and social leadership skills to be a successful leader in the workplace. The few significant race effects showed that the subjects preferred the minority leaders to the Caucasian leaders. We believe that our subjects were overcompensating for their own prejudices by giving the minority women a more favorable rating. """
"As the employees of a suburban restaurant arrived at work on the morning of May 15, 1993, they were blindfolded, bound, and robbed. In an ordeal lasting over two hours, their lives were repeatedly threatened. Although no one was seriously hurt physically, the psychological implications of experiencing such a trauma could have a lasting impact on both the primary victims and their loved ones. Interviews of victims and a male and female loved one were conducted one month and six months following the trauma. Inventories assessing posttraumatic symptoms, personal impact of the event, mastery, social support, dissociation, emotional state, coping skills, anger, and interpersonal dependency were also administered at one month and six months to all participants. We expect to find relationships between personality characteristics, PTSD symptoms, and the consistency and cohesiveness of the trauma memory over time. '"
"Relationships between conformity, birth order, and gender were examined in a sample of 30 preschool children. Each child was asked to color a picture of balloons and a picture of fish while observing a model ""colored by a peer"" or ""from a book."" The colors each child chose to color with and their relation to sample drawing colors were used to determine level of conformity. As hypothesized, overall conformity to the book model was higher than conformity to the peer model. In addition, firstborns were more likely to conform to the book model than were laterborns. Counter to expectations, older subjects conformed more than younger subjects (especially to the book model). No birth order differences were found in conformity to the peer model, nor were there any significant gender differences in conformity to either model. '"
"""Picturing Sam is a novella about a young boy, his artwork, and the way other people interpret his behavior. The story revolves around Sam, a ten-year-old artistic little boy, who seems more comfortable communicating through his drawings than through words. While the focus of the story remains on Sam, much of the drama involves the relationships between Sam, his Uncle Evan, and his teacher Sarah. As the story develops, each of these three characters adds his or her own unique perspective and tells the story from his or her own point of view. Both Evan and Sarah are enchanted by the mystery of Sam's thoughts and the power of his artwork. Furthermore, they are concerned about his attitude towards his art since his father, Tom, applies pressure for him to quit such a silly pursuit and take up something more productive and more manly.

"""We define ourselves by the opinions of others. Through praise or criticism the foundations of a person's psyche can be built up or torn down until there is nothing but self-doubt, fear, and uncertainty. Rag Doll introduces us to Sarah, an extreme example of what could happen to a young woman if she were to listen to all of the criticism, doubts, and implications told to her. How far can someone be pushed in an atmosphere that is focused on competition and emulation? When we stumble over uncertainty in our path, it is difficult to regain enough confidence to continue walking. It is easy to forget that you have the option of being right. It is easier to assume you are wrong. """
"When did race first become a biological concept? I would argue that it was during the ""Age of Enlightenment,"" the eighteenth century, a time when science was on the rise and man was constantly questioning the world around him. In his Systema Naturae (1735), the Swedish naturalist Linnaeus was the first to include humans within a classificatory system with the rest of Creation. In the 10th edition of his (1758) he divides Homo sapiens into races. As an influential scholar and professor, Linnaeus\'s work was known and accepted throughout Europe, and his students accompanied many of the great exploratory voyages of the later half of the eighteenth century. My thesis focuses on the influence of the eighteenth-century naturalist movement, most specifically the works of Carl von Linne (Linnaeus) and Johan Friedrich Blumenbach, on Imperialism and the formation of our modern conceptions of ""the other.""

"""Darwin's theory of evolution stands at the heart of modern biology. Darwin knew that his theory had wide-reaching applications to the study of human nature. Unfortunately, he did not foresee the myriad of ways in which his theory could be misused to further the racist or sexist aims of theorists. Evolutionary explanations have often been used to promote hate and bigotry. I will explore the following questions: can we reject prejudiced misuses of evolutionary theory without discrediting Darwin's theory of natural selection? Can evolutionary theory be fair-minded? By focusing on the philosophical concept of relevant explanation I shall outline some criteria that a good explanation of human behavior must fulfill. This analysis of explanation will be used to criticize racist evolutionary explanations of IQ differences between different races. """
"""The world's nation-states face the inevitability of a global community; new ethical approaches to problem solving are needed. It is vital that nation-states be able to maintain identity, but not at the cost of successful global relations. Human rights conflicts provide an excellent venue for examining cultural conflicts, by demonstrating the way in which differing cultural perspectives can obscure the real issues behind several transnational conflicts. By introducing the concept of moral relativism, or the view that standards are grounded in social approval, and contrasting it with another extreme, cultural imperialism, an epistemological midpoint can be identified. The work of thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Jean-Paul Sartre and Edward Said will help to define this midpoint and contribute to a detailed approach to resolving cultural conflicts. """
"We are American. Biculturalism is similar to looking through a window whose two different colored panes can slide together or be viewed separately. Living along the cultural borders of Latin America and the United States forms a sense of identity, provides various perspectives of the world and thus creates an equal love for both cultures. Bicultural individuals struggle with the advantages of being able to understand two cultures and the disadvantages of not knowing where we fit in.

"The first significant trio of pianist Bill Evans was created with the goal of achieving what Evans called ""simultaneous improvisation."" Formed in 1959 and featuring bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian, this ensemble forged a more balanced trio dynamic than was customary. The soloist-oriented language of postwar jazz generally relegated the bassist and drummer of a piano trio to subordinate roles; by contrast, LaFaro and Motian were granted an unprecedented degree of musical freedom. Most significantly, a form of improvisational dialogue dominated the Trio\'s work, rather than a traditional sequence of solos. While many musicians of the 1950s subverted conventional jazz forms and structures, the Evans Trio practiced their collective improvisation within standard harmonic and formal constraints. Despite this conservatism, the Trio embraced the same burgeoning philosophy of creative and improvisational freedom that characterized the more rebellious music that would come to be known as ""free jazz.""

"""Words have been a part of pictorial art for centuries. Their appearances range from Egyptian hieroglyphs to embellished letters in illuminated manuscripts to Surrealist word-images. Although the latter part of the twentieth century has seen the proliferation of the word in art, as many modern artists explore its potentialities, critics have often let the words speak for themselves and have not examined the meaning of their presence. An evaluation of the work of Roy Lichtenstein (a pop artist famed for his 'comics'), James Johnson (a relatively unknown Colorado-based artist), and Jenny Holzer (known for her electronic signboards) reveals that these radically divergent artists all exploit the qualities of the word to increase the disturbing and disquieting effects of their work and to challenge multiple degrees of authority.

"""Cindy Sherman, artist, model, and performance artist, produced more than eighty works collectively known as the Untitled Film Stills between 1977 and 1980. Acting as both the photographer and subject of these stills, Sherman used props, makeup, and costumes to loosely cite images of women in films and magazines, simultaneously reflecting and manipulating the viewer's concepts of gender, narrative structure, and codes of representation. I will explore the extent to which semiotics, psychoanalysis, counter-psychoanalysis, and mimesis play roles in Sherman's work as well as how Sherman utilizes/ resists the idea of the feminine masquerade in these photographs.

"One of the weakest areas of education today is the middle school science curriculum. During the last decade, educators have been reforming curricula to raise the standards of science education. An example of such a curriculum is the use of dinosaurs to teach geology. This curriculum provides educators with a series of activities that will allow students a hands-on opportunity to explore the earth sciences. Through an inquiry approach to dinosaur studies students will explore the formation of the earth, the deposition of sediment, the interdependency of living organisms, evolution, extinction, fossil excavation, and radiometric dating techniques. Furthermore, dinosaur studies offer the opportunity of incorporating other sciences such as physics, chemistry, math, and biology into the classroom. The interdisciplinary element of this curriculum conveys to the students that math and chemistry are not subjects only applied in the classroom, but in our everyday lives. '"

"""The use of demonstrations is recognized as a highly effective tool in the teaching of physics. Currently teachers do not have access to videos from which accurate quantitative measurements of physics in microgravity can be made. Such simple examples as playing catch or bubbles floating to the surface of a liquid illustrate how gravitational effects influence our intuition and show the effects of microgravity on everyday physics phenomena. This March, a team of four students traveled to NASA's Johnson Space Center to fly on the KC-135 aircraft, a plane whose parabolic flight path results in periods of microgravity. A video of basic mechanics demonstrations in microgravity was filmed during the flights. These demonstrations will serve a dual purpose: not only can they be a resource for high school and introductory college level physics courses, but they can also be used to motivate young girls to pursue the sciences.

Building on these assignments, at the end of the semester we began our independent work, focusing on individual style and on personally tailored advanced problems in drawing. The work we are proud to present displays examples of our lessons throughout the course as well as our final independent projects. '"
"Vernacular architecture is not the creation of academically trained designers or builders. Rather, it is the reflection of local needs and tradition. Design and construction methods are passed down orally, old forms serve as models for new, and local materials are used. While architectural changes come slowly under these constraints, reinterpretation of old forms is necessary in order to meet the evolving needs of those who utilize the buildings. This hypothesis is supported with a slide presentation and discussion of four Quaker meeting houses in southeastern Massachusetts - Sandwich, Yarmouth, and Falmouth on Cape Cod, and Apponegansett on the mainland. The latter eighteenth-century building illustrates the ""typical"" New England Quaker meeting house form. Original features from the three nineteenth-century meeting houses demonstrate how local traditions and practical factors contributed to modifications of that form. Later renovations give further evidence that vernacular architecture responds to social, economic, and religious changes. '"
"""Thousands of men who sailed from ports in New England during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries aboard merchant, whaling, and fishing vessels died while still at sea. The survival of their wives, children, and parents, who were left without a bread-winning husband, father, or son, was closely linked to the lost man's specific place in the strictly hierarchical maritime culture. The continuation of this hierarchy after death, as experienced by the surviving families, was sustained through custom, regulation, and law. This is illustrated clearly in primary-source documentation from the time period, including ships' logs, personal letters of seamen and their families, newspaper articles, American consular letters, and records from the beneficent fraternal organizations of ships' officers. This research was done at the G.W. Blunt White Maritime Library at Mystic Seaport Museum during the fall 1997 term of the Williams College-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program. """
"""Among all of the intriguing aspects of the American Civil War is buried perhaps the most fascinating: the phenomenon of the estimated four hundred women from both North and South who enlisted as men and lived and fought as male soldiers. Who were they? What was their experience in the war? Most importantly, why did they do what they did? The failure of the contemporary propaganda to satisfy the needs and desires of the women of the Union and Confederacy was perhaps the chief cause of their unorthodox actions. This failure stemmed from the contrast in women's and men's roles in this era, and the solution these four hundred women independently struck on - in essence, to become men - was uniquely effective.

"""Frederick Law Olmsted, the father of American landscape architecture, created many extraordinary landscapes. An understanding of Olmsted's visionary designs and the mechanisms by which these landscapes function may be gained by applying, to the Olmstedian landscape, Edward 0. Wilson's biophilia hypothesis. An extension of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, biophilia is a positive, innate response to specific aspects of the natural landscape. The biophilic response is triggered because these landscape features were indicators of favorable conditions crucial to early man's survival, such as food, water and safety. Olmsted generously employed specific landscape features with the intent of promoting such positive responses. Although Wilson formally defined the biophilia hypothesis more than 120 years after Olmsted began his career, there is convincing evidence that Olmsted relied on his own innate sense of biophilia as a significant underlying design principle.

"""Attitude and motivation to learn a language evolve as a result of the interaction of many factors, including the role of parents, peers, and teachers in influencing the learner; how strongly the learner identifies with the target culture; and how much the learner wishes to succeed in the language to improve career prospects or social status or to meet an educational requirement. A study was conducted using international students from Wellesley and elsewhere to ascertain which of the above factors significantly contributed to subjects' high performance on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Subjects completed a questionnaire rating how strongly each of 60 items influenced their language learning experience.

"The long-term implications of resiliency, or the ability to approach life in a flexible and adaptive manner were investigated using data from a longitudinal study. Participants in the longitudinal study were interviewed in late adolescence (in the 1930s) and subsequently four times in adulthood (when they were in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and 70s). Results support the hypothesis that resilient adolescents show greater life satisfaction and better mental health in old age than their less resilient counterparts. Some of the concurrent correlates of resiliency in adolescence, such as social class and family conflict, were also explored. '"
"Adolescence is a time when we begin to explore answers to the question ""Who am I?"" According to Erik Erikson, some individuals develop a firm sense of identity in adolescence while others continue to explore their identity well into adulthood. I use data from a longitudinal study of men and women to investigate the implications of these two types of identity formation for psychosocial functioning in old age. My findings indicate that individuals who achieve a sense of identity early on in life turn into adults who are satisfied with their life but who are also quite conventional. In contrast, those individuals who postpone identity formation in adolescence are likely in old age to be more open to new experience and to be receptive to new ideas. '"

"Although Milton\'s Paradise Lost, with its biblical topic, claims to be historical and universal, it proposes a reading of English history that reevaluates Gaunt\'s vision of the English nation in Shakespeare\'s Richard 11. In Paradise Lost, when Satan first glimpses hell and asks ""Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime / ... / That we must change for Heav\'n, this mournful gloom / For that celestial light?,"" Milton is rewriting Gaunt\'s idealization of England\'s past, his ""scept\'red isle"" speech: ""This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England."" Outside of history, Milton\'s Satan accepts history in a way that Gaunt does not, internalizing place and historical process rather than choosing the ultimately unfulfilling and unproductive path of nostalgia. Intent on the future, Satan\'s energies are imperialistic rather than nationalistic, but, because he himself embodies hell, his imperialism is ultimately as unsatisfying as Gaunt\'s appeals to England\'s lost past.

In 1959, Chinua Achebe published Things Fall Apart, a .novel about an African tribe before and after colonial exposure. Critics revered Achebe\'s work because it delivered not only a voice, but also an identity, to ""that dumb thing"" silenced by Conrad.

"""As philosophical inquiry and religion intersect, the struggle between reason and faith becomes central. For political thought, the outcome of this discourse determines how the community is shaped. Thomas Aquinas, Ibn Rushd and Muhammad 'Abduh, despite their different eras and traditions, are each drawn to this problem. For lbn Rushd and Abduh, the problem is whether philosophy has a place in the Muslim tradition of revealed truth. If so, what are the implications for wisdom and authority in the community? For Aquinas, the concern is finding a place for critical reason in Christianity and discovering what it could mean for social hierarchy and law. Because they address the same question, these three theorists invite comparison. However, the task itself raises new questions about comparing across time and culture. Therefore, it might be necessary to frame this traditional debate differently to engage with the work of each philosopher and find effective bases for comparison. """

"""Throughout Chinese poetic tradition, poetry has always retained a very strong autobiographical flavor. A poet's external and internal worlds transform, join, and integrate to create poems whose web of words capture an enlivened personal experience. This presentation will explore in detail a case of such integration in two exemplary classical Chinese poets, Li Bo (701-762) and Wang Wei (699-761): I will discuss the impact of these poets' religious beliefs on their poetic styles, and the reflection of their unconventional comprehension of religion through their poetry. Li Bo's adoption of Taoism leads him to celebrate the world of motion in his poetry, whereas Wang Wei's internalization of Buddhism directs him to capture a world of tranquillity. Despite their different religious beliefs, both poets reached a similar enlightened attitude towards life. Their poetry displays freedom of the mind, enabling them to transcend social standards and worldly matters, while continuing to inspire readers across time, space, and culture. """

During the summer of 1998, I worked in northern Wisconsin and arctic Alaska studying an important grazer in freshwater lakes: Daphnia pulex. In bottle experiments, D. pulex were given a phosphate supplement and their growth rate was measured. The growing season is much shorter in Alaska than in Wisconsin, and D. pulex populations in Alaska have a faster growth rate. Changes in cell content to achieve this faster growth rate change the nitrogen:phosphorus ratio of the organism, and put the organism at a greater potential for phosphorus limitation. If the D. pulex populations in Alaska are limited by phosphorus, they should exhibit a greater increase in growth rate in response to the phosphorus addition than the D. pulex populations in Wisconsin. Ecological stoichiometry ties together ecosystem dynamics and cellular biology.'"
"Males and females perform differently on cognitive tasks thought to involve the cholinergic neurotransmitter system of the brain. For example, males are better than females at spatial memory tasks. The major source of cholinergic input to the ""cognitive"" regions of the brain arises from subcortical neurons residing in the basal forebrain (BF). Previous studies in rodents have shown that the BF cholinergic system develops differentially in males and females, with the system maturing faster in females. No one, however, has determined if differences in the developing cholinergic system exist from inception (birth of cholinergic neurons in the BF). The purpose of this study is to examine if there are sex differences in the neurogenesis (birthdate) of BF cholinergic neurons in mice. Pregnant mice will be injected with a birthdating agent, which is incorporated into the DNA of actively dividing fetal cells. The brains from the offspring of the injected mice will be processed for the presence of the birthdating agent and a cholinergic marker. Neurons in the BF which have both labels will be counted and compared between the sexes. '"
"""We examined changes in membrane fluidity of Rhododendron maximum leaves in response to short-term changes in temperature. After exposing leaves to temperatures between 5 and 35 \xc2\xb7c for 45 minutes the half-time of chlorophyll a fluorescence decay was measured and the membrane fluidity was calculated. Our results showed that membrane fluidity of leaves harvested in the fall and winter did not change in response to exposures at these temperatures. These findings were in contrast to results from similar experiments     Population Dynamics of Terrestrial Slugs Limax maximus and Arion ater in Eight Forest Fragments on the Wellesley College Campus, Wellesley, Massachusetts Sophie Parker, Biological Sciences '99 """
"Patterns in habitat disturbance may be revealed through an examination of the differences in the terrestrial gastropod populations of forest fragments with separate land use histories. Slug populations in eight forest patches were enumerated and the length of individual slugs was measured. Determinations were made of the percent soil moisture, percent canopy cover, leaf litter depth, and soil nutrient concentration of each forest patch. Sites with higher soil moisture and nutrient content and less canopy cover and leaf litter had higher total slug population. I incorporated these findings into an age-structured simulation model that predicts R, the net reproductive rate of the slug population, given specific environmental conditions. Calcium concentration of the soil was strongly correlated with slug population size in each site. The model predicts that R < 1 in seven of the forest fragments, indicating that slug population in these patches may be sustained by immigration from nearby lawns. '"
"Ichthyosaurs were a group of highly adapted, obligate marine reptiles in the Mesozoic Era that were common and widespread inhabitants of inland seas worldwide during most of the Triassic and Jurassic. This thesis focuses on analyzing the swimming style of the Jurassic ichthyosaur Baptanodon, a study based on a comparison of the body shape and vertebral column of the genus to that of thunniform bony and cartilaginous fish (e.g. tunas) and of dolphins and porpoises, which we believe sheds light on the flexibility of the vertebral column and swimming style of the extinct reptile. The project involved the collection of an ichthyosaur specimen in the Jurassic Sundance Formation of Wyoming, reconstruction of the fragmentary fossil, documentation of its vertebral morphology, comparison of this morphology with that known from other ichthyosaurs, and physical modeling of vertebral flexibility given variations of vertebral shape and count.

"Cyanobacteria store nitrogen in a polypeptide called cyanophycin (CGP). Our research has focused on the development of reliable methods for identifying and quantifying cyanophycinase, the enzyme which breaks down CGP, in cell extracts. CGP is highly insoluble, making most direct assays difficult and poorly reproducible. Gel electrophoresis using gels permeated with protease substrates revealed that cell extracts contain several enzymes, including some with molecular weights corresponding to that of cyanophycinase, capable of digesting casein. Since casein might be a suitable substrate for cyanophycinase, yellow casein was used in a colorimetric assay. In tests of crude cell extracts, casein digestion was observed after incubation. Current work focuses on the optimization of the yellow-casein assay. Another approach investigated has been the possibility of permeating gels with CGP itself and using these gels to test cell extracts. Although difficult to carry out, such an assay would offer far greater specificity than replacement-substrate assays. '"

The festival became an institution by decree in Burkina Faso and is now held biennially. Its purpose was to contribute to the expansion and development of African cinema as a means of expression, education and awareness. Five film students have been given the opportunity to attend this festival and expand their horizons as far as their knowledge of films is concerned. What will they gain from this experience? How wilt it help in their development as student filmmakers? Video documentation focusing on their experiences in Ouagadougou will be shown. '"
"This year\'s theme at the 1999 FESPACO, the Pan-African Film Festival in Burkina Faso, is distribution. As the proverb goes, ""Whoever controls distribution, controls cinema."" The economic power of film distribution, despite the continual growth of African Cinema since its inception in the 1960s, is still dominated by foreign-based companies, preventing the establishment of strong domestic film industry and impeding the creation of national cinemas on the cultural, economic, political, and social levels. While inventing an aesthetic of Black African Cinema within the world tradition, artists are attempting to balance socio-political filmmaking and the preservation of indigenous cultural traditions with commercially viable creations. Interviews with filmmakers, producers, international film scholars, and festival participants will present an overview of the current distribution crisis affecting the production and funding of contemporary African film both on the local and the global scale.

"""Law of the Sea is the oldest and most controversial area of international law today. As soon as fishing became profitable, property of the sea became an important issue in international law. World powers first dictated these laws, but by the sixteenth century, a three-mile 'protection' zone was established among nations. Following World War II, Latin American states emerged as independent world actors that challenged existing international law based on the depletion of the fish stocks near their coastal shores. Chile, Equador, and Peru passed laws which extended their territorial seas to 200 miles. Over the next thirty years, a United Nations Convention met to codify Jaw of the sea; they drafted a set of international norms which now regulate territorial seas and conserve natural resources. Presently, disagreements in areas such as the Falkland/Malvinas Islands have erupted to challenge the transgressors of these international norms. """

"Current debates about social and economic inequality center on competing concepts of fairness and equal opportunity. While many Americans deny the existence of a class structure, others acknowledge that opportunities for socioeconomic attainment and political power vary according to race, ethnicity, and gender. This panel discussion will offer a multifaceted examination of social and economic inequality in America. We will outline techniques for measuring inequality and quantify the extent to which certain groups experience social and economic advantage and disadvantage. We will also present theoretical explanations for understanding the emergence and persistence of social inequality in America. Finally, we will outline recent economic, legal, and political attempts to address inequality in America, with particular attention given to the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and ongoing legal debates regarding affirmative action programs (in both education and employment) and school voucher systems.

"The Jewett Sculpture Court originally served as a display area for the Wellesley College sculpture collection. Since the construction of the Davis Museum, this space has lacked a specific program and often remains empty. This redesign provides a program for this valuable but currently underused space. The existing architecture of the Sculpture Court, bordered by the open stairwell, implies that the space should be experienced not only as a single room, but as part of a vertical corridor connecting multiple horizontal spaces. The Sculpture Court, suspended between the second and third floors, deconstructs the traditional building organization from discreet horizontal layering to a fluid vertical integration of space. The redesign is based on this concept and incorporates a number of spaces to enhance the feeling of continuity. Using the Sculpture Court as the central focus, the redesign creates a series of spaces that are perceptually connected. '"

Specific themes to be investigated include changes in the labor force and domestic economy, the shift from traditional values to Western practices and ideals, and recent migration patterns within the region. Ultimately, these changes have affected the dynamics of women's lives and in turn, play an important role in shaping family dynamics within the region. """
"""This study is a further investigation into the phenomenon of the tontine in Senegalese society - in particular Senegalese women's society - and the conditions in the society that gave rise to this phenomenon. Two tontines were surveyed: one in a small regional town of Senegal, Bargny (forty-five minutes from Dakar, the capital) and one in a neighborhood of the Dakar (Point E). Each group was interviewed and completed questionnaires. The main difference between the tontines was the necessity of their tontine's financial support. The women of Bargny did not have alternatives available to them. Banks were far from their reach. Therefore, the money that their tontine offered was their only resource for credit and savings. In Point E the women had a variety of organizations that support them and their efforts. Therefore, their membership in the tontine, though helpful, was not vital. Both tontines possessed the essential ingredient of solidarity and mutual aid. """

"Art museums have been dealing with the growing controversy involving art looted by Nazis from Holocaust victims. A significant number of these looted art works are now on the walls of prestigious museums. Museums that claim that the purchase is done in good faith, often find themselves in a moral dilemma. The looted art poses a threat to the integrity of the museum. As the cases of Nazi looted art illustrate, the art world has been relatively indifferent to the ethics surrounding the acquisition of looted art. With lax laws, museums have continued to acquire art works which have no record of prior ownership or have a connection to illegal excavation and smuggling. An increased awareness of these unethical collecting behaviors prompted the need for ethical guidelines in the art market. '"
"""The Palestinian Question is frequently considered to be the central issue of conflict in the Middle East today, as it has been since the establishment of the Israeli state in May 1948. Recent trends in the scholarly historiography of the Israeli/ Arab conflict have shaped the course of this heated debate. The opening of British and Israeli state archives twenty years ago led to a Revisionist historiography movement, in which a number of authors analyzed newly available documents, contesting Israeli-supported myths about 1948 and the events leading up to it. The Palestinian Intifada, or grassroots uprising (1987-1992), led to a different wave of critical historiography focusing on Israeli human rights abuses, Palestinian self-determination, and women's contributions within the resistance movement. While the Revisionist scholars emphasize that they are writing history and not memory, Intifada authors claim their credibility lies in their more subjective and personal analysis. """
"Critics have attacked the musical of Hollywood\'s ""golden era"" for unrealistically portraying an ethnically diverse America with homogeneously white characters, themes and settings. Considering, however, that Hollywood was founded by Eastern European Jewish immigrants who were caught in the struggle of mediating between the Old World and the New, the absence of ethnicity in their films hardly seems plausible. The musical was the only genre in which the movie moguls could most effectively assert the importance of entertainment in the lives of the audience and thereby justify their own positions as the nation\'s arbiter of such entertainment. The musical also evoked nostalgia for strong families and communities, something that was lacking in the moguls\' poverty-stricken youth. As a result, the seemingly escapist musicals of Hollywood\'s golden era demonstrate the moguls\' insecurity, arising out of their Jewishness and immigrant status, of holding positions of power in a Gentile society.

"In 1887, Mary Alice Knox taught the first course in the History of Oriental Civilization at Wellesley College. The course was taught by the ""modern laboratory method"" and with photographs that she had collected during her travels in Japan. These photographs are in the collection of Wellesley\'s Davis Museum now and were shown at the Wellesley College Museum in 1988 along with related photographs from Harvard\'s Peabody Museum in the exhibition, A Timely Encounter. The subjects of the photographs are Japanese, but the photographers were European. Taken at the precarious moment in the development of Japanese relations with the West, the photographs are important objects in the understanding of how cultures impact and relate to one another. Also, because Japan was in the formative years of the Meiji Restoration at the time the photographs were taken, the Knox collection can give us insight into Japan\'s transition into modernity. '"
"The White River Formation near Douglas, Wyoming consists of volcanic ash-rich sediments interbedded with several layers of volcanic ash, or tuffs. Abundant mammal fossils facilitate biostratigraphic zonation and location of the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. 40Ar/39Ar radiometric ages on biotite have been determined for a sample located just above the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, Tuff 5, and another sample, Tuff 7Q. These tuffs yield ages of 33.5 \xc2\xb1 0.8 and 30.7 \xc2\xb1 0.9 million years (Ma), respectively. Preliminary analysis of Tuff 7Q, using the U/Pb method on zircons, additionally yields an age of 32.9 \xc2\xb1 0.2 Ma, possibly a more accurate age. Further U/Pb analyses on 7 tufts, including Tuff 5 and Tuff 7Q, will constitute the first such geochronology of White River luffs and will allow their correlation with others in surrounding states. These analyses will also help to locate the Orellan-Whitneyan land mammal age boundary within the Douglas section, characterize rates of climatic change and place these tufts in the global time scale for the Oligocene.

"Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to quantitatively study the effects of anterior uveitis, and treatment with 1% prednisolone acetate or saline, on blood-aqueous barrier permeability in rabbit eyes. Uveitis was induced by subcutaneous injection of tuberculosis antigen followed 10 days later by injection of a centrifuged microparticulate suspension of antigen into the vitreous cavity of one eye of each rabbit. Prior to uveitis induction, and one, eight, and fifteen days after uveitis induction, Tl-weighted MR imaging was carried out on a Bruker Biospec 2T MRI system. ParaVision software was used to analyze the intensity of several regions of the image, from which spatial and kinetic data were obtained. Differences have been found in the kinetics and spatial distribution of contrast agent (Magnevist) in normal rabbit eyes, uveitic eyes, and eyes treated with 1 % prednisolone acetate or saline. '"
"A prime p is a prime divisor of a polynomial f(x) if there is an integer m such that f(m) is divisible by p. For example, if f(x) = x2 + 1, then 2, 5, and 13 are prime divisors of f(x) since 12 + 1 = 2, 22 + 1 = 5 and 52 + 1 = 26 = 2 X 13. Furthermore, it can be shown that the prime divisors of f(x) = x2 + 1 are 2 and all of the primes p for which the remainder is 1 when p is divided by 4. In my thesis, I am looking at a special class of polynomials and trying to classify the prime divisors of polynomials in that class. In my poster, I describe some basic concepts from number theory which I have used in my thesis as well as giving a more in depth look at the questions that I am exploring. '"
"""Standardized odor attractant tablets are often used as tools in the study of predator ecology, particularly with scent stations to assess mammalian predator populations. Despite their frequent use, little has been done to determine how far predators can smell these tablets, or how the distance of first detection varies with changes in weather conditions. Two Australian Shepherds and one Samoyed, all obedience and agility trained, were used to study how far standard odor attractant tablets can be detected. The greatest downwind distance a test dog was able to detect odor from a tablet was 1,029 meters. This occurred with 85 % relative humidity, an air temperature of 74\xc2\xb7 F, and a slight breeze ( < 1 mph). Changes in the dogs' first detection distances appear to be correlated with wind and other weather conditions. This information may aid researchers in estimating the distances from which wild predators are attracted to scent stations. """
"""The chamber music of the two great composers, Brahms and Dvorak, contains the most intimate musical thoughts. As performers, we understand that performance of such intimate works is an act of cocreation.

In order to be successful cocreators we must study the scores carefully and interpret even the smallest musical details. What we, as performers, bring to the music is reflected in every subtle nuance and shade, and an understanding of this can only enhance the enjoyment experienced by both the audience and ourselves. We use our many and varied talents to create a unified interpretation of the music. A piece of music is the product of creation, and performance is the act of molding that creation into something tangible, thus becoming an act of creation in and of itself.

"The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6308, which normally grows in a medium of pH 8, is able to tolerate acid shock as low as pH 3. Within minutes, cells that survive acid shock also neutralize the external medium to around pH 6 suggesting this response is needed for survival through acidic conditions. A variety of experiments were carried out to study this acid tolerance response. Acid shocked exponentially growing cells that were able to tolerate acid shock returned to exponential growth after a lag phase. In vivo 31 P-NMR spectroscopy revealed that during acid shock, cells did not lyse and the internal pH of the cells was lowered by, but was not equivalent to, the acidic pH medium. SOS-PAGE and pulse labeling experiments revealed the role of several possible chaperone proteins in this response. '"
"All known organisms respond to environmental stresses by decreasing overall protein synthesis and increasing the production of certain specific proteins. During heat stress, these proteins are called heat shock proteins (Hsps) and among other functions, they help the cell to overcome stress by aiding cellular proteins to remain in the correct configuration. The goal of this research is to identify potential heat shock proteins in the cyanobacterial strain Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6308. The cells, which normally grow at 35""C, were shocked at 45""C and their proteins examined by SOS PAGE, immunoblotting and autoradiography pulse experiments. Autoradiography revealed differential protein synthesis over time: many proteins were made up to 10 min. into heat shock, after which overall protein synthesis drastically decreased. Several high and low molecular weight proteins have been identified as potential Hsps, three of which have been shown to cross-react with antibodies to Hsps from other bacterial species. '"
"Cyanobacteria produce polyphosphate when they are starved for sulfur in the presence of excess phosphate. In order to determine if other inhibitors of protein synthesis would also increase the polyphosphate content of cells, the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was grown in the presence of lincomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor that inhibits the transcription of RNA in Gram negative bacteria. Lincomycin was added to cells once they entered exponential growth. A concentration of 0.5 \xc2\xb5g/ml lincomycin caused the leveling off of the growth rate. If more than 0.5 \xc2\xb5g/ml lincomycin was added, the cells lysed; if less, the cells continued exponential growth. The absence of polyphosphate was determined using NMR spectroscopy. Other inhibitors of transcription and translation, such as chlorotetracycline, will also be tested for their ability to cause polyphosphate formation. '"
"Scapular stability is part of upper body strength that is often ignored. Typical upper body strengthening exercises, such as the bench press and the overhead press, do not address the scapula. Scapular stability can, however, play a key role in shoulder injuries. The Athletic Training staff of Wellesley College focuses on shoulder stability as part of the prescreening program for all varsity athletes, because of the strong correlation between stability and injury. The human shoulder joint is very unstable, compared to other joints. Because of the greater range of motion that occurs in the shoulder joint, the stability must come from muscles rather than ligaments. The shoulder is susceptible to subluxation or dislocation when the muscles are not strong. The scapular stabilizers not only help with injury prevention, but also with overall upper body strength. Ever wonder why you cannot do a push up? Weak shoulder stabilizers could be part of the problem. There are a number of simple exercises that can help strengthen scapular stabilizers and assist that can help strengthen scapular stabilizers and assist with shoulder strength, as well as help prevent shoulder injury.

"""Induction of microgyria in early infancy to the cerebral cortex of rats produces effects that mimic ectopias and anomalies exhibited in human dyslexic brains. This microgyria induction results in long lasting behavior deficits in auditory processing. Deficits in audition are congruent with processing deficits observed in dyslexic children. In human children, ectopias have been observed in the parietal, frontal, and temporal cortices. The current study measured the effects of frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lesions on the medial geniculate nucleus' (MGN, a region concerned with audition) neuronal size in rats. As in previous experiments, lesioned males suffered more dramatically than females. However, in contrast to former studies, only caudal lesions produced significant results in males - whereas prior studies maintained that only rostral lesions provoked significant MGN neuronal size differences (when compared to controls). Further experiments must be conducted to fully understand connections between the MGN and regions of cerebral cortex. """
"""Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a disorder which is marked by progressive dementia including impairment of spatial learning. Previous research suggests that the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP-Cl00) may be linked to the cognitive deficits seen in AD, and that mice which overexpress C-100 are impaired on cognitive spatial tasks. To test whether the amount of expression of C-100 affects the age of onset of spatial deficits or the magnitude of deficits, mice were genetically manipulated to overexpress either one (heterozygotes) or two (homozygotes) copies of the C-100 gene. Animals at four months and eight months old were tested in each group in a spatial task called the Morris Water Maze. Eight month-old homozygotes showed the most spatial impairment and homozygotes at both ages showed deficits when compared to controls and heterozygotes. These findings suggest that C-100 may be linked to age-related spatial deficits in mice. """
"Previous experiments have determined that when cyanobacteria undergoes nutrient deprivation there is a marked increase in the amount of cyanophycin peptide granule present in the system. This level has also been noted to decline upon introduction of these nutrients to the biological system. Earlier examinations of this phenomenon, diluted the media during introduction a fact of which has been shown to mask some of the growth parameters, that were previously unseen. This current study was undertaken to determine if the increase and decline in cyanophycin can be quantifiably examined using NMR analysis, which theoretically would show the characteristic increase in nitrogen storage in deprived cells.

"In the middle of the first century BC, Lucretius, a Roman poet and philosopher, wrote the De rerum natura, an epic poem that laid forth the doctrines of Epicurean philosophy. Epicureanism is a hedonic philosophy, defining individual pleasure as the ultimate good. In the De rerum natura, Lucretius identifies an organized, political society as necessary for the attainment of individual happiness. Simultaneously, however, he argues that actual political involvement threatens that happiness.

Seven participants were asked to consider the issue of privacy, noting their thoughts and feelings. Each participant then gathered pictures to illustrate their ideas. The pictures and other sensory metaphors served as stimuli for one-on-one, in-depth interviews and as ingredients to construct summary collages, aided by a digital imaging specialist. Initial analysis consisted of identifying, labeling, and defining ideas or constructs. Constructs mentioned frequently in related pairs created a mental model or consensus map of privacy. Recurring topics were identified as thematic metaphors. Further analysis revealed deep metaphors: overarching concepts forming the most fundamental orientations people use to organize their thoughts and feelings about privacy. The summary digital images illustrate the themes and deep metaphors underlying peoples' thoughts and feelings about privacy. """
"This paper explores the nature of the social interaction that occurs between members of a jury during the process of deliberations. The jury is understood as a body that is both demographically representative and deliberative, as it brings people of various backgrounds to a face-to-face discussion. Although institutional and procedural norms within the jury system emphasize the principle of equal status among jurors, jury studies and small group research have demonstrated that power and influence within the jury are often disproportionate by class, gender, and race. Within jury deliberations, I have identified several locations in which the process of status generalization may allow external power and prestige differentials to operate inside the jury room. I have surveyed jurors on fourteen criminal and civil trials in Massachusetts courts to determine the roles played by class, gender, and race in foreperson selection and leadership, individual speaking time, and the topics emphasized by jurors.

"The frequency and magnitude of refugee flows produced by ethnic conflict in the post-Cold War period have forced the international community to reconsider its consistent rejection of repatriation as a viable solution to forced migration. If repatriation is to be successful, returning refugees must be reintegrated into communities torn by internecine warfare. Simultaneously, these communities must be socially rehabilitated and economically revitalized. Microcredit lending programs operate on the concept that community participation can be used to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Three repatriation programs established for the former Yugoslavia have incorporated lending schemes as a reintegration tool, and are evaluated on their ability to aid returnees and communities in post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction.

"""In my thesis I investigate two primary subjects, nationalism and Turkey. First, I examine theories on nationalism and nation formation. Turkey represents the second focus of the thesis. I have chosen Turkey not only because I am Turkish, but also because different theories of nationalism can be applied to the emergence, growth, and future visions of the Turkish national identity. Here, Turkey's denial of killings of Armenians in 1915 and Armenia's insistence on an apology from the Turkish government provide insights into various aspects of Turkish nationalism. In light of these points, my thesis begins with an application of theories of nationalism to Turkey. It follows with how the Armenian case reveals the identity problem of the Turkish nation. This will lead into the concluding analysis of the possible structural and internal pressures that might impinge on the character of Turkish nationalism. By referring to the role played by the 1915 massacres and the formation of the Turkic Central Asian states, the thesis overall examines how Turkish-Armenian relations today reveal important characteristics of the Turkish national identity.

"Hamas and Gush Emunim, a Palestinian Islamic and an Israeli Jewish group, respectively, are each struggling to shape both the future identity of their communities and the outcome of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Each group has been popularly described by the controversial and ambiguous label of ""fundamentalist"". However, on close examination this designation proves to be both inadequate and imprecise. Nevertheless, a comparison of the roots, ideologies, goals, and methods of Hamas and Gush Emunim sheds light on their similarities and differences and also on the changing relationship between religion and politics, specifically the introduction of the very use of modernity to counter modernity. Their conceptions of the ideal state and philosophies of coexistence are especially important in contributing to the challenges of the peace process. '"
"In July 1979, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) seized control of the Nicaraguan government. The FSLN introduced methods of collective organization and broad-based democratic community participation to attack the national problem of poverty. Health care is an area in which Sandinista policy was most effective, as it converted many Nicaraguan people into actors of their own political and physical fates. Despite the September 1990 electoral defeat, examination of contemporary Nicaraguan society suggests that the FSLN is still an important actor in Nicaragua. The response to the devastating visit of Hurricane Mitch from October 22nd to November 1st of 1998 is one indication of the Sandinista legacy. Women in Hurricane Mitch camps refused to be victims and staked out a role in shaping their own political fates. The presentation uses interviews collected in refugee camps to illustrate how women drew upon Sandinista models for popular participation and formed community-based collectives to organize relief efforts.

"The ""Re-Birth "" Process is an euphemistic name given by the Bulgarian government to a set of policies that severely discriminated against the Muslim Bulgarian population of Turkish descent, which has lived in the country since the 16th century, when Bulgaria was under Ottoman rule. The series of oppressive acts included the forceful changing of the names of all Turkish and Muslim people into Slavic Christian names, religious persecution, the destruction of health and other administrative records, and the expulsion of about 300,000 people from the country in the summer of 1989. This policy of active discrimination lasted from 1984 until the fall of the Communist regime in 1990, and women have been specifically targeted. Examples of oppression aimed at women include job dismissals, forceful separation from their families, group rapes, arrests, torture, and tearing of traditional clothing from women\'s bodies in public. The paper will analyze identity issues across generations of women resulting from the rebirth process and will also discuss the choices that these women have, as well as their exclusion from the agenda of both Bulgarian and Turkish feminist women.

A theoretical section including analysis of the qualitative and quantitative data using anthropological theory will be in the conclusion of the paper. '"
"By the 1970s, Soviet industrialization had stamped its environmental legacy on the landscape of the Autonomous Republic of Karelia: vast forests vanished from the countryside, and snow fell mixed with black soot in the cities. Despite the repression of free speech in the Soviet Union, a brave group of biologists and foresters joined together to try to change environmental policies and encourage the study of ecology. In the late 1980s, the scientists\' efforts yielded fruit as glasnost carried their environmental warnings out of closed laboratories and into general consciousness. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many social organizations, gifted in raising public commotion, focused their attention on environmental safety while the voices of the scientists who pioneered ecological research nearly disappeared amid the ""green fever"". Today, environmental management is often led, not by science and scientific principles of ecology, but by social demand. (Research in Karelia supported by a Schiff Fellowship) '"
"""As it grows out of its position as a British colony and assumes its new role within China, Hong Kong is in a dynamic state of transition. We propose to discuss how the changes at work there permeate Hong Kong culture. In our summer as Elisabeth Luce Moore '24 Wellesley-Yenching Interns, we explored current issues in environmental science, politics, the arts, and educational technology. Cynthia will discuss how the Pearl River Estuary Pollution Project, a joint environmental research project between Hong Kong and mainland China, exposes the challenges facing Hong Kong in cleaning up its environment. Malinda will discuss Hong Kong's unfolding political identity as it takes part in an unprecedented one-country-two systems framework. Ting will discuss how Hong Kong is attempting to further develop its own distinct cultural identity through the arts, and Kristin will present a multimedia exploration of the summer experience as a whole.

"""When Adam and Eve left the garden of Eden, they became the world's first immigrants. Since then, men and women have been moving around the globe and bringing disparate cultures into contact with each other. This panel presents findings from original research conducted by students on a range of topics dealing with migration. Each student defined her own question, devised her own research methodology, carried out her own research project, and analyzed her data. Our studies cover a range of topics including ethnic entrepreneurship, ethnic churches, and transnational migration. """
"As part of a lab project in plant biology (BISC 207), we tested the anti-microbial properties of extracts from ten different plant species with supposed medicinal properties. The microbes that were used included usually benign bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, as well as potentially harmful microbes such as Staphylococcus epidermis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Candida albicans. Our results showed that the ability of the extracts to inhibit microbial growth was influenced by: (1)\tthe quality of the starting material (fresh samples; samples dried in the sun or shade; samples obtained from a store) (2)\tthe plant part, and (3)\tthe extraction method (extractions using cold water, hot water, or alcohol; essential oils obtained from a store) Several plant species showed no anti\xc2\xadmicrobial properties even if the extracts were prepared according to the recommendations in books on medicinal plants or if commercial extracts were used.

"Proteoglycans comprise a class of molecules characterized by a protein core with covalently linked side chains of repeating disaccharides known as glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are a category of proteoglycans that influence neural development and plasticity throughout adult life. The degree of GAG sidechain sulfation may influence the functions of the proteoglycans to which they are attached. The sulfation of GAG sugar residues is catalyzed by sulfotransferases, and the analysis of these enzymes contributes to understanding proteoglycan function. Chondroitin sulfotransferase (CST) is involved in the modification of certain CSPGs of the CNS. The anatomical localization of the enzyme is unknown; thus, my current work is geared towards assessing the levels of CST mRNA expression within the CNS of early postnatal and adult mice. I am using in situ hybridization to determine the localization of CST mRNA, as well as immunohistochemical procedures to localize the CST enzyme. (Supported by a Beckman Fellowship) '"
"Understanding synapse formation and maintenance in the nervous system requires the characterization of component molecules. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are a heterogeneous class of molecules containing a protein core linked to one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) sidechains. Sulfation of these sidechains may influence CSPG function. Chondroitin sulfotransferases (CSTs) are the enzymes responsible for sulfating CSPG sidechains and may regulate CSPG activity. This project focuses on CST expression in the mouse central nervous system during different developmental stages and maturity using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT\xc2\xadPCR) and Southern blot analysis. Initial results have demonstrated CST expression in the adult mouse cortex and olfactory bulb. Further studies will focus on CST expression in early postnatal development, as well as a more detailed analysis in other brain regions and spinal cord. These studies should provide insight into the role of CSPGs in synapse formation and maintenance in the developing and mature nervous system. '"
"The cytoskeleton has been referred to as the ""bones and muscles"" of the cell: providing structural integrity and enabling cell motility. The cytoskeleton is made up of many proteins, one of which is actin. Actin can exist as a single unit or can be strung together to form long, functional filaments. The resulting meshwork of filamentous actin is essential for many cellular processes, including cell movement, cell growth, and cell division. Actin-binding proteins assist in actin\'s various cellular functions. While many actin binding proteins have been identified and characterized in mammalian cells, little is known about these proteins in plant cells. Recently, our laboratory isolated a novel plant actin-binding protein, called ADB\xc2\xadAtl. ADB-Atl, the subject of these studies, is thought to be a link between the actin cytoskeleton and the plant plasma membrane. Our findings on the molecular genetics, structure, and function of this protein will be presented. '"
"A thioamide was inserted into a 12-residue peptide previously shown to adopt b-hairpin structure. The insertion of the thioamide was accomplished through the use of a thioacylating reagent concomitant with solid phase peptide synthesis. It was hypothesized that this substitution would strengthen the hydrogen bonding, which is the basis of secondary structure formation. A sulfur substitution on an amide has been shown to increase the acidity of the hydrogen bonded to the alpha nitrogen, on the order of 1 to 3 pKa units. The effect of the modified hydrogen bonding on the secondary structure of the peptide was investigated by measuring the population of peptide in b-hairpin formation as compared to the population in random coil. These results were compared to previous work with the unmodified peptide. 2D-NMR was used to analyze the hydrogen bonding between atoms on each strand of the structure, while CD was used to evaluate the ratio of folded peptide to random coil.

"""Cpp-Ala-Ala-Tyr-PABA is an effective in vitro inhibitor of EP 24.15, a thiol-dependent metalopeptidase; however, this inhibitor fails in living systems as it is cleaved at the Ala-Tyr amide bond by neutral endopeptidase. As a result of this cleavage, our understanding of the role of EP 24.15 in living systems is limited. To strengthen the amide bond and prevent cleavage, the oxygen was replaced with a sulfur creating a thioamide variant, Cpp\xc2\xadA-At-Tyr-PABA. As other variations of the inhibitor, such as varying amino acid side chains or non-peptide based inhibition have failed up to this point, the synthetic design of structurally similar but chemically different inhibitors and substrates provides a promising avenue of research for future work in biological chemistry.

"6-Aminoimidazo-2,3-c)-triazole may be viewed as an adenine analog. The synthesis of the model analog, 6-amino-3-phenylimidazo-2,3-c)-triazole was conceived to proceed through the intermediate 3-cyano-4-phenyl-l,2,4)-triazole. Various synthetic strategies resulted in the addition of the cyano substituent at the 3 position of the triazole ring. The most effective of these involved direct cyanation with an electrophilic cyanating agent. Our studies demonstrate that the intermediate cation of phenyltriazole, generated from reaction with cyanogen bromide, in which the cyano group is bonded to one of the nitrogens of the triazole ring, is susceptible to nucleophilic attack at C-3. If the bromide from cyanogen bromide is not removed, the major product is bromophenyltriazole, while the removal of the bromide ion allows for rearrangement of the cyano group to the C-3 position. Alternatively, excess cyanide added to the reaction acts as a nucleophile, attacking C-3 and causing subsequent loss of HCN.'"
"The structure of ice is the ideal hydrogenbonded material. Every oxygen atom is hydrogen bonded to 4 adjacent molecules, by donating hydrogens to make 2 hydrogen bonds and accepting 2 others from neighboring molecules. It is thus the prototypical saturated-hydrogen-bonded (SHB) crystal, in which every donor hydrogen and every acceptor site is used. Recently, equimolar alcohol-amine crystals were recognized as belonging to the SHB family, with a complementary arrangement of -OH groups providing 1 donor and 2 acceptors and -NH2 groups with I acceptor and 2 donors. We have been investigating a third possible class of SHB materials. Secondary amines have a single donor and acceptor on each = NH group which might form a new SHB class. We have searched the Cambridge Structural Database for published structures with this feature and are now determining the structure of piperazine, Likely the first structure in this class. '"
This research is an attempt to use the unique hydrogen-bond properties of equimolar alcohol-amine compounds to grow crystals which are not likely to be obtainable using ordinary growth techniques. We are attempting to use alternating layers of diamines and dials to produce new materials. We have built a vacuum chamber containing molecular ovens which apply the component compounds in the desired order as molecular beams. The beams are designed to deposit a repeating pattern of single layers of a series of compounds on a suitable growth surface. The presentation will give a detailed description of the approach and explain the apparatus design. A progress report on various aspects of the experiments performed to date will be included. '
"3-0eaza-5-aza-9-phenylxanthine is a model xanthosine analog that will be used to determine a strategy for the synthesis of the desired xanthosine analog, 3-deaza-5- azaxanthosine. The challenge in the synthesis of the model analog has been the creation of a carbon-carbon bond at the C3 position of the triazole ring. Although the carbanion of 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazole results in a decomposition to N-phenyl cyanamide, the anion of 3-methyl-4-phenyl-l ,2,4)-triazole is more stable. Reaction of the anion with ethyl chloroformate results in the formation of 3-carbethoxymethyl-4-phenyl- 1,2,4)-triazole. Current research is investigating the synthesis of 3-allyl-4-phenyl-l,2,4)-triazole. The use of 3-allyl-4-phenyl-l,2,4)-triazole in our experiments may lead to formation of the desired analog.

"""Henry Fowle Durant's vision of a college built specifically for the education of women came to fruition with the opening of Wellesley College in September, 1875. Throughout the years, perceptions of women and the ideals of women's education have changed; these developing philosophies are reflected in the varied architecture of the Wellesley campus. From concerns regarding students' health and academic potential to the changing attitudes towards social lives and the formation of societies, the landscape and architecture of Wellesley College not only create aesthetic beauty, but they also conform to common notions about women. In the 125 years since its opening, Wellesley has expanded both its educational outlook and its architecture to create a beautiful campus that maintains the integrity of Mr. Durant's original intellectual purpose.

"In her extended body of work, Emily Dickinson demonstrates an adherence to the heritage of the sublime, even though her exact location in this sublime tradition remains elusive. The poetry of Dickinson appears to testify, both stylistically and thematically, to the tradition of the masculine sublime established by Longinus. Although she in many ways fulfills the Longinian definition of the sublime, Dickinson\'s characteristic ""purification"" of language, her self-destructive internalization of the split between self and other, and her opposition to the traditional masculine sense of the sublime, demonstrate her departure from the classic text of Longinus. Further, Dickinson differs from the more self-assured masculine sublime poets, Emerson and Wordsworth, in her relentless and repetitive deconstruction of herself and her relation to power. Yet this very self-destructive element in Dickinson functions subversively: she questions and condemns herself in order to commemorate herself. For while Dickinson may not attain accolades within the tradition of the masculine sublime, she uses its form to destroy her own image and, by doing so, to dramatize her immortality. Indeed, the poetry of Emily Dickinson achieves dual sublime success: by recognizably participating in the tradition of Longinus, she remains a valid voice in the sublime tradition while she subtly changes it from within.

"A subject common to mystic religious writing, the desired/feared entry of a god into the closely human sphere (be it mental or physical) encapsulates the essence of a ""sublime experience."" Though mystical in theory, this trope has a long and venerable place in literature, from classical times onward. But what does this mean, exactly? Why is such a negative term, tantamount to \'rape,\' sometimes used to describe the ultimate in positive, religious rapture? This presentation explores the implications of the gendered sublime, at its heart sustaining a close reading of passages from Milton\'s Paradise Lost, set in the context of 18th century Sublime theorists whose ideas grew and developed out of a close familiarity with Milton\'s work.

"The contemporary poet Mary Oliver redefines ""nature poetry"" through her conception of a vibrant, complex world of interconnected natural elements. My paper will explore the human questions of Oliver\'s poetry. What does it mean to be human in the overarching natural world? How does Oliver weigh the desire to belong to nature\'s community against the sobering knowledge that to be human is, at some level, to be an outsider? How does she render her perception of the human place in the natural world, and where-and in what capacities-can a human being claim a home in such a world? I will look at the ways in which the emergence of human language, through themes of origin, birth, sex, death, and metamorphosis, creates an art of poetry that binds the human figure to the natural world.

"My thesis explores developments in serial composition after 1960 through a consideration of works by Pierre Boulez and Milton Babbitt. Serialism, a method of composition based on the ordering of compositional elements, became a unifying focus of attention for composers during the years immediately following World War II. Many composers recognized in serialism a potential to revolutionize Western musical culture. By 1965, however, serialism\'s revolutionary promise remained largely unfulfilled. Serial composers operated within a problematic cultural framework that undermined their claim to legitimacy. An ever-increasing plurality of musical influences, such as indeterminacy, improvisation, world music, and minimalism, weakened serial composers\' sense of a unified historical imperative. In addition, the growing prestige of popular music led many to question traditional hierarchies of popular and elite, jeopardizing this critical distinction in avant-garde theory. Widespread disillusionment with Cold War politics gradually replaced much of the post-war ""ground zero"" cultural optimism of the 1950s, which had fueled the serial revival. My thesis addresses how serial composers pursued a civic engagement in this environment and how this engagement shaped the development of their serial thought. I ultimately seek to demonstrate that even those idioms that seem most private and adamantine may, in fact, yield substantial public meaning. '"
"This project explores the process of adapting Shakespeare\'s plays for film. Recently, directors use soundtracks, stars, political analogies, and allusions to film genres when translating the playwright\'s text onto the silver screen. Some critics may feel this eagerness to popularize Shakespeare\'s plays may actually veer away from the true literary spirit of the playwright. On the other hand, film proves to be the best medium by which to slough off the academic stuffiness associated with Shakespeare and expose or even rejuvenate his mass appeal. After all, Peter Brook did say that ""if you extract the mental impression made by Shakespearean strategy of images, you would get a piece of pop collage ... "" Basically, I argue that such popular, modern analogies and styles used by film directors are necessary in maintaining Shakespeare\'s universal appeal, especially in an age when the common aesthetic sense is being changed drastically by technology and consumer culture.'"

"Impostors believe that their success is due to charm, luck, or error. They fear being discovered as ""frauds"" and try to hide their true selves. This study focuses on how impostor feelings affect interpersonal communication, specifically voice and self-disclosure. Voice is the willingness to present one\'s opinions and beliefs, and self-disclosure is the willingness to share personal information about the self. Participants filled out measures of their levels of voice, self-concept clarity, and the impostor phenomenon. Then they did self-disclosure activities, with either a peer or authority figure as their audience. Finally, they answered questions about how much they felt they had disclosed and how authentic they felt in their responses. People with high impostor feelings were expected to exhibit lower levels of voice and self-disclosure and to feel less authentic in their responses.'"
"The Taming of the Shrew as a text challenges its reader to see beyond its inherent sexism and misogyny. As a director at the Shakespeare Society, I wanted to bring the play to the Wellesley campus in a way that framed Shakespeare\'s story in a new light. I decided to use sociologist Charles Horton Cooley\'s concept of the ""looking\xc2\xadglass self"" as the interpretive framework for this production. His theory suggests that your sense of self is constructed not only by how you see yourself, but also by how others see you and by your perception of how others see you. During the rehearsal process, I worked to incorporate the theme of the looking-glass self in everything from the set, to the blocking, to the way the actors interpreted their characters. After the play was performed, I combined all the elements of the process: my research on Cooley and the play itself, the rehearsal process, and the performances, into a final paper which was inscribed on a zip disk using digitized video clips from a taped performance of the play to illustrate the themes.'"

"Linguistic conflict between Dutch-speaking Flemings and French-speaking Walloons has been construed as the catalyst of Flemish nationalism. However, the language conflict in the Belgian context, while significant, must be understood as one of many factors involved in a much larger process. The threat of cultural domination, social inequality, economic competition, and territorial expansion were the predominant mobilizing forces of Flemish national and ethnic identity. It was around a shared language that this conception of identity coalesced, in essence transforming ""a linguistic prise de conscience into an ethnic we-feeling"" (R.E.M. Irving, The Flemings and Walloons of Belgium). An examination of the evolution of the Flemish movement in Belgium from 1788 reveals the dynamic, diachronic nature of the process that constructs ethnic identity and national consciousness. It also demonstrates how language functions as a meaningful symbol with the ""capacity for generating imagined communities, building in effect particular solidarities"" (Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities).

"""Italian Jews and French, Greek, and Croatian Jews residing in Italian zones of occupation experienced a unique situation during World War II. In 1938, the Fascist government passed their version of anti\xc2\xadSemitic Racial Laws. Mussolini's government passed these laws without any pressure from Hitler. Italians did not actively protest these laws, yet they devised various methods to mitigate the harsh effects of this horrific legislation. Italian Jews were subject to laws that made them second-class citizens, yet they did not face the danger of deportations until German occupation in 1943. However, the Italians did actively protest anti-Semitic legislation in the occupied zones of France, Greece, and Croatia. This research addresses the question as to why Italians did not resist similar legislation within their own country, yet when this anti-Semitic legislation was transported and the danger of German deportation was heightened, these same Italians not only protected their own Jewish countrymen, but they also helped foreign Jews in their zones of occupation.

"""Cyanobacteria make up the largest group of photosynthetic prokaryotes. Cyanobacteria have existed for at least 2.5 billion years and have survived by evolving through the changing times. It has been speculated that one of the reasons for this amazing survival is due to cyanobacteria's ability to store materials needed for their existence.

"Cyanobacteria produce polyphosphate when they are starved for sulfur, in the presence of excess phosphate. In order to determine if any other inhibitor of protein synthesis would also increase the amount of polyphosphate within the cells, the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, was grown in the presence of two different protein synthesis inhibitors. The inhibitors used were Rifampcin and Chlortetracycline, which inhibit the transcription and translation of RNA, respectively, in Gram negative bacteria. Several different concentrations of each inhibitor are being tested in hopes of finding the concentration that would make the cyanobacterium enter stationary phase at a faster rate than normal. Once the correct concentrations are found, both for Rifampcin and Chlortetracycline, the cells will be grown to a high concentration and NMR spectroscopy will be used to determine the presence or absence of polyphosphate in these cultures.

"Cyanobacteria produce a nitrogen storage molecule, cyanophycin, under different stresses other than nitrogen starvation. The concentration of cyanophycin was followed when cyanobacteria were grown under the stress of low light and later moved to no stress conditions. lSN was added to the media when the cells were stressed to observe whether the nitrogen incorporated into cyanophycin was from the media (lSN) or from proteins degraded in the cell (14N). The differences between lSN and 14N were observed using proton NMR spectroscopy and showed that the cyanobacteria incorporate nitrogen into cyanophycin from both the media and degraded proteins. It was also observed that the concentration of cyanophycin could be followed using NMR spectroscopy instead of the previously used chemical assays.

"""When carrying out research on the effect of environmental stress on cell growth, it often becomes necessary to measure their growth using various analyses, including optical density, dry cell weight, and cell concentration. Our purpose in these experiments is to quantify these growth measurements and to find a numerical relationship between these parameters. Through our results we hope to be able to take a single measurement and use it to calculate the values of the other parameters. We intend to quantify these relationships for cells grown in normal, stress-free environments, as well as for cells grown in high/low light and high/low pH.

"Cyanobacteria thrive in medium around pH 8. In this project, experiments were performed in order to study how the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6308 responds to acid stress ranging from pH 6-1. Cell growth, pigmentation, increase in supernatant pH and granule formation by acid shocked cells were studied. These experiments indicate that cyanobacteria respond in a number of physiological ways when exposed to acidic pH stress. (Research supported by the Beckman Scholars Program) '"
"Cyanobacteria store nitrogen in the form of a polymer called cyanophycin granule polypeptide (cyanophycin). Cyanophycin, produced by the cell in times of environmental stress, is degraded under conditions of nitrogen starvation, as nitrogen stored in the polymer becomes required for crucial metabolic processes. Cyanophycin production is then resumed upon reintroduction of nitrogen to the cells. To determine whether degraded, intracellular proteins or extracellular media provided the nitrogen for cyanophycin, intracellular proteins were labeled with ""N while extracellular media was labeled with ""N. \'H NMR spectroscopy was used to distinguish between cyanophycin composed of ""N and cyanophycin composed of ""N. Studies to date have found cyanophycin molecules with ""N and ""N 45 minutes after reintroduction of nitrogen to starved cells.

Heat shock was induced by transferring the cells from 35\xc2\xb0 C to 45\xc2\xb0C for 30 minutes and 50 minutes. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed at least two putative heat shock polypeptides, a basic one at 30 kDa and an acidic one at 3 kDa.

This research examined the feasibility of relating the Off content of igneous allanite to the water content of the melt from which it crystallized. An experimental framework was established to determine fH2 (effective partial pressure of hydrogen) of the sample as a function of ferric/ferrous iron content and temperature at the time of crystallization. By estimating f02 independently, the activity product of water can be derived and the water content of the melt then determined. The evidence also suggests that REE incorporation into the allanite crystal structure is controlled by the iron-oxy substitution mechanism. Such work could lead to the development of a geohygrometer and increase understanding of volatiles in melts and mechanisms of volcanism.

"""Over the past year I have had the unique opportunity to work with Dr. Bauer and study Hubble Space Telescope observations of the eclipsing binary star system VV Cephei. A series of fourteen observations of the red-supergiant-hot dwarf binary star system were obtained by the STIS (Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph) between November 1997 (during totality) and December 1998 (during egress). During an independent study in spring of 1999, I developed computer programs to measure the continuum trends within the system's complex and varying ultraviolet spectrum. During the fall of 1999, l continued my study by writing programs to monitor the emission features and the changes in their radial-velocities and line strengths. Further analysis of these observations will hopefully yield a better understanding of VV Cephei, specifically information about atmosphere and mass loss of the primary star, and the distribution of matter being accreted onto the disk of the companion star.

"The nature of galactic dark matter is one of the big questions still left to be answered in astronomy. Luminous matter alone cannot explain the flat rotation curves in galaxies; thus nonluminous matter in the galactic halo is believed to exist. Candidates for this dark matter are WIMPs (weakly interactive massive particles) and MACHOs (massive compact halo objects). The purpose of this project is to search for MACHOs in a one square degree field in Sextans, by looking for motions of stars in the galactic halo with respect to the stars in the disk and galaxies in the background. We are comparing two sets of data, taken ten years apart, and so far have analyzed a subset of the data.

"""The trouble is I have plenty to say. Not only that, but I am bound to say it."" (From Jean Rhys\'s unfinished autobiography, Smile, Please, p.133) Classified as a modern British novelist, but recognized as a West Indian writer, Jean Rhys hands her reader much more than, as Ford Madox Ford quotes, ""the Antilles with its sea and sky."" Through her writing, Rhys introduces a new voice, arising from the post\xc2\xademancipation through the new plantocracy era, that challenges past and current theories on colonial, postcolonial, and modern literature. That new voice comes from the ""out-caste"" white Creole woman. Not English white and not West Indian black, they exist caught in between, uncertain of their history, nationality, and identity. Rhys, then, questions whether previous boundaries can continue to definitely ""place"" these uniquely situated women. In her two distinct yet parallel novels, Voyage in the Dark and Wide Sargasso Sea, written thirty-two years later, Jean Rhys has written what she felt ""bound to say"" about her West Indian home through the lips of the white Creole woman.

While this novel has made appearances in numerous scholarly bibliographies and literary criticisms, her other novels are rarely taught or written about. Her first novel, Jonah's Gourd Vine, shares thematic elements with Their Eyes Were Watching God that demonstrate Hurston's development as a novelist in her portrayal of Janie and John Buddy. Through their progression, Hurston suggests much about the restrictive and judgmental nature of the Black community. Similarly, Moses, Man of the Mountain, continues these themes and rewrites the Biblical Hebrew nation as Black America in the post-slavery era. Through the character of Moses, Hurston continues the story of a great leader that she began in Jonah's Gourd Vine and the quest for identity within Their Eyes Were Watching God.

"""In my thesis, I examine the concept of man's possession of free will and his subsequent moral accountability for his actions as explored by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. and his one-time prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, John Irving. Both authors return to this theme again and again in their respective bodies of work, each with a recurrent thematic approach. While Vonnegut applies the metaphor of man as a machine, Irving suggests that man is, instead, essentially animal. The repercussions this holds for man's free will, or lack of it, are explored in many contexts by both authors. The spheres, war and religion, provide heightened contexts in which each author explores the potential for ownership of action. Each tries to reconcile his ideas about volition with man's capacity for weakness and greatness, Jove and brutality, good and evil. Also important to my thesis is the degree to which each author is able to export his world view to the reader and what the reader takes from the novels about himself and mankind. My work draws from philosophy and religious texts as can illuminate these two examples of the contemporary novelist. At the Ruhlman Conference, I will be speaking specifically about the comparisons and contrasts that can be drawn between Vonnegut's use of machines and Irving's use of animals in his early novels to illustrate man's failure to achieve a higher state of being. I will be drawing not only from my own writings on the subject but from Irving's personal response to my work. I will be reading from chapters three and four of my thesis. """
"""My study concerns the underlying role of ecriture, or the act of writing, in Assia Djebar's autobiographical fiction and, more specifically, the narration of these works. Several issues are to be considered: post-colonial writing, women's voices, and critical approaches to reading Algerian literature. Most writing in French by Algerians is in some part taken as a response to European perspectives, with or without the author's intention. In Djebar's case, the danger of such an analysis is a factor because she deliberately incorporates Western perceptions into her writing. In fact, her narrators seem to reinforce certain ideas that are typically Western regarding the Oriental woman. I will examine Djebar's strategic use of several perspectives, including the Occidental, that create tension, and end up questioning their validity. This tension characterizes the texts, and the seemingly paradoxal narrative draws the reader to actively engage in creating a credible discourse."""
"Our present day notion of Englishness is defined by, among other things, the sense of a rigid social class system, tea and crumpets, refined accents, and great country houses. This image, however, fails to account for the demographic, ideological, and cultural changes resulting from two devastating global wars and a decline of the British empire during the past century. Such disruptions have caused a restructuring of classes and the mobility between them, but such changes are not often recognized by the public. In my paper, I explore the depiction of social class mobility in twentieth-century England, as evidenced through the use of language and the description of landscape in contemporary British fiction. Specifically, my analysis focuses on three works: E.M. Forster\'s Howards End, Kazuo lshiguro\'s The Remains of the Day, and Hanif Kureishi\'s Buddha of Suburbia. I study the ways in which speech acts as one of the most obvious markers of social class in literature, and the subsequent social rules that govern speech propriety within and between the classes. My research includes a study of the characters in these novels and their language use in relation to their physical location as well as how they use language to speak about the English landscape. I also discuss the role of the great English country house, and how its acquisition and its cultural associations have determined who is considered and permitted to define the notion of Englishness. Finally, I ask how ethnic hybridity is depicted in the characters of these works and how the ethnicity of the writers themselves determines the measure of ""Englishness"" of their novels.'"

"""Why is it in America that a love scene between two men often warrants an R or even NC-17 rating while a mercilessly violent film can sometimes pass with a rating of PG-13? In different cultures, social mores dictate limits of acceptable sexuality. Cinema challenges such limits. By examining similar themes (homoeroticism, infidelity, obsession, prostitution, etc.) in films from various countries, we can see how cultures differ in their idea of what is depraved, deviant, unfit for viewing, and what is an artistic representation of human sexuality. This topic, by nature of its explicitness, gets right to the heart of a nation's values, not only in its regard to sex, but to a whole host of social, political, and moral issues.

"""Witnessing domestic violence and/or community violence has negative effects on children, including externalizing (aggressive) and internalizing (anxious) behaviors and the development of psychopathology.

However, this issue of reporting discrepancy has not been the focus of any study on the impact of domestic violence on children. The present study attempted to address that issue. Discrepancies between parents' and children's reports of partner violence were studied, and an examination of whether such discrepancies are associated with children's lowered functioning, specifically in terms of their anxiety, was conducted.

The medium of the poster was developed in post-Revolutionary Cuba to act as a critical means of communication between revolutionary institutions and the Cuban people. Examples of revolutionary poster production are analyzed as tools for the expression of Cuban political and cultural policies during three phases: 1959- 62, the formative period for revolutionary institutions, characterized by the search for a distinctive graphic language; 1963- 66, when the poster movement evolved to include the participation of painters and more interconnections between political and cultural designs; and 1967-71, the period of greatest effervescence of poster production, inspired by nationalist and internationalist trends in art and policy. The study of this thematically and stylistically diverse cultural production demonstrates the independent character of the Cuban Revolution between 1959 and 1971, as leaders sought a unique path to the achievement of socialist goals.

Through a historical, economic, and social analysis of Korea's education system, this question and others are investigated. Issues such as the disparity between urban and suburban provinces and the influence of Confucian values of collectivism and loyalty will be also discussed. Observations in Korea's public schools, interviews with Korean schoolteachers, administrators, and parents help provide a more insightful perspective into Korea's present educational success and questions surrounding its future.

"""Religion in the schools is one of the most contentious issues in American education. The First Amendment guarantees that the government will not create an established church and prohibits the government from enacting laws that impinge on any individual's practice of religion. Many of the controversies surrounding religion in the schools have found their way into the courtroom, and laws and court decisions have come to shape the patterns of the school day. I will examine significant legal cases that have defined the contours of the law on issues involving religion in the schools and summarize case law in the major areas of controversy. The bulk of my research will then focus on the latest development of controversy: public support for church-affiliated schools through voucher and school choice initiatives. I will present case studies of the two largest existing voucher programs in Cleveland and Milwaukee. """
"""Over the past few years, charter schools \xc2\xad public schools that are run by community groups, nongovernmental organizations/ nonprofit organizations, and for-profit groups through a contract or charter with the local or state government-have emerged as a hot topic in education policy debates. Progressives support them because they give power and opportunity to teachers, communities, and populations who aren't well-served by existing schools. Conservatives see them as a much-needed type of school choice and competition. Critics worry that they drain funds from preexisting, struggling public schools and integrationists are concerned about schools that cater to a particular community or sex. Ideologies and theories abound in literature about charter schools, but empirical research has been limited. How are charter schools funded? Whom do they serve? Do they represent an efficient and equitable approach to public school finance? Join a critical dialogue on these complex, important questions about the direction of American public education. """
"""This past January, six Wellesley students journeyed to Shanghai for two weeks and witnessed firsthand the changing face of modern day China. From the sights they saw and the people they met, these four seniors and two juniors gained a new appreciation for the dynamic city and for China as well. Based on their experiences, this presentation will discuss how their perceptions of China were altered after the eye-opening trip and how their views may reflect the way many Americans currently regard the country. Topics to be presented include the architecture of Shanghai, food, religion, and shopping, in addition to the Chinese's own views on Americans."""
"The body undergoes constant attack from the environment that threatens its wellbeing. Over time, the body has developed a complex immune system, which provides protection against foreign pathogens and agents. However, certain conditions can cause this system to turn against itself, creating an immune disorder with usually debilitating consequences. Disorders, including stress and immunity, asthma, AIDS, arthritis, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and transplant rejection will be discussed. Our focus will be on the current research being performed to characterize the symptoms, to pinpoint causative agents, and to develop potential treatments for these immune disorders. This research was conducted independently and synthesized over the course of the BISC 314 Immunology class. '"
"Given a set of data points, how do you determine which points fall into clusters (that is, groups of points that are close together, implying relatedness)? This problem, known as clustering, frequently arises in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In this talk, I describe an example of an application for clustering, as well as one previous algorithm to solve this problem. Then I explain each step of the algorithm, and finally, show that it produces accurate results and runs in time linear in the size of the data set. (Research supported by an NSF REU grant) '"
"Children frequently tell stories and role\xc2\xadplay. As with most forms of play, these activities form a large part in child development, from acquiring and practicing language skills to better understanding themselves and preparing for future roles. Children have always been attracted to plush toys because they are anthropomorphic, but cuddly. This makes the stuffed animal a natural story-evoking interface. My thesis is to build an interactive plush toy that encourages storytelling in children by letting them create characters with stories for the toy. Children record a script for their toy\'s character and a set of stories that the toy ""knows."" They can then interact with the toy, which plays the first part of the script and waits for a response, then returns with the next scripted statement. It finally asks the child for a story and returns the most relevant story from the set of stories that the toy ""knows."" (Research supported by MIT Media Lab) '"
"The calculation of the FIRST and FOLLOW sets are central in the development of any compiler, and they are extensively studied in every course that discusses the issues related to compiler construction. Calculating these sets for the symbols of a grammar is typically the first step in the development of parsers, both bottom-up and top-down. Algorithms for calculating them are known since the 1960s. Even though these algorithms are easy for a computer to execute, it is rather difficult for humans, including students, to understand, visualize, and follow. We believe that we can improve the situation with the help of a graph theoretical approach which we introduce in our project. The algorithms we present have the advantage of being derived directly from the definition of the FIRST and FOLLOW sets, simplifying their conceptual complexity. Moreover, the graphs make it straightforward to answer questions like ""why x appears on the FOLLOW set of y"" which would be difficult using the traditional algorithms. The animation and visualization package we are currently implementing in Java is expected to further help the understanding of these concepts. '"

"""The olfactory structures of vertebrate and invertebrate species are separated into distinct clumps of neuropil called glomeruJi where chemosensory neurons carrying information about the environment synapse with second order neurons. We have shown in the decapod crustaceans that the number of glomeruli within the olfactory lobe is characteristic for each species but varies widely between species, and that phylogenetic factors influence the numbers of glomeruli. We are now testing whether an organism's lifestyle is correlated with the size and number of olfactory glomeruli in closely related species that have divergent lifestyles: genetically blinded vs. sighted crayfish, and crayfish living in fast-moving streams vs. stagnant waters. These will define whether differences in olfactory needs correlate with differences in the structure of the olfactory centers. This would be expected if evolutionary pressures have selected for increased glomerular numbers in those species where a more elaborate olfactory sense would have provided a selective advantage. """

"Induction of microgyria to the cerebral cortex of rats mimics anomalies exhibited in dyslexic brains. Microgyria may be induced by surgery at early infancy and subsequently results in later behavior deficits involving auditory processing. These deficits in audition are congruent to processing deficits also observed in dyslexic children. Previous studies have examined the effects of lesions to the parietal, frontal, and occipital cortices on the MGN (the main auditory relay station of the thalamus) of animals. This study includes temporally lesioned animals in the experiment. Animals were lesioned with a freezing probe and microgyria were induced in all four cortices. Sham animals received surgery with no freezing probe and were employed as controls. Differences in cell size, as a function of lesioning, between sexes are expected, as indicated in previous studies. Caudal lesions to the brains may produce more significant effects than rostral lesions.'"
"Nitrous oxide (N20) has been used successfully in treating post-withdrawal craving in alcoholic humans, aiding in their continued abstinence. We sought to establish an appropriate animal model to study the effectiveness of N20 induced drinking suppression. Rats underwent a limited access condition; one hour each day they had access to either water or ethanol. The highest alcohol-consuming rats were selected from each strain and exposed for various durations to a N20 mixture or pure oxygen. These exposures occurred every four days, scheduled to end one hour before a limited access condition. Consistent with earlier results, exposure to N20 suppressed alcohol consumption in rats in a dose-dependent manner. This result confirms the effectiveness of N20 in selectively suppressing alcohol drinking, establishing a rat model appropriate for use in studying the basic mechanisms underlying this effect.

"Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical associated with synaptogenesis, neuronal refinement, and cell death during development in a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species. A previous study on lobsters showed the presence of an enzyme that produces nitric oxide, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), in specific brain regions during larval life of Homarus americanus. We are focusing specifically on the role of NO in synaptogenesis in the accessory and olfactory lobes in developing lobsters. We are asking whether the period of glomerular formation, which we believe is correlated with synaptogenesis, coincides with the time when NO labeling is seen. Brains and nerve cords from embryos and all larval stages were labeled for NOS and examined. Preliminary results suggest that NOS labeling does occur at the predicted times of synaptogenesis. '"
"Herman Melville\'s novel Moby-Dick and his short story ""Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall-Street"" share certain themes important to Melville that provide insight into his profound psychology. Ahab from Moby-Dick and Bartleby are staunch in their ways of living and in their refusal to accommodate others. While both characters are distinct individuals within their context and in comparison to each other, they share traits with Melville himself, such as the desire for self-assertion. Melville enjoyed early success in his literary career with his travel romances, but then faced commercial failure with the later novels, above all Moby-Dick, that brimmed with larger, more abstract, and elusive ideas. ""Bartleby, the Scrivener"" is Melville\'s response to the failures of his most ambitious books and his assertion to his reading public that he ""prefers not to"" write the popular travel romances but works that are driven by his inner voice or higher power.

"""While a person's upbringing shapes his character and his world view, his adult experiences also shape his memories of childhood. Two nineteenth-century texts which draw on the protagonist's memories in this way are Francois Rene de Chateaubriand's Memoires d'outre-tombe (1848-50) and Ivan Goncharov's Oblomov (1859). In each work the writer creates an idyllic vision of childhood that contains both autobiographical and fictional elements. The early years of both protagonists are characterized by an isolation from society on a remote country estate, a desire to commune with nature, and a sense of timeless continuity. Despite these similarities, the boys' family relationships prepare them differently for adult life; Chateaubriand's sense of alienation from his parents prepares him for the harsh realities of the world, while the overprotection Oblomov receives from his family prevents him from fitting into society as an adult. Both men come of age in worlds marked by upheaval and change, Chateaubriand in post\xc2\xadRevolutionary France and Oblomov in Russia after the Decembrist Uprising. It is the early lives of Chateaubriand and Oblomov that determine how they deal with those changes and interact with the world around them. """
"""During the 1920's there was a group of writers in Japan known as the Shinkankakuha (Neo-Sensationalist Group) spearheaded by the young writer Yokomitsu Riichi. This group of writers, influenced by the emergence of film as a new form of media, attempted to create stories that used scenic, camera-like shots and descriptive characterizations rather than a first person narrative to make the text come alive for the reader. Although Yokomitsu is best known for his innovative literature, the theories of the Shinkankakuha group are best represented by Kinugasa Teinosuke's 1926 film, Kurutta Ippeiji (A Page of Madness) in which they collaborated. Throughout this film, the camera works with a disjointed narrative to thread the film together without relying on spoken language. An analysis of the film reveals many similarities with the surrealist films of Europe, such as those of Bunuel."""
"""How are we to understand the profusion of women in Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (1981) and their apparently marginal role in the imagined nation? Several scholars have noted Rushdie's attempt to write India, or narrate nation, in terms that render his narratives curiously misogynistic. By identifying specifically Indian and gendered idioms at work in the novel, I find that Rushdie's production of masculinity is far from secure and indeed rests on a pervasive male anxiety about female power. The politics and the aesthetics of that masculinity are mediated by feminine tropes - of maya (the principle of illusion) and mata (the figure of the mother). Midnight's Children, then, reveals a complicated negotiation of nationhood and national subjectivity that is made possible by and through women.

Mistry confronts this reality by the character of Beggarmaster, a terrifying man who without remorse collects and mutilates people for his trade.

"""In recent years, scholars have used the term qingyu juexing (sexual awakening) to describe the philosophical atmosphere of China's penultimate dynasty. This description counters the general belief that China, despite its huge population, has always been an asexual, anti-erotic society.

They occupy prominent positions in the mythology of many different cultures. And today, even with our modern eyes, they maintain some of their mystery and power. It is difficult for us to see a crow or a raven as a bird and nothing more. We do not view them passively; instead, they provoke an immediate emotional response. This reaction is rooted in our cultural history, in our personal history, and colors our perception of them. This same subjectivity also filters our view of the world around us. Crows and ravens are simply an illustration of this reality. They allow for an exploration of the subjectivity of perception through a body of artwork.'"

"This series of bronzes and prints explores patterns of growth and change in the natural world and in the industrialized world. Order and chaos appear and disappear in great harmony all around us and within us - such as in the things we cannot create sprouting up from the ground, the proportions and operations of our own bodies, and the structures we build imitating the natural world. Patterns and systemized growth cultivate the organic, explaining, yet still confounding, the rhyme and reason behind nature. All around us there is pure chaos in how the world grows and changes, but looking further there is a perfect order underneath - sustaining the spiral, the geometry, and the dynamism of change. Time keeps the rhythm within this series, within how we understand the world, in an endless cyclic movement and concurrently in a unified cosmic whole.

"My project is an autobiographical multimedia introspective examining past and present emotions regarding experiences in the hospital - both as the sibling of a terminally ill child, as the daughter of parents who have a terminally ill son and as the bone marrow donor who silently saved his life. My art addresses the intense emotions and pain associated with all aspects of the ordeal, including personal reflections as well as general expressions for the countless others who have been, and are now in this situation. I have searched for a way to honestly and appropriately convey my feelings and after much exploration, frustration, and uncertainty have now entered into the production of paper prayers. This symbolic format, used on World AIDS Day in the Boston area, and found traditionally in Buddhist prayer flags, allows me to incorporate emotional associations related to these incarnations of the prayers into my work, such as faith, acknowledgment of disease, support, and love. The exploration of different methods of expression through composition and a wide range of materials in my paper prayers, combined with an interactive installation involving the same themes, will synthesize and make sense of the myriad feelings regarding my own experience.

"During recent years, interest in the processes and effects of international educational exchanges has been growing tremendously. Part of this increase in interest is due to the fact that participation in educational exchange programs has risen to an all-time high of almost 100,000 American students studying abroad in the 1996/1997 school year. With more Americans going abroad than ever before, and with a corresponding increase in foreign students entering the United States, the importance of ensuring the success of educational exchange programs cannot be understated. However, there seems to be a growing consensus among educators and researchers that these programs are not accomplishing their intended goal(s). One way of evaluating whether or not students will experience a high level of immersion, and whether or not study-abroad programs are accomplishing their goals, is by measuring the correlation between personality traits and level of immersion.

Overall, students with high mathematics anxiety were found to have performed less well on standardized mathematics exams than students with low anxiety. Math-anxious Wellesley students also appeared to be avoiding the study of mathematics when possible. Finally, an internal locus of control for success was found to be associated with lower mathematics anxiety and higher performance. """

Spoken word poetry is where emotion and language combine and form art. Is it still art when imagery and technology are used to bring the poetry into electronic life? In MURDerER the words of the author were brought to life through my artistic interpretation. I have thus gained power, for the life the poem has now is defined by me.

"""In the history of the Olympic games the countries that have ranked highest, according to the number of medals they have won, are those that are economically developed and powerful. Data show that, while in the early Olympics (e.g. London, 1908) over 90 percent of the participant countries won medals, in recent ones (e.g. Seoul, 1988) only 30 percent win. This paper asks how the distribution of medals has changed as the number of participating countries has grown, using economic variables to explain a country's decision to participate in the games and its chances of winning medals. It also addresses the importance of the home-country bias on the outcome of competition and how that influences rent-seeking behavior when host cities are chosen.

The purpose of this study was to understand the relationships between the lake, the petrochemical industry, and the general community regarding water pollution and its environmental impacts. Interviews with industry officials, community members, scientists, environmental educators, and park rangers revealed a spectrum of opinion on the sources and degree of pollution of the Jake and about the company that owns the complex, and pointed to a general lack of communication and trust between groups.

Through the Center for Wildlife Management, a follow-up study was administered to assess the current stocking rate, determine the sustainable levels of the Reserve's resources, and make recommendations for the future management of the Reserve.

"""Professor Guo Li of the Heilongjiang Province Women's Research Institute Harbin, China As part of my course work in Harbin, I designed a one-on-one tutorial on Contemporary Women's Issues in China. My professor works at the Heilongjiang Province Women's Research Institute. Through our time together, we established a close friendship. She introduced me not only to the many problems that women face, but also to a variety of other contemporary social problems such as health care, education, child welfare, unemployment, and the environment. I also learned about many differences between rural and urban China with respect to these issues. My professor provided me with amazing opportunities to talk with Chinese people working in law and psychology. I also met an editor of a popular women's magazine. On one occasion, I went to an office affiliated with the United Nations, at which I interviewed women who had come that day from homes in the countryside to Harbin in search of work. Given that the class was taught entirely in Chinese, I made incredible progress with my language through discussing these complex issues. At the end of my term, I wrote a research paper in Chinese characters and gave a 15 minute oral presentation in Chinese to teachers and students about my paper. Since we covered so much material in the tutorial, I focused my final paper and presentation on marriage law and the one child policy. """
"Whether born in Puerto Rico or Mexico, Argentina or the United States, all Latinos are unified in a shared history and language. What is so amazing is that regardless of the collective culture, a clear sense of individuality remains. To share a common culture is not to claim a common identity. In this project, I examine personal perceptions of Latino identity within the Wellesley community. Drawing from interviews of diverse Latina Wellesley women, I have formed a panel of selected interviewees. Their narratives are the basis for the discussions that will provide a deeper insight of what the Latina identity is, and how that identity lives and evolves at Wellesley College.'"
"The overall goal of this study is to elicit protective immunity against retroviral infection via intravenous injections of immature dendritic cells (DCs) expressing a DNA vaccine using a mouse model system. DCs, which represent a class of powerful professional antigen-presenting cells, are believed to be central in the initiation of immune responses after the administration of a DNA vaccine. It is speculated that immature DCs infected with a DNA vaccine encoding a particular viral antigen will increase overall antigen presentation and generate intense humoral and cell\xc2\xadmediated immune responses. It is thus the aim of this project to achieve full protection against the Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV) in mice by administering immature DCs expressing either env or gag-pol genes by adoptive transfer prior to virus challenge. Cellular and humoral immune responses will be evaluated. (Funded by Staley Cancer Research Grants) '"
"Cancer can result from uncontrolled cell growth. The Wnt pathway, involving many intracellular proteins, may play an important role in regulating gene transcription. This project focused on developing efficient methods for analyzing the Wnt pathway and its related proteins. Activation of the Wnt pathway causes an accumulation of a cytoplasmic protein, t?,\xc2\xadcatenin, resulting in the activation of the nuclear transcription factor, TCF. This cascade turns on transcription of a cell cycle gene, which may result in uncontrolled cell proliferation. The first approach was to create fusion proteins of t?,-catenin and TCF with a viral protein. These constructs were transfected into a mammalian cell line and assayed using Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. The second approach utilized the estrogen receptor hormone-binding domain (HBD), which can be selectively activated by estrogen. Future experiments will involve the fusion of t?,-catenin and TCF to HBO and will test function by selectively inducing protein activity. (This research was done at the UCSF Cancer Center) '"
"An individual grows by cell proliferation. Subsequently, cells differentiate into discrete cell types. When a cell loses its ability to stop proliferation, it can become cancerous. My research focuses on the stability of E protein. E proteins are factors that play an important role in cell division and differentiation. To investigate E protein stability, a region of the protein was altered to create an area of negative charge, which mimics phosphorylation. The effect of the mutation was tested in proliferating and differentiating cells. Using immunofluorescent microscopy, 1 saw that the phosphorylated-like mutant E protein prevents differentiation. This result suggests that protein stability and phosphorylation are related to the role of E protein in cell cycle regulation. (Research supported by Alvan T. and Viola D.

"The Beer-Lambert Law states that the absorbance of a solution should be linearly dependent on the concentration of the absorbing species. However, the uranyl ion (UO/+) in dilute acidic media does not obey this law between 350 and 400nm, although it does so at higher wavelengths. It is unprecedented to have a system that obeys this relationship in some regions of the spectrum but not in others. The uranyl ion also displays anomalies in the emission quantum yield. Assuming that relaxation from upper excited states to the emitting level is essentially 100% efficient, the emission quantum yield should be independent of the excitation wavelength. The relative emission quantum yield of the uranyl ion is wavelength dependent, with a 50% decrease in the quantum yield in the region 350-400nm. The Beer-Lambert Law violation can be explained with a model that involves dimer formation by uranyl ions. The quantum yield behavior is consistent with a multiple excited state model, where high-energy states relax directly to the ground state by non-radiative means. Our focus is on combining these models to develop a single mathematical and chemical model to explain all of our observations. '"
"""One of the most serious threats facing our planet, and the creatures that inhabit it, is the continued direct and indirect destruction of its environment by the introduction of a wide variety of pollutants. One group of these pollutants, often collectively referred to as heavy metals, can be toxic to all forms of life, and includes lead, mercury, nickel, copper, cobalt, cadmium, and zinc. This study's goal, conducted as a part of BISC 317, was to investigate copper phytotoxicity in the aquatic plant, water hyacinth. Specifically, we focused on the effects of toxic concentrations of copper on the biochemistry, physiology, and microscopic anatomy of leaf cells. We believe that a clear understanding at the molecular level of how plants cope with heavy metal (copper) stress may contribute to a general understanding of how all organisms, including humans, deal with environmental stresses and are damaged by heavy metal poisoning."""
"Drugs called beta blockers compete with adrenaline for beta receptor found in lungs and hearts, and interfere with the action of adrenaline, helping to reduce the symptoms connected with various disorders including stage fright. In previous experiments, it was seen that an injury response occurred when male rats were exposed to continuous propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. A more specific drug, ICI 118,551, was used to test the effects of the beta-2-adrenergic blocking response that the drug caused within the lungs of rats. I examined the lung tissue of male rats through electron microscopy after exposure of two to three hours to the drug and the control group exposed to saline. From the images obtained from the electron microscope, we observed similar effects to those previously demonstrated in the propranolol\xc2\xadtreated group, such as thickening of the connective tissue, increased number of Type II cells, and possible endothelial cell apoptosis.

"Cyanobacteria are blue-green algae that contain a nitrogen storage molecule called cyanophycin (which is known as cyanophycin granule polypeptide, or CGP, in its insoluble form). The purpose of our research is to identify proteases (enzymes that degrade other proteins) involved in the breakdown of CGP by studying the electrophoretic gels of cyanobacterial extracts. We have been using zymogram gels with casein, a protein that has been shown to be a suitable substrate for ""cyanophycinase"". We have found that cyanobacteria treated with chloramphenicol (a drug that inhibits protein but not CGP synthesis) under low light conditions contain new proteases. Cells subjected to nitrogen starvation have at least two proteases that can be inhibited by typical protease inhibitors and at least one that cannot. We are studying the conditions under which these proteases appear in order to determine the class of protease to which they belong and how they might be regulated.

"""Endopeptidase 24.15 (EP 24.15), also called thimet oligopeptidase, is an enzyme that cleaves neuropeptides to either bioactive or inactive forms. Previous studies have shown that EP 24.15 appears to be activated by calcium at millimolar concentrations. Research has shown two seemingly conflicting results as to where the calcium is binding in order to confer the observed activation. Some experiments have shown that the calcium appears to bind directly to the enzyme, while other studies indicate that the calcium binds to the enzyme's ligand (substrate or inhibitor). We can observe changes in the thermodynamic parameters of the protein in the presence and absence of calcium and the ligand through calorimetry. Through comparison of our thermodynamic and kinetic data with structural characteristics of the enzyme, we hope to gain more of an understanding of the molecular mechanism of EP 24.lS's apparent activation by calcium.

"""Endopeptidase 24.15 (EP 24.15) is an enzyme that cleaves neuropeptides to either bioactive or inactive forms. Research has indicated that the enzyme is activated by calcium ions, but it is not known whether the interaction of the metal is with ligand or directly with the enzyme. One approach to answering this question is to determine whether EP 24.lS's electrophoretic mobility changes as a result of interactions with calcium, in the presence or absence of ligand. A change in mobility would indicate a conformational change or alteration in molecular weight. Electrophoresis also yields information about aggregation of the enzyme. EP 24.15 can exist as a single subunit, as dimers or higher-order multimers. Reagents that favor formation of the monomer activate the enzyme. Results of electrophoresis in the presence and absence of calcium indicate that calcium may interrupt formation of dimers and oligomers.

"Stress is an established trigger of migraine headaches. Because the sympathetic nervous system responds to stress with increased stimulation, the interval before a migraine attack is believed to be a period of heightened sympathetic activity. Sympathetic activity will cause vasoconstriction, which lowers finger skin temperature. Finger skin was therefore hypothesized to exhibit low temperatures before a migraine attack, and the possibility of using finger skin temperature as an indicator of an upcoming migraine episode was examined. Students from Wellesley College who suffer from migraine headaches participated in the study by agreeing to have measurements of finger and body temperature, sleepiness, heart rate, and activity taken. Finger skin temperature was not found to differ significantly before and after a migraine attack, but the possibility of misdiagnoses and a too small sample size may have resulted in spurious findings.'"
"Research has demonstrated a potential link between light exposure and serotonin levels in invertebrate species, such as Aplysia. This examines the effects of light cycles on the serotonin levels in Hirudo medicinalis and Haemopis grandis. Leeches were separated into three different categories based on light exposure for seven and fourteen days. Ventral nerve cords of leeches were harvested and serotonergic cells were localized in the ganglia via immunocytochemical methods employing HRP. Qualitative results of serotonin staining were obtained in a photographic form using light microscopy. Effects of light exposure emerged upon analysis of data. Dark and random light cycles elicited decreased serotonergic response in both Hirudo and Haemopis. Noteworthy unforeseen effects of light deprivation on behavior were additionally observed. Leeches deprived of light were markedly lethargic and exhibited little swimming behavior relative to enlightened peers. Findings suggest circadian rhythms exist in the leech and are related to levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin. '"
"Vernal pools are unique seasonal freshwater bodies that are essential to the survival of many vertebrate and invertebrate species. Several species of mole salamanders (Ambystoma), the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), and the invertebrate fairy shrimp (Anostraca) are considered obligate species, which means that they depend exclusively on these wetlands for breeding and survival. Vernal pool habitats are being drastically reduced by development. Only if they are certified can these habitats be protected under the Wetlands Protection Act. Certification involves identifying and mapping the location of a vernal pool and documenting the presence of obligate and facultative species according to the guidelines of the Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program. For the past two years, eleven Wellesley College students have worked on this project which was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. By definition, vernal pools are in existence only in the springtime so most of the biological activity must be documented from early April to late May. The goals of the project were twofold. The first part involved community outreach and education, where we spoke to community groups and children in middle schools and high schools. The second component was the legal protection of the habitat of obligate species. We studied over 40 vernal pools and certified 24 in 7 towns in Massachusetts. '"

"""Harriet Beecher Stowe's endorsement of racial stereotypes in Uncle Tom's Cabin animates much of the current debate concerning the treatment of race in the American literary canon. When we place this issue in its historical context, we can perceive how Stowe's characterization reveals her conformity to abolitionist thought and furthers her own beliefs in racialism. However, by understanding stereotypes, and Stowe's adoption of them for her black characters, we can see that although Stowe intended to and somewhat succeeded in transcending the racial prejudices of her time, the pervasiveness of stereotypical characterization ultimately subverts her intentions. """
"""Stowe's own view of race relations in America was pessimistic. She could not envision a life for freed slaves in the North, and in the character of George Harris, she suggests her approval of colonization, a movement based on the belief that free blacks and whites could not live together on equal terms in the United States. George's letter at the end of Uncle Tom's Cabin, announcing his intention to go to Liberia, has become one of the more controversial aspects of the novel, and Stowe implies that emigration to Liberia is one of several options that slaves can take once they are emancipated.

"In her second antislavery novel, Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp (1856), Stowe presented a hero very different from her first, the passive, Christ-like Uncle Tom in Uncle Tom\'s Cabin (1852). Affected by the violence occurring in the United Slates during this period and the panic over slave conspiracy and insurrection which plagued the slave states, Dred is the son of famous slave conspirator Denmark Vesey. Gloomy, prophetic, and powerful, Dred is an overwhelming force in the novel about whom Stowe seems ambivalent. Although Dred is consumed by the crimes endured by his race and capable at times of ""savage fierceness""(274), Stowe demonstrates an immense sympathy and compassion for his plight, even going so far as to reconcile the two roles of God-the New Testament God, the savior, and the Old Testament God, the avenger.

"""The doctor-patient relationship could be improved significantly if the patient were given more of a voice in his or her own examination and treatment. Critics have asserted that this may be accomplished in part by viewing the illness as comparable to a literary text and the patient as the author of that text. If the physician could take the role of the reader of that work (in diagnosis), as well as coauthor (in healing), medicine could reclaim its traditional role as a healing art. In this project, 1 set out to explore medicine as an art form by comparing diagnosis with literary analysis. I examined the process of a mock diagnosis and then applied this process to the analysis of several choruses from Jack Kerouac's Mexico City Blues. Through a detailed history, followed by a physical examination of the text, I gained a new understanding of this work. This comparison of methods demonstrated itself to be helpful in viewing medicine as a healing art. """
"Both literature and medicine create human histories. The writer and the doctor put pen to hand and craft narratives in an attempt to bring certain human experiences to light. Yet often times, they both lose sight of the one object that always lies at the very heart of their work - the person. Immersed in the particulars of language and form, confined by the limits of time and situation, these storywriters concoct as best a representation of a self as they can. It is vital to consider the ways in which even such sensitive and perceptive vision may prove oblique and inadequate. What of the self itself? What kind of vision comes from within the self, and what knowledge can be gained by listening to the voices of the damned, the struggling, the mad? I wish to create a space for these voices to speak, for the stories to be told by those who live the story.

"Children\'s early relationships are important as contexts for developing language skills, exposure to cooperation and conflict, and forming an understanding of the world. Young children begin to differentiate between relationships and to develop expectations for ""social provisions"" of relationships. Social provisions are characteristics of relationships that meet an individual\'s requirements for well-being, such as companionship, nurturance, and instrumental help. Little is known about how children conceptualize relationships in terms of social provisions. Interviews of 31 three- to five-year-old children were conducted regarding the social provisions they associated with their mothers. Children were also observed in free play sessions encouraging pretense because children demonstrate their understanding of social provisions when enacting roles. Preliminary results suggest age differences in early concepts of and differentiation of the social provisions associated with relationships with mothers. '"
"""It is generally acknowledged that the relationship between a parent and young child is crucial to the child's psychological development.

This study was conducted to assess whether mutuality, as measured by the Mutual Psychological Development Questionnaire, correlates with conversation satisfaction. Correlations between mutuality, frequency of conversations, and perceptions of the child's positive emotional state were also examined. A total of 66 parents whose preschool children attended the Wellesley College Child Study Center and Cambridge Children's Associated Day Care Center participated in this study. Results indicated significant positive correlations. Furthermore, no significant differences were found in levels of mutuality between parents of different racial/ethnic backgrounds."""

"Although the presence of overtly gendered paid work is declining, women are still perceived as naturally better at housework and child care. While women are increasingly accepted in the workplace, men are less eager to increase their involvement in unpaid and undervalued housework and child care. Does the significant gender gap Arlie Hochschild found in the division of housework and child care exist among today\'s dual career couples? To what extent do current business school students consider the labor of raising children to be a factor influencing their career choices? Using data from written surveys and phone interviews, I examined whether gender affected the attitudes of current MIT Sloan students about housework and child care. I found that gender differences in housework and child care still exist in theory and in practice.

"My topic is the development of new feminist discourses by women of color in the 1970s and early 1980s in the United States. Though too often our history of feminism is white-washed, women of color virtually created new feminisms in the same time period that saw the explosion of liberal and radical White feminisms. My thesis historicizes the development of feminist consciousness among Asian-Americans, Blacks, Native Americans and Chicanas and proceeds to discuss the development of feminism grounded in differential oppositional consciousness by radical women of color. My primary sources for the development and evolution of new feminist discourses are Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga\'s This Bridge Called My Back, Gloria Anzaldua\'s Making Face Making Soul and Borderlands. These three seminal texts have become cornerstone works which have helped reconstitute feminism by redefining it around the intersubjective experiences of women of color. In building what these writers have dubbed a ""theory of the flesh,"" they disrupt the myths that power our society. The final part of my thesis consists of analyzing the performances of Spiderwoman, a collective theater group of the 1970s and 1980s made up of Native American women. My analysis will focus on the underlying myths that power their performance and their relation to the new feminisms at the beginning of the 21st century.'"
"Is Marxism translatable to a world where capitalism is not only the driving force, but also the defining characteristic? Can the egalitarian ideals of socialism be translated to practice? Coupon Socialism provides an economic scheme that combines the equality inherent in socialism and the strength derived from competition in capitalism. By creating two currencies, one for purchasing goods and another ""coupon"" currency for investing in companies, Coupon Socialism alters the economic and social experience of citizens. At a designated age, alt citizens would receive an equal number of coupons for purchasing shares in companies; this allows each citizen to enjoy benefits like those of stockholders, including votes on the board of elections and dividends, in the form of additional coupons. The analysis of Coupon Socialism will include issues of personal identity and social responsibility. '"
"The concepts of state sovereignty and international community may appear two incompatible ideals, yet a sovereign state is essential for the creation of an international community. A state begins looking outside its own boundaries only after obtaining a certain degree of political and economic stability. On the international level, Immanuel Kant and John Rawls outline the just, utopian community. Only to some extent, however, should we strive for such a community. There is danger in homogeneity and the resultant decrease in 4:30 - 5:40 competitive tension. Bombarded by the popular view for a more just society through an international community, we must not abandon the concept of sovereignty. The state, although not in its traditional, nationalistic guise as the sole sovereign power in regional conflicts, is still crucial in international levels of governance. Most importantly, as we face ever increasing talk of ""globalization,"" the state must serve as the unity preserving particular histories of peoples. '"
"""Abstractly divided into a transitional and a consolidation phase, democratization terminates into a democracy, characterized by fair, open, and regular elections, and institutions that recognize and protect the citizens' rights. However, most of the research on democratization ignores the presence of women. Recognizing that academic void, I dedicated my thesis to answer two questions: How do women participate in democratization? How does democratization affect the lives of women? I use two case studies: socialist Spain in the post-Franco years starting in 1975 and neoliberal Argentina after the Dirty War, beginning in 1982. I argue that although the Argentine women demonstrated a greater activism in the transitional phase of democratization, the Spanish women have received more benefits in the consolidation phase. I conclude that both the women's involvement and the effects of democratization on their lives depend on the social, political, and economic contexts surrounding this process. """

My empirical research includes a content analysis of popular newsmagazine articles from 1989-1998 to examine how genetic research, particularly the Human Genome Project, are represented in popular discourse. I compare these representations to those in popular scientific magazines during the same time period.

"""The growing emphasis on the United States-Mexico border has focused international attention on an area that has quickly become an important staging ground for economic, cultural, social, and political forces. The border town of El Paso, Texas is a gateway to Cuidad Juarez and the highway leading to Casas Grandes, Chihuahua and the small village of Mata Ortiz. Mata Ortiz, a village of approximately 1,500 people is currently the seat of an artistic movement, which is quickly redefining Northern Mexico's position in Mexican folk art. The impact of the border on this astounding artistic phenomenon will be explored in this paper in an attempt to illuminate the factors that contribute to an artistic movement's international success."""
"""In 1947, Taliesin apprentice David Henken located a site in Pleasantville, Westchester County, NY for a cooperative housing project. His vision was based on Frank Lloyd Wright's idea of Usonia: inexpensive, non\xc2\xadelaborate, but tasteful and functional single family homes in a community of circular one-acre plots. The Pleasantville site was deemed Usonian Homes II, with three houses designed by Wright, the majority designed by Henken, and a few designed by other architects. Usonian Homes included a dedicated group of middle-class citizens who had no formal political agenda but promoted ethnic and racial diversity and were interested in an idealistic American community. Two of the houses designed by Wright, the Friedman House, built in 1948, and the Reisley House, built in 1951, embody the idea of Usonia in different ways. The Friedman House exemplifies the individual expression of its inhabitants, while the Reisley House features both typically Usonian characteristics and components of Wright's architecture commonly seen in his larger houses. """
"From the onset of the Great Depression through the Korean War, Frank Lloyd Wright focused much creative energy on inexpensive residences which would encourage an informal style of domestic life. Borrowing Samuel Butler\'s term for the United States in his 1917 utopian novel, Erewhon, Wright coined \'Usonian\' as a housing style that would embody both his belief in suburbia as well as the changing nature of American society. Coupled with these considerations, Wright attempted to resolve the problem of ""low\xc2\xadcost housing against a background first of shortages of resources, then of rising costs."" To this end, Wright would eventually modify the Usonian style home to the \'Usonian Automatic\' which allowed for do-it-yourself construction, further reducing costs. A key example of this latter style is the Pappas House in St. Louis, Missouri. What makes this house so unique is that it was actually constructed by its owners, as Wright had intended for this style of housing. Thus, in this presentation, I will focus on the Pappas house, paying specific attention to my on-site research and firsthand interviews with the client. '"

"""Possible selves constitute an individual's realistic hopes, fears, and fantasies. This conception of self may be particularly important for college students who are considering future personal and occupational goals. Although the concept of self has traditionally been viewed as a personal construct, it is becoming increasingly clear that cultural values and attitudes contribute to identity development in important ways. In this study, the following questions were explored: What happens when the values of one's culture of family origin are inconsistent with those associated with college life? How do these inconsistencies impact the development of possible selves? To explore these questions, a survey of 50 Wellesley College students, who identified themselves as being ethnic, was conducted. Measures of possible selves, acculturative stress, and social support were analyzed. Findings will be discussed from a relational-cultural perspective. """
"Gender is a social construction that is given meaning by the complex structure of domination imposed by our society. It is a play in which we are assigned a costume and are made to perform an act that is created and recreated in time. It is an oppressive dichotomy where we are taught what it means to be either a ""man"" or a ""woman."" This project confronts the idea of gender as a binary system. Instead of portraying gender as a fixed image, this project explores the many dimensions of gender, resulting in a number of colorful, vibrant, and diverse images.'"
"""This study examined the relationship between academic performance and satisfaction and congruence of major with tested career interests. Seventy-six Wellesley students completed questionnaires measuring the above constructs. Participants' career interests were measured by John Holland's Self-Directed Search which classifies individuals according to typologies of vocational choice. He asserts that members of a vocation have similar personalities and respond to many situations and problems in similar fashion, creating what he labels a characteristic interpersonal environment. The major assumption of his theory is that vocational satisfaction, stability and achievement depend on the extent to which the individual's personality and work environment are congruent. There was a moderate positive correlation between congruence and satisfaction at Wellesley (r (54) = 0.38, p < 0.01). Participants with high congruence showed higher degree of satisfaction at Wellesley and in their majors than did those who exhibited less congruence. """
"My thesis is a study of the approximately 20 Wellesley alumnae who have made Aliyah, immigration to Israel, over the past 30-40 years. I had the opportunity to interview them on a recent trip to Israel. The questions I posed related to their multifaceted identities. I asked them to discuss the evolution of their Zionist, Jewish or non- Jewish, American and Israeli identities, as well as their identities as Wellesley women. To contextualize my study, I am also looking at the trends in North American Aliyah to ascertain whether or not Wellesley alumnae conform to this larger pattern. Their stories are both diverse and remarkable, and will be the focus of my presentation. '"

"""Luis Bufiuel and Pedro Almodovar are among the most controversial Spanish movie directors of their generations. Fifty years stand between each director's first movie, Un chien andalou (1928) and Pepi, Luci, Bom, y otras chicas del mont6n (1978); yet, they share a quest in the search for liberty and new aesthetic and intellectual frontiers. Bufiuel made his films in the first two decades of the twentieth century, while Almodovar has created his in the last two decades of the last millennium. Due to the character and thematic content of their films, it is inevitable to compare these prolific directors. Both are independent filmmakers, whose creations remain outside of the mainstream and noncommercial. Despite their marginalization, they have obtained worldwide recognition and success. Each has won numerous film awards, including Oscars for Best Foreign Film. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship.) """
"John Keats says of Shakespeare that he ""led a life of Allegory; his works are the comments on it."" Although his meaning is obscure, Keats is clearly interested in the mysterious relationship between Shakespeare\'s life and the works that provide us with our only access to that life. For Keats the day-to-day actions of Shakespeare\'s life rise to the level of allegory precisely because Shakespeare exists for us primarily in his dramatic poetry - in the language of his characters. Keats pursues an understanding of Shakespeare\'s poetic mind through an intense study of his characters and poetry; by habitually immersing himself in Shakespeare\'s art, Keats hopes to achieve for himself the poetic dexterity which allows Shakespeare to exist through the lives of his creations. By exploring Shakespeare\'s plays, particularly A Midsummer Night\'s Dream and A Winter\'s Tale, two plays that Keats alludes to in some of his greatest poems, we can gain further understanding of the tension and pursuits within Keats\'s own poems, and see how his development as a poet was shaped by his predecessor.

"""In many of his works, the American painter Winslow Homer (1836-1910) depicted man's confrontation of nature, and specifically, the sea. By examining works spanning the duration of Homer's life, a progression is evident from man's positive and fulfilling relationship with nature, to man's tenuous and ominous struggle with nature. Homer suggests that mankind must respect and revere nature's magnitude and power in order to survive."""
"""Twentieth-century American southern writer James Branch Cabell has not been read much since the 1920s when his work gained popularity due to his supposedly decadent lifestyle. Besides stirring up rumors concerning his homosexuality and murderous tendencies, though, Cabell also contributed a 54-volume fantasy book to American literature that was admired by Samuel Clemens and T. S. Eliot alike for its ironic wit and freedom from restricting morality. Cabell's cycle of Manuel meant a variety of things to his contemporaries, and - given the dearth of recent scholarship on Cabell - it is only through his literary friends using his name in their own writing can we learn about his place in American Modernism. He has been touted as a father of science fiction and fantasy; he has also been called a lazy Victorianist and hopeless Romantic. One purpose of my project is to understand what various authors such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Carl Van Vechten mean to accomplish when they call upon Cabell in their novels. Another goal for my work on Cabell is to prompt the return of his work to the canon. (I am grateful to the Dean of the College and the Schiff Fellowship Program for supporting my research.) """

"""The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a nation in crisis. Since the overthrow of President Mobutu Sese Seka in 1997, a bitter civil war involving several African nations has eaten away at the structure of the state and plunged the nation further into chaos.

At independence in 1960, the Congo descended into a long period of economic and political instability. An examination of this period is crucial to any understanding of the current situation. This discussion will highlight one actor in the Congo, the World Bank and present a chronology of the Bank's activities in the nation since 1960, the year of independence. The individual Bank projects, the ideology behind the Bank's involvement in the Congo, and the historical importance of the Bank in the Congo, relative to other actors, will be discussed in the framework of an economic history of the Congo.

"After the stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing depression, nearly every country faced economic and social crises of unprecedented scale. In Japan, reformoriented intellectuals, often described by historians as ""fascists,"" led the country\'s search for a new order to overcome the depression. At the same time their contemporaries in America, the progressive architects of the welfare state and new liberalism, were engaged in the creation of the New Deal. Although their respective political orientations appear to be diametrical opposites, intellectuals in both countries shared similar ideas about reform through the power of the state based largely on their critique of capitalism and their experiences with economic mobilization during World War I. A comparison of their policies of economic and social policies reveals that, despite profound differences in cultural and political context, ""authoritarian"" Japan and ""liberal"" America developed remarkably similar responses to the depression.

"""English The portrayal of Eve in John Milton's Paradise Lost has been interpreted in many controversial ways, with both misogynistic and feminist views. Not only have these views both been strongly supported, but also the social context in which these views were conveyed has given Eve a complex number of facets that have changed over time. Interpretation itself is not subject to any rigid structure; because of this, Eve's role in The Fall has been a controversial topic. However, by studying Milton's other works, looking at philosophical influences, and reading relevant excerpts from the Bible, Eve is redeemed. Through the reinterpretation of Milton's description of Eve, it is clear that he portrayed the feminist view of an independent woman who executed her actions intentionally and deliberately. """

Throughout her letters, the struggle to maintain her sons' honor and that of the Strozzi family in general is Alessandra's central concern. Among the aspects of life in Florentine society that she feels are the keys to honor are successful careers, good marriage alliances, a place in political life and keeping up a respectable appearance. Of these concerns, that of finding suitable husbands and wives for her children is always foremost in her mind. She writes of these marriage arrangements as one would of business deals involving large sums of money and carefully chosen alliances.

"""From the first sentence of her novel, Nervous Conditions, Tsitsi Dangarembga casts a heroine whose unapologetic individuality startles the reader. Her narration strikes swiftly and directly at the heart of the complex issues facing a Zimbabwe on the cusp of independence in the '60s and '70s. By casting her reportage in the psychologically analytical perceptions of Tambu, Dangarembga reveals both the internalities and the externalities of the diverse situation facing a society in upheaval. Nervous Conditions describes anxious times and the often difficult decisions that its characters make in those times. It is a story about choice: freedom to and freedom from. It signals the emergence of a New Africa, one that has awakened from the long sleep of colonialism to oppose the constraints that hemmed it to ways contrary to its natural processes, and to embrace the truth of its condition.

"Hildegard of Bingen was a ""Wellesley woman"" of the early Middle Ages. The lyrics written by this twelfth-century abbess and polymath extensively examine the juxtaposition of Eve and the Virgin Mary. For the production of my book, I selected four antiphons and one responsory, all of which address this relationship. I translated the poems from their original Latin, then printed the book, using a Vandercook SP-15 with hand-set Centaur and Arrighi types. This project was a unique opportunity to combine two of my passions: poetry and book arts, which when these poems were written, were one in the same. The written word was considered an art form, as illuminated manuscripts attest. My book is not a manuscript reproduction, but rather it incorporates the ideas and ideals of one - the contrast of black text to a creamy white page, the sanctity of handcrafting and the painstaking process of illustration.

In figurative terms, however, observation motivates personal perspective. Viewers transition through this ""site-unspecific"" installation which is meant to facilitate an experiential analysis of the layered meanings of ""point of view."" Although the creators of such a work can construct a position or locality which forces, focuses or limits one\'s observational view, they cannot create the meaning. The viewer derives (the) meaning based upon personal perspectives but these perspectives change as the viewer\'s physical position changes. The essence of this installation, then, is simply that a person\'s ""point of view"" is a function of and contingent upon their ""point of view."" '"

"This research tested whether gender acts as a status characteristic among preschool children. Status characteristics are individual qualities such as age, race, gender or education that are linked to power and influence. Past research has shown that gender does act as a status characteristic among adults, with men possessing higher status than women, but such research has not been done with children. Jo this study, children were presented with stories involving male and female puppets; in each story one puppet attempts to influence the other using either a masculine or feminine style of communication. It was hypothesized that if gender acts as a status characteristic, children should report that boys are more influential than girls are and that boys are also more dominant and competent than girls. Tests of this hypothesis will be presented and their implications discussed. '"

Following each vignette, participants were asked: 1) to rate the extent to which the characters in the vignette were likely to form a friendship, and 2) to rate the quality of that potential friendship. To assess the impact of contextual variables on these ratings, data were gathered on difficulties associated with transition to college, acculturation and multicultural exposure. '"
"""The woman's suffrage movement was one of the most well documented movements in American history. Yet, the scholarship that has been done in this field has mainly focused on the East. While the franchise was extended to American women in 1920, some women in the Western territories had the right to vote a half a century earlier. However, there is little analysis as to why the West enfranchised women before the East. The work that has been done on the West has looked at suffrage from an isolationist viewpoint. Western states have either been studied individually or as a collective group with little respect to what was occurring in the East at the same time. There has been little attempt at comparing and contrasting eastern and western leadership styles, campaigns and tactics. A comparison of Colorado and Massachusetts reveals much about women's suffrage in the West. This analysis exposes regionalism as an explanation for the extension of the franchise to women in the West. """
"For more than a century, American Indian reservations have ranked among the poorest communities in the United States. Recent scholarship has blamed unstable reservation governments for this predicament, but this perspective overlooks the importance of the history behind governmental instability. Through historical examination of the Fort Peck Indian reservation in Montana, factionalism is identified as an underlying factor inhibiting economic growth. Federal policies, local patronage networks and disputes rooted in cultural change have created an environment of factional conflict that impedes economic development at Fort Peck, but contemporary proposals do not adequately address the impact of these internal and external influences.

"This year, an advanced infrared ""optical tweezers"" setup was constructed and characterized at Wellesley. Optical tweezers have many useful applications, ranging from constructing very small ""nanostructures"" to studying biological systems. Our setup will be used to study physical properties of biological interactions. These devices work on a much smaller scale than do conventional tweezers, and use lasers to ""grab"" small objects. Once trapped, the objects can be held for observation, moved or collided with other trapped objects without damaging or contaminating samples. In order to study physical interactions quantitatively, one must first have a good calibration of the trapping force. Our optical tweezers have computer-controlled manipulation of the sample position which allows us to calibrate the horizontal trapping forces using the known fluid drag forces. Vertical trapping forces will be measured by varying the power of the laser. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship.) '"
"Optical tweezers are tools for nonintrusive manipulation of micrometer-sized particles.

While conducting research in the laser cooling and trapping group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, I worked on the construction and calibration of a laser trapping/ablation system consisting of optical tweezers and a laser scalpel. This versatile device allowed us to study biological interactions of the microscopic level. Polystyrene spheres and liposomes were trapped and manipulated within imprinted mirochannels to study their surface adhesion interactions with different plastic materials.

"""A choral composition of unprecedented dimensions, the St. Matthew Passion is one of J. S. Bach's greatest works. Putatively intended for the 1727 Good Friday services of his Lutheran congregation in Leipzig, it testifies to his consummate musical skill, which to this day continues to succeed in stirring even the most concealed of human emotions. This paper argues that in order for such magnificence to be comprehensible, the composer gave the work a durable internal structure. Just as the great buildings of civilization require support systems, so do works of music; indeed, one can discover that musical architecture forms the foundation of Bach's Passion. Five pillars of repetitions of a popular Protestant chorale support the surrounding musical movements, thereby functioning as its framework. The placement and variation of these pillars determines the structure and flow of the work, shaping it into an architecture of the highest form. """

"For most Americans, the phrase ""American Dream"" conjures up the image of an industrious individual, who, despite humble beginnings, achieves success. Although this phrase first entered the American vocabulary during the 1930s, historians have argued that the same concept of social mobility was used to promote and defend the wage labor system that emerged in the northern United States during the early nineteenth century. While this argument documents an important development in the conception of the American Dream, it fails to address southern notions of success during the antebellum period.

Roosevelt integrated traditional liberal conceptions of social contract theory and negative rights with a unique perspective on American history and a radical reformulation of the relationship between government and the people. In so doing, he created a political philosophy that was extraordinarily conducive both to his personal electoral success and to the evolution of the modern ""welfare state.""

Measuring the spectra in dilute solution or in doped solids is frequently inconclusive due to the formation of aggregates resulting in proximity of the metal ions. Our work takes a different approach to address this question. We dissolve complexes of Cr (III), a d3 system, in various plastic matrices, and then use emission spectroscopy to test for energy transfer. The emission of these complexes arises from the 'E\xf4\x80\x84\x8b4A, transition, and should be quite sharp in the absence of energy transfer. We will present data on the synthesis of the matrices, the temperature dependence of the emission spectra and the dependence of emission lifetime on metal ion concentration in the matrix in an effort to determine whether or not cooperative interactions exist in the complexes of Cr (III) with delocalized ligands such as 2,4- pentanedione. These cooperative interactions should increase as the concentration of the metal ion increases."""

"Two related constructs in psychology focus on whether people feel they are being ""real"" in their interactions. The ""Impostor Phenomenon,"" refers to feelings that one has fooled others into believing that one is competent. ""Loss of Voice"" refers to when people feel unable to express their feelings and opinions freely. These two constructs are similar in their hypothesized societal and familial origins, but have yielded conflicting results with respect to gender. This study was designed to explore the relationship between the Impostor Phenomenon, Loss of Voice, psychological masculinity and femininity and a newly developed measure of distress concerning inauthenticity in interpersonal relationships. Two hundred men and women completed this set of measures. We hypothesize that differences in psychological masculinity and femininity, more than gender alone, will be related to impostor feelings and loss of voice. Because feminine values include authenticity in relationships, feminine individuals should experience greater conflict over authenticity. '"
"My presentation is a reading of several poems from an original collection I have been working on during the past year. The majority of the poems are centered on female life and are written in the first person. Often the ""I"" confronts another character in the direct addresses of ""you."" Most of the poetry describes events in my life. The process of writing such poems reconciles myself with my encounters. Although my poetry is confessional in style, the ""I"" speaker is not always myself. I often alter details and shift point of view from witness to participant. Therefore, women with children or husbands speak through the verse. These women and others confront the reader with accounts of their physical and emotional experiences. '"
"Students walking through the main entrance to Clapp Library every day may not realize that they are passing the bronze doors made by Evelyn Beatrice Longman, a prominent early-twentieth-century American sculptor. Longman (1874-1954) was the first woman sculptor to become a full member of the National Academy of Design. In publications of her day, she was hailed as one of the most successful women sculptors and was compared favorably against the men with whom she competed for commissions. Despite her prominence during her lifetime, she has been virtually ignored in contemporary scholarly literature. Researching how Longman received commissions for large-scale public monuments reveals how she was able to establish a professional reputation in a male-dominated art world. Examining her work within its art historical context shows how the tension between modernism and traditionalism, as well as changing beliefs about the role of public sculpture, have affected how her work is remembered today.

"This thesis investigates the extent to which people consider situational variables in their use of interpersonal distance as a cue for interpersonal relationships. Interpersonal distance describes the physical spacing between two interacting individuals. Past research consistently demonstrates that people interacting with smaller interpersonal distances are perceived as having closer relationships than people interacting with larger interpersonal distances. This study questions how perceptions of relationships change when situational variables of choice and stress are manipulated. Participants were shown pictures of figures in high stress, low stress, choice and no choice situations and were asked to rate the degree of friendship between the figures. Participants ranged from preschool to college age. '"
"The existence of multiple memory systems is an important topic in psychology and will be the focus of this study. One form of memory is priming. Priming refers to an increased ability to identify a stimulus, such as a word or picture, after previously being exposed to that stimulus. It has been assumed that priming is beneficial because of the improvement in identifying stimuli as a result of this prior exposure. Recent research using a perceptual identification test has suggested that priming may not be solely facilitative, but instead may entail costs as well as benefits. This study will investigate how different experimental manipulations affect the cost and benefit in priming. The results will demonstrate whether the same underlying memory systems support the cost and benefit, or whether there are separate cognitive mechanisms supporting the cost and benefit in priming.

"The life-course implications of the personality characteristic of Emotional Instability were examined in a sample of 90 men and women studied from late adolescence through older age. Emotional Instability was defined in terms of a propensity to experience negative affect and have problems with impulse control. Because participants in this study were born in the 1920s and reached adolescence in the 1930s and 1940s, a time when gender expectations differed for men and women, Emotional Instability had different life-course implications for emotionally unstable boys and girls. A history of adolescent Emotional Instability for men manifested itself in lower economic attainment in older age. In contrast, emotionally unstable girls had problems with interpersonal relations and lower life satisfaction scores later in life. Comparisons of emotionally unstable individuals who decreased in emotional instability with age (improvers) with individuals who remained high in emotionally instability throughout their lives (nonchangers) will also be discussed.

"Previous research has found that social support can protect against depressive symptoms. The present study explores this relationship further to see how individual differences in the construction of the self influence the protective process. The main hypothesis concerns whether different selfconcepts are more or less protective against depressive symptoms in the presence or absence of a satisfying close relationship. I predict there will be an interaction such that more satisfying relationships will protect against depressive symptoms for those who are psychologically feminine, those with a relational orientation and Asian Americans. However, for those who are psychologically masculine, those with a personal orientation and European Americans, I predict there will be no relationship or a significantly weaker relationship between quality of relationships and depressive symptoms. Participants in this study completed a series of self-report measures assessing depressive symptoms, satisfaction with their relationships and the structure of the self. '"

"A 1997 community relations report indicated that ""more than three-quarters of professionals have full-time community relations responsibilities."" This figure is ever rising, and it is a call to action for those professionals with the time, resources and knowledge to help their community. This report is a case study of one Boston firm (Firm X) that seems to be excelling with the likeminded professionals who are committed to helping their communities by giving time, money, services and personal dedication. Firm X designed an initiative that not only makes community service a visible and active aspect of the firm, but it holds community involvement equal to the firm\'s core traditions, values and client relations. This study specifically focuses on two variables related to the life and success of the firm: recruitment and retention of employees. Further, it examines whether Firm X\'s initiative has discrete positive effects on these two variables and, in turn, on the overall quality of life of Firm X\'s employees. The traditional ""bottom line"" has shifted, and a professional commitment to community service not only affects members of the firm, but it affects the firm\'s overall success. '"

"""Though they composed a large number of celebrated orchestral works, both Beethoven and Brahms are equally well known for their chamber music. The two composers chose Vienna as their home, and there they composed works that formed the bridge between the classical forms of Mozart and the showy and dramatic music of Wagner and Liszt. Beethoven's Quartet in F minor was written in 1810 and showcases the tempestuous turn that chamber music had taken since the days of Haydn and Mozart. Brahms' Trio for Hom, Violin and Piano in E-flat, composed in 1865, signifies the movement toward the late romantic period. These two pieces epitomize, as well as any set of symphonies, the path that classical music took over the first half of the nineteenth century. """
"The architectural climate of Wellesley College was marked with a burst of extraordinary growth and renovation in the last decade of the twentieth century. With each of these building projects, there has been a concern for the continuity of legacy and tradition. Similarly, these concerns hold prevalence today in the wake of the redevelopment of the landscape and road systems, the mitigation of contaminated property, thorough building renovations with technological updates and the construction of new buildings and superstructures. In meeting these contemporary needs, however, polarities often emerge between aesthetics, siting or modernity and tradition, yet the mainstay of the college is dependent upon the integration and perpetuation of our collegiate legacy. Various case studies of this campus invariably address some of these issues and convey their interconnectedness. Most important though, they are consistently relevant to the campus planning and thus can help shape our thinking about building at Wellesley in the future and the legacy that we will leave for others to live with.

"""Plato's Symposium gathers several individuals to speak in praise of Eros. The text's foreign language and its expression of ways of thinking strange to us complicate the challenge of understanding its message. But the inherent biological importance of Eros makes his influence and origin interesting and opens access to notions presented by Plato's speakers. The process of translating and interpreting the original Greek is made difficult by the distance of ancient ideas, vocabulary and behaviors but is encouraged by the presence of steadfast, common tendencies and values. Phaedrus' encomium, for example, attributes the noblest human courage to love's inspiration - an idea that may be familiar from contemporary suggestions in literature and our own experiences. Then, perhaps un-familiarly, the speakers regarded love as a deity. Phaedrus praises him as one of the oldest gods, and observes that the other gods honor those who demonstrate his inspiration. These are more foreign conceptions that, along with the new words that Plato uses to present them, offer a more involved challenge to understanding. """
"In the final play of Aeschylus\' Oresteian trilogy, the powerful and blood-thirsty chthonic goddesses known as the Furies, proclaim of themselves, ""This is the office that relentless Fate has ordained for us to hold securely when wanton murders of kin come to mortals, we pursue them until they descend below the earth."" According to earlier poets, the Furies\' responsibilities included the punishment of murderers, the protection of justice and even the maintenance of universal order, but in Aeschylus\' Eumenides, the Furies are zealously and completely occupied with their role as ""avengers of the blood."" However, by the end of the play, the Furies are transformed into goddesses who protect life rather than destroy it. By looking at specific passages of the text of Eumenides, I will examine Aeschylus\' interpretation of the complex nature of these goddesses as agents of both vengeance and justice, social chaos and order, spiritual and familial pollution and purification and, finally, both.

In examining the way in which Herodotus leads up to and describes these scenes, I will explore how he appropriates techniques, from epic and drama to write in the genre of history. In my analysis, I will discuss how Herodotus employs these techniques not so much to emphasize the dramatic aspects of these stories, but instead to comment on the workings of fate, the predictability of human nature and the linear progression of events, one leading inevitably to another, throughout history.

During this time, Serbian perpetrators executed rapes in a systematic manner as an essential tactic of war. Serbian soldiers used rape as a tool against Muslims in their drive for a ""Greater Serbia."" Throughout the genocide, the Serbian perpetrators used rape as a tool primarily in five ways: to destroy the Muslim culture and community, to drive Muslims out of Bosnia, to symbolize the defeat of the Muslims, to expand the Serbian race through forced impregnation and to encourage morale among the Serbian soldiers.

"Many research studies have examined the numerous structural, cultural and psychological barriers preventing Asian women from leaving an abusive relationship, but little research has investigated the coping mechanisms battered Asian women use. This exploratory study primarily focuses on the significant but silenced community of battered Korean immigrant women and hopes to shed some light on the coping strategies and resources that they employ during the course of domestic violence. Through focus groups of Korean women and interviews with service providers, I anticipate finding certain coping mechanisms: positivism, hope and culturally-accepted values such as fatalism and perseverance. I will address how Korean women stay emotionally and psychologically healthy while enduring violence, how their coping strategies may be culturally bound and how their strategies compare to those of battered Caucasian women.

"Last year the Japanese government released statistics reporting the frequency of domestic violence in Japan. Since this first step has been made, Japan is on the threshold of important decisions that will color the future of domestic violence and intimate gender relations. It is important to understand why the problem has been ignored for such a Jong time and what has caused such dismissal. This presentation examines gender roles in Japan from a historical perspective, analyzing the forces and/or institutions that perpetuate violence amongst intimates. Confucian principles, the concept of ie and traditional gender roles contribute to rigid expectations of women, which prevent women from escaping partner violence. Such background information helps explain the complexities and context of domestic violence within Japan as well as the current and future measures to prevent domestic violence and protect battered women.

"""Same-sex marriages have long been the subject of debate - especially in the United States. Marriage is assigned a great number of social and legal benefits as well as regulations in order to protect the parties involved. The denial of these benefits to queer people through laws banning samesex marriage only makes rational economic sense if there is a strong argument on the state's behalf showing an overriding public interest. The economic efficiencies of laws banning same-sex marriages are examined using a cost-benefit analysis. We conclude using this analysis that there are no reasonable economic arguments that can defend laws prohibiting same-sex marriages. Therefore, such laws are due not to rational economic arguments, but rather to discrimination in the form of homophobia. This result is not significantly different from findings of tl1e effects of racism and sexism on wages before civil rights protection banded such forms of discrimination. """

"""Designing programs around the natural decomposition of a problem into modules makes it easier for programmers to write and maintain programs. This principle is known as modularity. Despite the benefits of modularity, it introduces inefficiency into programs, in part due to the creation of intermediate data structures such as lists and trees. Deforestation is a program transformation that eliminates some of these structures, allowing programmers to write modular programs with reckless abandon and still enjoy the efficiency benefits of monolithic programming. Most existing deforestation algorithms require the input program to be in a restricted form in order to ensure that deforestation occurs. Olaf Chitil has recently developed a type-inference-based algorithm for deforestation, which removes some of these restrictions. Chitil has also developed a prototype that partially implements this algorithm. This prototype requires more development in order to test it on example programs. This year I am working on developing the tools necessary to test the prototype, with the goal of fully implementing Chitil's algorithm. My work will lead to a stronger basis for comparison between different deforestation techniques, and to a better understanding of how deforestation works in practice.

"The enzyme EC 3.4.24.15 is activated by thiol reagents. There are 14 cysteines in the protein, three of which are thought to be located near the active site. Disulfide bridges involving these three cysteines are believed to block substrate access to the active site. In the presence of thiol reagents, an increase in enzyme activity is observed. A triple mutant, in which the three active site cysteines have been replaced by serines, is 20 times more active than the wildtype. However, we have found that other, possibly surface, cysteine residues are responsible for aggregation and precipitation of the protein. Exhaustive alkylation of the surface cysteines produces wildtype and mutant enzymes ten-fold more active than the unmodified wild-type protein. However, the activity is still lower than that of the unmodified mutant. This implies that optimal activity occurs when the three cysteines near the active site are reduced, while other cysteines are not.

"Adenosine is a signaling molecule that is elevated in the lungs of asthmatics and has been implicated to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is a purine catabolic enzyme that controls adenosine levels. Consequently, ADA-deficient mice develop severe asthma in association with elevated adenosine. Systemic ADA enzyme therapy can prevent severe asthma in this model by lowering adenosine levels. It is not known, however, whether this effect is a consequence of lowering local or systemic levels of adenosine. To address this, both injection and inhalation routes of ADA delivery were compared. It was shown that intranasally administered ADA lowered lung adenosine levels. Furthermore, the intranasally administered ADA remained localized to the lung. This study suggests that inhalation of ADA will be sufficient to produce similar effects as seen with the injection of ADA, only with local effects. (Research supported by a Zimmermann grant.) '"
"The enzyme EC 3.4.24.15 (EP 24.15) binds and cleaves peptides of 20 amino acids or less. Possible endogenous substrates for the enzyme include bradykinin, gonadotropin releasing hormone and neurotensin. In the laboratory, activity of EP 24.15 is most easily monitored using quenched fluorescent substrates. Previous studies have shown that in the optimal pH range for the enzyme (from 7.0 to 8.0), hydrolysis of substrate is enhanced by the addition of manganese or calcium ions. In an effort to determine the nature of the interaction between the divalent metals, protein and/or substrate, we have determined kinetic parameters for the protein over a wide pH range with and without the addition of Mn(II) and Ca(II). The metals both enhance binding and increase maximal velocity. These observations suggest that the effect of metal ions may be due in part to their substitution for protons involved in binding substrate.

"The synthesis of a series of potentially biologically active nucleosides involves ribosidation at the N-4 position of 1,2,4-triazole. Our research has focused on developing a methodology for the N-4 ribosidation. When a substituent is added to 1,2,4-triazole, it is placed at the undesired N-1 position. However, we have found that when a second substituent is added to the N-1 substituted 1,2,4-triazole, the second substituent adds at the desired N-4 position. Therefore, we are working on placing a substituent at the N-1 position of 1,2,4-triazole which can be removed at a later step. We then add the ribose group at the desired N-4 position, and remove the substituent at N-1 to obtain our desired product.

"Found in all living organisms, nucleosides are a biologically important class of molecules which function in such molecules as ATP and DNA. Several nucleoside analogs are known to exhibit anti-tumor or antiviral activity because of their ability to inhibit biological processes.

"Tuberculosis, once one of the most common and most feared diseases, disappeared from the consciousness of most Americans and Europeans after several potent antibiotics were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s. Recently, the emergence of virulent drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a sharp increase in the number of cases worldwide have led to the urgent need for the development of newer and more effective drugs. As part of our long-standing interests in the chemistry of organic hydrazines and the chemotherapy of tuberculosis, we have been investigating reliable and reproducible methods for the preparation of tuberculostatic derivatives of acid hydrazides on such a scale and in such purity as to be suitable for subsequent biological evaluation. We have now found that a variety of acid hydrazides react cleanly with diketones to produce acylamidopyrroles in good yields. The latter compounds represent an interesting and less common class of heterocycles, some of which are isomeric with the demonstrated tuberculostats isonicotinic acid hydrazide and pyrazinamide. Research has focused on the confirmation of product structures, the study of the synthetic reactions by examination of possible intermediates and the evaluation of chemical properties key to tuberculostatic action.

"The leaves of evergreens such as Rhododendron maximum have the ability to survive the incredibly stressful conditions of the winter months in New England. Cold temperatures in combination with high light as well as freezing temperatures can permanently damage the photosynthetic apparatus and the entire leaf. We are only beginning to understand the mechanisms that allow leaves to acclimate to cold climates and to survive these conditions. However, it is clear that changes in protein composition must play a crucial role in the protection of photosynthetic apparatus and the membranes of these leaves. We therefore analyzed the total protein composition of Rhododendron leaves harvested at various points throughout the fall and winter. Using 2-dimentional gel electrophoresis, we were able to document and quantify protein changes associated with the acclimation of Rhododendron maximum leaves to winter conditions. '"
"Temperature regulation is an intricate process influenced by factors that respond to both central and local control mechanisms. In order to enhance our understanding of the role of sex hormones on the balance between heat loss and gain, we have utilized laser Doppler imaging (LOI) as a novel approach for monitoring finger blood flow in women. The fingers are a major site of heat loss and LOI results indicate that there are cyclical changes in finger blood flow throughout the menstrual cycle. The baseline pattern that was observed showed an increasing trend from the luteal phase to the preovulatory phase to the follicular phase and then to menses. A similar, but less pronounced trend was also found in the maximum vasodilation values, which were recorded in response to a major stimulus, i.e., restricting blood flow to the hand. However, this pattern was reversed when the maximum response was corrected for baseline measurements.'"
"Previous studies have shown that there is a definite increase of finger temperature at night in both men and women and that this rise in temperature is necessary to fall asleep. This is in contrast to changes in core body temperature, which decreases during sleep. In our study, we are addressing questions related to whether sex hormones secreted during the menstrual cycle alter blood flow in the hands and feet, either at night or during the day. In our initial studies we compared vasodilatation in the fingers during periods of sleep and nonsleep in both male and female subjects. Not only does the temperature of the hands increase during sleep, but there are pulses of vasodilatation seen in both male and female subjects. During sleep, these pulses are greater and of longer duration. In contrast, during wakefulness, the pulses are of shorter duration, of smaller magnitude and more frequent. Our next question was to determine whether the pattern of vasodilatation during sleep and wakefulness varied over the menstrual cycle. We measured core body temperature to indicate the phase of the menstrual cycle along with finger temperature in five female subjects as well as in three control male subjects. There does seem to be a difference in finger temperature in females during the daytime at different phases of the menstrual cycle. (Research was funded by the Fiske Fund.

Proliferation of cells was monitored by in vivo labeling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Data shows a peak in neurogenesis between the hours of 4:30 P.M. and 7:30 P.M., with dusk occurring at 6 P.M. This trend suggests that there may be a coupling of environmental and endogenous factors in the control of the rhythmicity of neurogenesis. Ongoing studies are being conducted with an altered 24-hour light-dark period, with 6 A.M. becoming dusk and 6 P.M. becoming dawn, in order to see if the rhythmicity is indeed influenced by the light cycle.

"The photosynthetic apparatus in plants needs to maintain the delicate balance between maximizing the harvesting of light energy to sustain life processes, and minimizing the amount of reactive oxygen species generated by excess energy at the thylakoid membrane in an oxygen-rich environment. As plants encounter excess light, it triggers a cascade of events at the thylakoid membrane, such as oxidative damage, photoprotection and repair. Much research has been done identifying and analyzing the mechanisms in response to oxidative stress. However, most studies have focused on a few proteins, while very little is known about the magnitude of the global protein changes at a given time point. The focus of my thesis research is to take a ""snapshot"" of the protein changes induced by oxidative stress by looking at the thylakoid membrane proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

"Yarrowia lipolytica is a dimorphic yeast that replicates by budding or by forming hyphae. Hyphal formation is a characteristic that is typically found in pathogenic yeasts such as Candida albicans. In order to isolate mutations in genes involved in hyphal formation for further study, we are adapting the method of restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REM!). This method uses restriction enzymes to insert linearized plasmids into the chromosomal DNA at restriction sites, creating tagged mutations. REM! has previously been successful in other yeasts but has not been tried in Y. lipolytica. A variety of plasmids were transformed into Yarrowia strain El22 in the presence of the BamHI enzyme to stimulate restriction enzymemediated integration. Both lithium-acetate and electroporation were used to transform El22. Preliminary results show some stimulation in transformation when BamHI is present, suggesting that restriction enzyme-mediated integration events have occurred.

"The cytoskeleton of all higher cells plays a central role in a number of essential functions including cellular mobility, transport, communication and division.

To study the genes involved in the regulation of filamentous growth, a mutant was isolated using ultra-violet light. The recessive mutant YNFl is temperature sensitive and unable to form filaments at 30\xc2\xb0C, but can at room temperature. The mutant was also tested for filamentous growth on several different media. No hyphae were seen on plates containing fatty acid and glucose. On media supplemented with bovine calf serum or N-acetylglucosamine, filaments were only seen at room temperature not at 30\xc2\xb0C. (Research supported by a grant from Wellesley College.) '"
"""I would like to believe this is a story I'm telling. I need to believe it. I must believe it. Those who can believe that such stories are only stories have a better chance. If it's a story I'm telling, then I have control over the ending. As explained by Offred in Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, storytelling, even to just the individual herself, is a type of power, and therefore control, over a difficult situation. In this novel, Offred's creative self-expression and resulting control comes to serve as an important means of survival and self\xc2\xadpreservation. This, however, is not a pattern unique to Offred. Other Atwood characters in her novels and poetry have also relied upon creative means such as art and writing in order to deal with, and then control, their surroundings - all of which results in an attempt at self-preservation. This attempt may be influenced by myriad factors, including the situation in which the character finds herself and the amount of effort that she places in her survival mechanism. """
"We plan to present the results of our final project from our Research Methods in Social Psychology class (Psych 310R, Fall). We collected data from a random sample of Wellesley College students to determine the social perceptions of job candidates based on the interaction effect of corporate attire (traditional or individualized) and corporate culture (traditional or casual). Participants were presented with information about the company and the candidate and asked to fill out a questionnaire as if they were in the role of the interviewer. We hypothesized that the effects of attire would be most pronounced within the traditional culture condition, but that synchronicity between culture and attire would result in the most positive social perceptions. Data analysis using SPSS yielded significant results that we would like to share with the college community, particularly with those students in the job market. '"
"Past research demonstrates that lonely people are perceived by others to have negative personality characteristics. This study examines how the amount of time spent on the Internet affects the social stigma against lonely people. Descriptions of a target male with varying degrees of loneliness and Internet use were given to participants. Participants were then asked to rate their perceptions based on the description. We hypothesized that lonely people with high Internet use would be perceived most negatively, and nonlonely people with low Internet use would be perceived most positively. Our results confirm that lonely people are perceived more negatively than nonlonely people on the dimensions of social desirability, attractiveness, health and psychological adjustment. On some measures, such as desirability as a friend or an acquaintance, sincerity and ambition, high Internet users were also perceived more negatively than low Internet users. '"
"Daydreaming frequency and characteristics have both revealed a consistent pattern of association with the basic components and related constructs of shyness. This pattern forms the basis of this study, in which 92 college women completed a packet of questions including the Shyness Syndrome Inventory (Cheek and Melchior, 1985) and part of the Stanford Shyness Survey (Zirnbardo, 1977), the Daydreaming Frequency scale of the Imaginal Processes Inventory (Singer and Antrobus, 1970) and a measurement of daydream characteristics known as the Short Imaginal Processes Inventory (Huba et al., 1982). Results indicate that people with higher levels of shyness report a higher frequency of daydreaming on the IPI subscale, more Guilt and Fear-of\xc2\xadFailure Daydreams but not any more Positive-Constructive Daydreams and Poorer Attentional Control on the SIP1 test. Findings suggest that daydreams serve shyness through tension reduction and wish-fulfillment strategies. A replication study of 110 subjects is currently being conducted. '"
"""A study was conducted to examine the effect of intrinsic motivation training on preschool children's motivational orientation and creativity in a reward situation. Previous research has shown that the expectation of reward can severely undermine intrinsic task motivation and qualitative aspects of performance, including creativity. Some investigations have, however, revealed that it may be possible to immunize elementary school children against the negative effects of reward. In the present study, preschoolers were randomly placed in one of two conditions. Children took part in either an intrinsic motivation training session or in a control (no training) session. After these conversations, all children met with a second experimenter who asked them to make a collage. Half of the children made their collage with the expectation of a reward, and half received a prize as an unexpected bonus. Children were then interviewed and asked to rate the collage activity for liking and intrinsic interest. All products were also rated by appropriate judges on creativity, technical skill, liking and aesthetic appeal. Finally, analyses were conducted to determine whether the children exposed to intrinsic motivation training were, in fact, able to maintain baseline levels of task motivation and creativity of performance in an expected reward situation.

"Prior research has shown that the imposition of external constraints, such as reward and evaluation, can decrease both intrinsic task motivation and creativity of performance. The present study examines the effect of intrinsic motivation training on college students. The primary question addressed is whether it is possible to immunize students against the usual deleterious effects of expected reward and competition/expected evaluation. Participants took part in either an intrinsic motivation training or control (no training) session utilizing a videotape and group discussion. They were then asked to complete open-ended verbal and artistic tasks, either with the expectation of reward or without the expectation of reward. One week later, in an effort to test the longevity of the training effects, creativity and task motivation were again assessed using another artistic and verbal task administered under competitive conditions. All products were then rated by appropriate judges on creativity, technical skill, liking and aesthetic appeal following the guidelines outlined in the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT) (Hennessey and Amabile, 2000). Finally, analyses were conducted to determine whether persons exposed to intrinsic motivation training were successfully immunized against the deleterious effects of extrinsic constraints. '"
"""Spread rumors about them? Destroy her property? Beat him up? How do people get even? This is a presentation of my thesis research, which examines how people in different social classes take revenge in modernity. Sociologists view modernity as an outcome of the process of industrialization in which forms of social and cultural life are radically changed. I propose that patterns of revenge-taking are different in the contemporary world than in pre-modernity in terms of space, time, scale, predictability and removal from the body. Modern revenge is less localized, cyclical, ritualized, prescribed and violent. Further, I hypothesize that people's social statuses affect the types of revenge they take. Through extensive interviews, I investigated how people from various social classes engaged in revenge behavior. """
"The ""Brain Drain"" was coined to describe the mass migration of African professionals from their native countries to the West over the past few decades. My previous study was about doctors who are reversing this trend. This study instead focuses on African health care professionals who have chosen to remain in their host countries. Is there awareness among these professionals that their absence contributes to the Brain Drain? Are their reasons for remaining purely financial, or are they more complex? Are there similarities in the stories they tell, which could help us better understand this sociological phenomenon? ""Choices in the Brain Drain"" is about these doctors, their lives and the compromises with which they live. It is about the difficult choices they make and continue to make as they live the realities of an African health care professional in the developed world.

"Education in South Asia faces many challenges. In an attempt to change this predicament, many not-for-profit groups have mushroomed, including one of the most noticeable in Pakistan: religious institutions, or madaris. Madaris are often started by religious scholars in an attempt to educate children in religious knowledge. Among many scholars, as well as in the Western media, madaris are considered backward institutions that harm, rather than benefit, society. However, on close examination, one finds that this assessment is both inadequate and imprecise. This presentation will analyze the impact of these madaris on education in Pakistan, and whether they are, or can be, successful in addressing educational needs. In addition, the new interest of the government in these schools will be addressed, highlighting the changing role of religion and religious organizations in the politics of Pakistan.

"""In studying young children's social development, friendships are often identified by asking children to name their friends. Young children, however, frequently do not realize that many of their friendships are unilateral (only one child nominates the other as a friend) rather than reciprocal (two children nominate each other as friends). The distinctions between unilateral and reciprocal friendships, as well as the similarities and differences between real friendships and relationships with imaginary friends, have received little study. These three types of friendship -reciprocal, unilateral and imaginary -theoretically may serve different functions for young children. This study examined these functions using social provisions: characteristics of relationships such as companionship, intimacy and affection. Distinctions were found between the levels of certain provisions received from reciprocal and unilateral friends as well as between reciprocal friends and nonfriends. """
"""Even before they can talk, we engage infants in elaborate conversations. This type of talk, called child-directed speech (CDS), differs from adult-directed speech (ADS) in prosody, syntax and semantics. Higher pitch and wider pitch excursions typify CDS in many languages. One theory suggests that CDS provides crucial information about language structure that helps the child break the speech stream into grammatical units. Not all researchers believe in the universality and utility of CDS. This study examines ADS and CDS in Hausa, a widely spoken West African language. Ten parents were recorded in semi-structured home observations. Speech samples analyzed for mean FO and pitch excursions will document whether Hausa speakers modify their language when addressing infants and whether this variation is similar to the patterns observed in other languages. The addition of Hausa to the list of communities employing CDS would contribute to the debate on its role in language acquisition.

"""How do story illustrations affect a child's ability to produce images? Will the imagination of Harry Potter readers be limited by illustrative models? Forty elementary school subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups. After hearing a taped segment from the Harry Potter series (J.K. Rowling), they were asked to draw what they were picturing in their minds as they were listening to the passage. While listening, one group was shown an illustration depicting the text, while the other group had no model from which to form their images. It is expected that the drawings produced by children who were not shown a sample illustration (Model Absent) will be judged to demonstrate a wider range of variability (in content and composition) than the pictures produced by the other (Model Present) design group. In addition, ratings will be made of the illustrations' creativity, technical quality, degree of realism and aesthetic appeal in order to make further between-group comparisons. """
"There are few photographs that are more intensely personal than the self-portrait. My self-portraits are an expression of an instantaneous moment in time: a raised eyebrow, a pleading gaze. I use them to change the way I look at myself and the way I present myself to others. They are a way for me to reassemble myself, piece by piece, shot by shot. By pushing myself, both as an artist and as my own subject, I hope to stretch the boundaries of what one expects from a self-portrait. This grid of images emphasizes the puzzle-like aspect of my work - the reassembling, the recreation, the redefining of self. This is my attempt to capture these pieces of time, these scraps of emotion, on film. (Research funded by a grant from the Office of the Dean of the College.) '"

The cooperative efforts of Nora Hussey, Director of Theatre and Theatre Studies, Katie Griswold, choreographer, Jeanne Munroe, musical director and the 2000-2001 student directors have created a diverse performance piece highlighting this year's shows and thereby showing the importance of history. As in the successful performances of previous years, the emphasis will be on the essence of theatre - the relationship between audience and actor. We present varied productions, illustrating the importance of history in a multitude of ways - taking as example the exuberant wit of The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940, the introspective drama of Joan of Arc or 1776 or the poignant tragedy of Corpus Christi. Through this showcase of nine shows, we gain insight into the triumph of the human spirit against all sorts of odds."""

"In this experiment, it was predicted that mode of dress and type of comment would influence perceptions of flirting behavior during initial heterosexual encounters between college students. Based on prior empirical research and casual observation, it was hypothesized that the interaction where a man approaches a ""dressed up"" woman and refers to having met her at a party is viewed as more flirtatious than a man who approaches a ""dressed down"" woman and asks for directions to the bathroom. A questionnaire was administered to participants who were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. Results were compared among the four scenarios and significant findings corroborated the initial hypothesis that indeed mode of dress and comment influence perceptions of flirtation. '"
"This study expands upon earlier research on gender differences in preschoolers\' exercise play. The sample included 31 children from a laboratory preschool in a suburban area of the United States. Children were asked to choose between paired photographs of ""more active"" activities versus ""less active"" activities. Additionally, the children\'s mothers completed surveys to provide a measure of maternal attitudes towards and participation in physical activity. The hypothesis was that boys would prefer more physical activities than girls would, and that girls\' preferences would be more influenced by their mothers\' attitudes towards exercise than would boys\' activity choices. Results of the picture task and mother survey did not support either hypothesis. On the picture task, girls chose active objects more often than boys, but the difference was not significant. The mothers\' activity levels, as indicated by their responses on the survey, did not relate to the activity levels of their children. Furthermore, there was no interaction between gender and mother\'s activity level as predictors of child\'s activity preference. These results suggest that the pattern of maternal differential reinforcement for their children\'s physical activity is not universal or perhaps does not exist. '"
"""Forty-eight undergraduate women viewed one of two photographs and one of two resumes of the male companion of a target female. Resumes and photographs of the male were manipulated to show either high or low levels of success/grooming. The target female's resume and photograph remained constant. The two were depicted as being involved in a romantic relationship. The results indicated that the manipulation of success was the determining factor in how the target female was perceived. When paired with a high success male companion in either grooming category, the female was perceived less self-confident, less intelligent and less successful than when paired with a low success male partner. However, the male's high success positively radiated to perceptions of the female target as more socially aware and approachable. Participants rated the relationship more positively (i.e., longevity and mutual partnership) when the male companion had high levels of success. """

"""In my presentation I will explore the constructs of black humor in both the novel and film adaptation of American Psycho. Specifically, I will compare the realization of black humor in a scene from the novel and its corresponding scene in the film. My talk will include a brief theoretical discussion of the role, use and history of black humor. I will address the critical beating that American Psycho has sustained (mainly because critics feel it is a celebration of senseless violence). My hope is that my discussion of the critical literature regarding American Psycho will show that most critics have misunderstood Eilis's metaphorical and satirical use of violence. Eilis's work is an investigation of the impact of an extreme capitalist mentality on treatments of the body, sexuality and the physical self. Black humor is a necessary strategy in Eilis's attempt to measure and represent the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. """

"""With an interest in the vital role of architecture, landscape and place creation in shaping the life and character of a neighborhood, and in forming individual and cultural identity, this paper considers the impact of two urban projects that integrate art, architecture and community revitalization. Project Row Houses in Houston and the casitas of New York City are different attempts at physical and social change in an urban environment. They offer important lessons for architects, planners and politicians who seek to affect change in some of the most depressed communities in the United States. Project Row Houses, the result of the vision of artist Rick Lowe, is a series of 22 shotgun houses that have been renovated and put to new use in Houston's Third Ward, a predominately African American, low-income community. Dilapidated and essentially abandoned when he first saw them, the houses have been transformed, through volunteer efforts and private donations, into installation art spaces, houses for young single mothers and classrooms for children. Building on the vision of the African American community portrayed in the work of painter John Biggers, Lowe's combination of art, housing and enrichment programming for local children is unique and successful. The casitas of New York are small, wooden, brightly painted houses that function as community centers in the Lower East Side, East Harlem, the South Bronx and Brooklyn. They closely resemble domestic vernacular architecture of Puerto Rico and have been built by Puerto Rican immigrants. They are usually accompanied by a garden and are on lots owned by the city but that have been functionally abandoned and left to go to waste. Each casita is different, but all are maintained by the casita members who come from the neighborhood, and in some cases distant neighborhoods, to use them. Many casitas and gardens have been Jost to development and many more are threatened as real estate values, particularly in the Lower East Side, escalate. This paper examines the lessons of Project Row Houses and the casitas from an architectural and urban planning standpoint. Among the issues considered are the link between place and cultural identity, the importance of nature in an urban setting, the role of art in people's lives and the need for diversity in an urban landscape. The project includes information gained from site visits and interviews in Houston and throughout New York, as well as readings in the architectural history of the pertinent forms, urban theory and planning and environmental psychology.

"In-depth, face-to-face interviews conducted recently with North Africans in France and their French counterparts provide an opportunity to observe a ""merging of cultures"" at work, as North African Muslims challenge the structure of French secular society. Though the French describe themselves as accepting of their North African neighbors and tolerant of their customs and beliefs, in fact, these sentiments are rarely in evidence. From their perspective, in order to prosper, these newcomers must embrace French customs and ideals. Indeed, the French express little or no interest in adapting, even passively, to ""Muslim ways."" While the North Africans are convinced that conforming to French culture ""in its entirety"" is the only strategy whereby they can avoid being ""ghettoized,"" they appear unwilling to sacrifice even minor Islamic customs and surround themselves almost exclusively with those of their own immigrant group. Thus a true ""cultural exchange,"" though a worthy goal, remains an elusive one. '"

"For numerous Western intellectuals, Soviet Communism represented the manifestation of Marxist ideals; but they often failed to recognize the disparity between the intellectual Marxism they cherished and the terror that Leninism and Stalinism wrought. Estimates of deaths in the USSR from executions, forced relocations, planned famines and brutal work camps exceed 20 million people and, for some, constitute genocide. Yet many intellectuals denied, excused or otherwise justified the USSR\'s tactics in an effort to preserve Marxist ideology. The later works of prominent labor historians Sidney and Beatrice Webb are a case study in Communist apologetics. Webb\'s case exemplifies a potential danger with ""armchair utopia-seekers"" who attempt to use their prestige to support political movements. It serves as a reminder that empathy for social suffering should be at the forefront of academic consciousness. '"

"This study concentrates on the long-term fate of several heavy metals (Pb, Cr, Cu, Cd, Mn, Zn and Fe) in a Cape Cod salt marsh which received high inputs of heavy metals from a sewage sludge-based fertilizer for the last 27 years. Although salt marshes are thought to be an effective sink for heavy metals, the long-term fate of metal pollutants in marsh sediments has not been well documented. Their effectiveness as a potential natural ""clean-up"" site for metals needs to be evaluated. To better understand the fate of heavy metals in marsh sediment, I am evaluating the current concentration and location of heavy metals in the sediments of Great Sippewissett Marsh and comparing my data to those collected from 1976-1980. Most metals are retained in highest concentration 8-10 cm. below the surface, although there are significant differences between high marsh and low marsh areas. Although current metal levels are higher than they were 20 years ago, the marsh appears to lose significant quantities of added metals. '"
"""The technological landscape at the end of the twentieth century provides the world of art with new challenges and inspirations. Art cannot exist in a vacuum, but must be shaped by the innovation and inspiration of technology, and, in turn, technology must take cues from art. In this multisensory compilation of art and technology, we erase the distinction between art, artist and spectator, as all three interact in infinite feedback loops of creation. The self-referential nature of this technological objet d'art enables a melding of the exhibit with the spectator: art constructed from mundane objects, and presented in an unexpected setting is so shocking that the spectator initially perceives the exhibit as commenting only on itself. Only after this first impression is made can the deeper meaning of the art be contemplated, investigating the ways in which multimedia interfaces, as we enter the twenty-first century, with our daily lives and fosters artistic expression. This project is an attempt to examine the role that emerging technologies will play in the ever-changing world of art and how we must embrace these permutations to accurately reflect our society's values and ideals."""

"""In the last century, the rise of film and visual communication gave rise to a new culture of consumerism and new attitudes of revolt against tradition. These cultural transformations are examined according to various theories of modernity that examine the public's fascination with change, novelty and visual culture (especially popular culture). The fascination with consumer goods and an increasing reverence for popular cultural idols was a central concern of a group of sociologists who are known collectively as the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. The Frankfurt School represented an attempt to reconstitute Marxism in light of the horrors of World War I and the rise of fascism in Europe. They viewed the rise of popular culture as a new form of domination. As a means to liberation, Frankfurt School theorists implored audiences to interrogate rather than passively accept visual culture and to view mass culture critically as a new instrument of cultural domination and enslavement. This presentation offers a discussion of the similarities and differences among Frankfurt School Theorists of culture and mass media and presents applications of their work to contemporary examples.

This film is about how individuals become activists, and how ordinary men and women are fighting to force our communities and our legislators to address the growing epidemic of gun violence in our state and in our country.

"I plan to explore the leadership and work of Pat Robertson in the North American Christian fundamentalist movement and in the United States religious and political arenas. I shall present background information on the Christian fundamentalist movement in order to contextualize Robertson\'s role within it as well as in U.S. politics. Today Robertson\'s name has become virtually synonymous with the ""Christian Right."" He is also strongly associated with dispensational premillennial theology, commonly known as ""end-time"" theology. I shall examine Robertson\'s writings to identify the theological views embedded in them. I shall also discuss the ways in which he fuses religion and politics, including his pioneering use of radio, television and the Internet as vehicles to promulgate his beliefs and political goals.

"During its rise to power, the Nazi Party created various written, audio and video materials including magazines, radio and TV shows and films. Forty-five years after their defeat and condemnation by the international community, Nazi ideology continues to have a following around the world. As mass media and communication technologies have advanced, various neo-Nazi groups have invested great efforts into promulgating Nazi ideology. The development of the Internet has served as a new engine for the production and dissemination of Holocaust denial, anti\xc2\xadSemitism and the politics of hate. The Internet has allowed such groups not only to spread their ideology but also to increase membership, intimidate their ""enemies"" and market and sell their merchandise. This presentation explores the emergence of this powerful new electronic ""community of hate"" and examines various responses to it. '"
"The Economics of the Performing Arts considers economic issues involved in the production and consumption of live music, theater, dance, musical theater and opera. This study focuses primarily on the organization and structure of the nonprofit sector of this industry. Questions are addressed such as: How can we classify the public/private nature of these intangible goods? What is the role of philanthropy in subsidizing these arts? What are the economic justifications for the government\'s role in promoting the production of the performing arts? What causes the ""cost disease"" that plagues the production of performing arts? This study also addresses the economic decision-making that goes on behind both the production and consumption of the performing arts. Explaining Human Rights Discourse in the Social Sciences: The Cases of Sociology, Anthropology and Political Science Jennifer Wilking \'01, Political Science '"
"This study explains how the topic of human rights has been examined historically within the academic disciplines of sociology, anthropology and political science. My research has shown that the major journals in each discipline, from 1948 to the present, exhibit great diversity in the approaches of the three social sciences to human rights. Sociology did not substantively approach the topic, work in anthropology was limited to the debate between universalism and relativism, while the approach of political science was initially a reaction to international law, and later became diversified. Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu theorizes that academic disciplines generate their own patterns of socialization and habituation of actors. This socialization and habituation is conditioned by the habitus. Examination of the history of each of the three disciplines helps us to understand how the habitus of each field conditions the behavior of the disciplines in regard to human rights. '"

"""The essence of great music...is to do the unexpected instead of the routine,"" states Paul Henry Lang. The music of the twentieth century rebelled against the constricting models of the ""traditional"" music of earlier centuries. This new music was shocking to audiences and mirrored the violent upheaval of the times, displaying a vastly different emotional intensity than the music of earlier centuries. While this ""new"" music is created from the same basic compositional elements, it shatters traditional conceptions of these elements through their non-conventional usage. According to Aaron Copland, the music of the twentieth century ""possessed a magical and evocative power"" that had never been felt before. This power evokes an intense emotional response from the audience. Come celebrate with us and take a ""break"" from tradition! '"
"""Remolding Russian Poetry"" is an attempt to elucidate and overcome the problems of making Russian poetry understandable to an English-speaking audience. Poetry, as a medium, encounters unique problems when it is translated because of its inherent formal and acoustic constraints. Rhyme and meter continue to be integral parts of Russian poetry throughout the twentieth century, long after English-language poetry dismisses these concerns. This emphasis on form, perhaps due to the innate rhyming structure of the Russian language, puts severe constraints on the translator of Russian poetry. I look at what aspects can be discarded, if at all, in a translation, and also suggest methods of adding to the original in order to enhance the poetic experience. I will make use of multimedia devices to transform the reader into a viewer, engaging sight and hearing by juxtaposing Russian and English renderings of selected poetry, conjoined with well-known classical Russian music. My subjects will be the poems of Anna Akhmatova and Marina Tsvetaeva that are especially dependent on melody and sound. In conclusion, I will also address the question of why one poet is more popularly translated than the other. '"
"In her book of poems, A Few Words in the Mother Tongue, Yiddish American poet Irena Klepfisz translates yidishkayt, or Judaism, for her American audience by employing methods of language instruction. Klepfisz creates a dictionary of Yiddish terms within her poetry, revealing the resiliency of a language that has resisted the internal collapse of assimilation and survived the external destruction of the Holocaust. Klepfisz, like many other contemporary multilingual American poets, invites audiences to participate in her linguistic reality by weaving both English and her home language (Yiddish) throughout the fabric of her poetry. Unlike other American multilingual poets of her generation, like Chicana poet Gloria Anzaldua, Klepfisz does not seek or require majority recognition to legitimize her use of language. Rather, Klepfisz calls for acknowledgement of Yiddish history and its place in the literary genre of American multilingual poetry. '"
"Jean-Paul Sartre\'s play Les Mouches (""The Flies"") is an exploration of existentialism and social contract, set against the familiar backdrop of Greek tragedy. Just as the hero and heroine, Orestes and Electra, struggle with the burden of responsibility, so too must the translator maintain a delicate balance of responsibility. In order to produce a viable, lively and above all performable translation of the play, sacrifices must be made in order to keep the text as immediate and relevant to a modern audience as it was to Sartre\'s theatergoers. But although our political, social and moral climates may be different from those of post-World War II France, the translator carries an obligation to Sartre\'s message - a message that is still as shocking now as it was 50 years ago. The actual process of translation - pure text work combined with theater workshopping - aided in resolving this crisis of a dual responsibility.'"
"While economists have actively explored the ways in which technological change affects international trade, theory suggests that international trade may in turn affect the incentives and opportunities to innovate. Since openness to international trade may promote domestic innovation for foreign markets, as well as technology transfer from abroad, there are important policy implications including the potential impact on growth. Using economic variables, this paper examines the feedback between trade and growth, testing whether trade encourages growth, particularly via technological innovation. The conclusions can be read as advice for policy-makers, including predictions about future leading countries on the technology frontier, based on the degree of openness to trade. '"

"A common misconception is that women outnumber men in the world. While this holds true for industrialized nations, there are over 40 million more men than women worldwide. Many countries, including India, China and Indonesia, have a substantial ""deficit"" of women. While there are 105 women for every 100 men in the United States, there are only 94 women for every 100 men in India. Using the concept of a ""female to male ratio"" (FMR), Amartya Sen calculated that approximately 100 million women are ""missing."" This sparked substantial publicity, but over ten years later, the question still remains about what factors cause women to die at a higher than expected rate. A reexamination of Sen\'s calculation reveals that while there are definitely ""missing women"" in some countries, Sen\'s methodology is not the best measure with which to gauge whether a country has a ""missing women"" problem. Analysis of demographic trends provides insight on how women ""disappear."" '"
"""The pornography of an era reflects the era's sexual ideal or fantasy. As the political atmosphere of the period becomes more restrictive or permissive, the fantasy of the era moves in the same direction. In Russia over the last century a pattern of rapid alternations between fantasies of repressed and unconstrained sexuality parallels the country's movement from political anarchy, to communism, to glasnost and the postcommunist era. This pattern and the divide between sexual fantasy and practice are explained in relation to Freud's theories of sexual repression and the creation of society. """
"Over the course of American military history, the U.S. Army has had a gendered ideology which contrasts masculinity in soldiers with femininity in those the soldiers ""defend."" Gender has been manipulated by the government and military to rally support for military actions, as is the case of the Spanish American War. History has also brought changes in gender structure, however, as when the Line between the ""front"" and the ""homefront"" blurred during the American Civil War. In this century, there have come to be more Army career opportunities for women than ever before. However, these changes have raised an issue of whether there is a limit to how much alteration of gender ideology the military can absorb without losing its ability to function. '"
"""The goddess Persephone's screams are heard as Hades, God of the Underworld, carries her off to be his bride. Whereas Sophocles' Antigone laments her tomb which will also serve as her bridal bed. The juxtaposition of marriage and death is ubiquitous throughout much of ancient literature. Marriage in literature is suffused with tension, resistance to leaving maidenhood and the desire to be wife and mother. For fifth century Attic drama, instead of symbolizing new beginning, marriage connotes death. I will show the literary trope not only offers evidence for aspects of ancient marriage customs and funerary rites, which often overlap, but also comments on societal expectations of young women. Epigraphic sources and art works from antiquity confirm the significance of these rites and expectations. The linen noose Antigone hangs herself with simultaneously alludes to a bridal veil and the shroud for a corpse, linking two polarities in life and causing us to examine their meaning for ancient women.

"""The Fall of Miletus and The Phoenissae by Phrynichus and The Persians by Aeschylus were the only three plays in Greek literature which addressed contemporary historical events, and all three describe defeat in war. Why did these Greek playwrights choose to place such an emphasis on the plight of the defeated? The guilt-inducing Fall of Miletus (now lost) so outraged the Athenians that they fined the playwright. Only a few lines of The Phoenissae survive, but Aeschylus is said to have based his still-extant play on it. The Persians celebrates an incredible Greek victory, yet, told from the point of view of the defeated Persians, this play about triumph assumes the trappings of tragedy. By comparing these plays to Euripides' Trojan Women and Hecuba, I suggest that these plays which praised the victors also served to warn them that the winners, celebrated now, will someday be the losers, pitied later.

"Ever since Euclid set down the first five postulates of formal geometry, high school students everywhere have been told to accept them as truth, the geometry of the world. Do the postulates, in fact, give an adequate representation of the physical universe? We contend that they do not. In fact, Euclid himself doubted the truth of the fifth axiom (which states that there exists exactly one parallel line through a point not on a given line), ironically making himself the first non-Euclidean geometer. Euclid\'s suspicions were correct, as the existence of hyperbolic and elliptical geometries shows. We will take a closer look at these two non-Euclidean geometries and their relevance to modern understanding of the nature of the physical universe. As we look at these two ""non-Euclidean"" geometries, we will present different models in which these two geometries exist. '"
"Every driver can describe the horrors of sitting in a traffic jam, including the noisy honking of neighboring cars, the fear of being late and the escalating road rage that even the most amusing of radio DJs cannot placate. What can be done about these irritating events? The first question to examine, and the focus of this presentation, is the underlying cause of traffic jams. Through the use of a computer simulation, the flow of a one-Jane highway can be easily studied by applying a few simple conditions. Parameters of this system include a set speed limit, road length and car length. Variables include the probability of cars slowing down and driver reaction time. Initially, cars are spaced along the road. Each car is randomly assigned a speed (under the speed limit - no speed demons allowed!). Based upon the space they have in front of them, cars either progress at their assigned speed or at the maximum speed possible without hitting the car in front of them. The simulation shows that, contrary to popular belief, traffic jams are not solely caused by accidents or stalled cars. They are inherent in a road with a critical number of cars. '"
"Two familiar phase transitions, vapor to water and water to ice, occur at very specific temperatures. When a bar magnet (a ferromagnetic material) is heated, it will undergo a phase transition at a particular temperature and will lose its magnetism. The goal of this study is to simulate the phase transition in a ferromagnet using a Monte Carlo method. Our model is a square lattice in which a mini-magnet exists at each lattice site. These mini-magnets interact only with their immediate neighbors, and their natural desire is to point in the same direction. At low temperatures, the mini-magnets tend to be aligned, producing a ferromagnet. As temperature reaches a critical point, these mini-magnets abruptly lose their alignment, leaving the material non-magnetic (a phase transition has occurred). This simulation helps us to understand why phase transitions occur. '"
"""Mary M.

CGP was extracted from the cells with 0.1 N HCl after each time interval and subjected to \'H NMR spectroscopy. A high ""N:,.N ratio was seen in the spectra of cells from the later time periods.

"Mary M. Allen, Biological Sciences Cyanophycin is a nitrogen reserve material that accumulates during environmentally stressful conditions in cyanobacteria. The synthesis and degradation of cyanophycin are under study in our laboratory using experiments in which cells are grown under different culture conditions and cyanophycin is analyzed by \'H NMR spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. Cells were treated with chloramphenicol alone or with low light and chloramphenicol, and cyanophycin was isolated at different times after treatment. NMR spectroscopy showed an immediate increase in the amount of cyanophycin; the nitrogen in cyanophycin originated both from the medium and cellular protein breakdown. Cells repleted with ""N-nitrate in the presence of chloramphenicol in high light showed cyanophycin with 50% ""N in 2.5 hours, while cells with ""N-nitrate and chloramphenicol in low light showed 50% ""N by 15 hours. SOS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibody raised to purified cyanophycin showed an increase in cyanophycin molecular weight after cells were treated with chloramphenicol and low light.

"Mary M. Allen, Biological Sciences We have been studying proteases induced in cyanobacteria in response to nitrogen starvation and other stresses. Specifically, we have been examining the relationship between proteases produced following nitrogen starvation and refeeding, and proteins involved in the synthesis and degradation of the nitrogen-storage molecule cyanophycin. The cyanobacteria studied included strain 6803 and two mutants, each of which is missing a protein: One of these lacks the protease to break down cyanophycin, while the other lacks the synthetase to make cyanophycin. Each of the three strains was starved for nitrogen for several days and refed with nitrate. The cells were allowed to grow for varying amounts of time and then harvested. In another series of experiments, proteases were induced by stress with high salt. The proteins induced by this process in each strain were then analyzed with casein zymogram gels and NMR techniques.

"Mary M. Allen, Biological Sciences Our research focused on finding the optimal growth medium for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6308. In our laboratory, cyanobacteria have typically been fed nitrate as its nitrogen source; however, we wanted to determine if this strain would grow better if ammonium chloride was provided instead. We hypothesized that the cyanobacteria would grow better with this nitrogen source, because it is known that ammonium enters most cells and is directly utilized, whereas when cells are fed nitrate, it must be converted into nitrite, and then ammonium, before it is utilized. The amount of growth and pH of the medium were monitored; growth curves and growth yields were plotted. The buffer TES was used because ammonium chloride is acidic; experiments were also carried out to determine the buffering capacity of TES. Results indicate that TES is not a good buffer under our conditions and that the optimal ammonium concentration is 4 mM. (Research supported by NSF AIRE, NSF RUI and HHMI grants.) '"

"""Historically, Wellesley College, like most of our country's liberal arts colleges, has educated a relatively homogenous, white, and upper-income elite.

One strategy for attracting students from diverse backgrounds has been the production of recruiting materials geared to their perceived needs and desires. A content analysis of admissions materials from the early 1970s through the present clearly demonstrates the different strategies of recruiting students, and a comparison between minority and general-audience brochures during each period serves to emphasize the College's perceived concerns of potential Wellesley women. These materials greatly affect students' expectations regarding their college experiences, and thus provide an interesting area of analysis. """

"Culture, according to sociocultural anthropologists, is the set of ideas, behaviors and practices that help humans to order and interact with their environment. Race is a socially constructed concept associated with - but not inherent in - phenotypical markers. In theory, ""culture"" is different from ""race,"" but in practice these concepts are both ""place-bound"": located in space such that cultures and races are believed to be ""from"" specific places. This uncritical association naturalizes certain categories of identity and difference and obscures the arbitrariness of the social relations that these uphold. Moreover, a place-bound concept of culture results in efforts to foster ""multiculturalism"" without truly interrogating the underlying assumptions (Gupta and Ferguson 1992). This presentation extends this critique of place-bound notions of ""culture"" to the concept of ""race."" Providing evidence from fieldwork conducted at Wellesley College, I argue that reconceptualizing these categories has practical implications for current understandings of racism and multiculturalism.

"People with gender identities that do not match their biological sex are greatly misunderstood. While evidence suggests that gender identity is innate, not a choice or a consequence of an unhealthy childhood, the transgendered are accused of being immoral and maladjusted. Such negative stereotyping reinforces anti\xc2\xadtransgender sentiments leading to acts of violence, scant coverage by the media, and insufficient laws to protect victims. Even law enforcement agencies fail to recognize hate crimes against the transgendered community by either not recording incidents as hate crimes or by misrepresenting the victims as homosexual. As a result, transgendered victims are virtually absent from hate crime statistics. By including the term ""gender identity and expression"" in the definition of sexual,, orientation in hate crime statutes, hate crimes against transgendered individuals would be more likely to receive the concern they deserve, and offenders would be subject to the enhanced penalties outlined by these laws.

"""Betsy Wheeler was thirteen in 1806 when her father Ephraim Wheeler raped her. The court case and execution that followed from that act open a window into the vast complexities associated with rape in early New England.

It forced New England's leaders, meanwhile, to consider what happened when the rules that were supposed to preserve social order failed.

Rape offers a glimpse of what happened when New Englanders, who lived in a society strictly controlled by rules and regulations, had to deal with a situation that flagrantly broke the social norms of the time."""

"Over the past fifty years, American Jews in noticeable numbers have become involved in Buddhism. More than any other cultural group, Jews have left their tradition for or included in their own tradition Buddhist practices. Through research and extensive interviews with these individuals, commonly known as ""JUBUs,"" we hope to demystify this phenomenon and understand the developing identities of these individuals as both Jews and Buddhists. We hypothesize that the cultural, rather than religious, nature of American Jewry makes this Jewish population more open to adopting aspects of Buddhist doctrine and practice without giving up their Jewish heritage, culture or identity. As eastern philosophy, including Buddhism, entered America, it became westernized and Americanized. We predict that this adapted form of Buddhism is the form practiced by these individuals. Our hypothesis is that the focus of this westernized Buddhism on meditation and personal spiritual journey compliments American, modern Jewish thought and practice. '"

To identify the policies and conditions that lead to better protection of the human rights of girls and women, I comparatively study Afghan refugees in Iran and Pakistan. Specifically, I examine why some indicators of female empowerment in the host population are strong indicators of effective protections and opportunities for female refugees.

"Since the mid-sixth-century AD Confucian and Buddhist conceptions of ideal womanhood influenced the creation of limited and defined gender roles for women in Japan. Elderly Japanese women of the twenty-first century face not only the feminist challenge to traditional female role expectations, but also changes in and shortages of physical and psychological support from family, elderly communities, professional care providers and spiritual communities. When aging women encounter the role-shift from caregiver to care-receiver, they may enjoy liberation and independence or struggle with isolation. Advocacy for women as equal members of the Buddhist community and teachers of the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha) continues to grow, signaling tremendous potential to create future spaces for contemplation, practice and support for elderly women. The female Bodhisattva of Compassion, an enlightened being who chooses to come back to this world to help others, provides Buddhist women with a positive spiritual redeemer/guide for their own lives from womb to tomb as mothers, friends, listeners and liberators.

"""Recent findings suggest that perceptions of visual stimuli may vary by culture. For example, individuals from cultures that emphasize an independent view of self are likely to perceive objects separately from the context in which they are embedded and to communicate information about objects through the use of direct and succinct language. By contrast, members of interdependent cultures are highly attuned to contextual cues and are likely to utilize background information to describe objects and to use indirect and elaborate language. This study explored the effect of low - versus high - context on preschoolers' perception of visual stimuli. The data suggest that children who predominantly speak English or Spanish in their home may perceive stimuli in a culture-specific manner. Although preliminary, these findings suggest that perception of visual stimuli may vary among preschool children in predictable ways. This may have implications for our understanding of cognitive development among young children."""
"""The purpose of this study is to compare the cultural values of Japan and the United States through an analysis of the themes presented in children's textbooks. Stories will be sampled from Japanese and American elementary-school language textbooks. First, the themes present in each story will be rated and analyzed for their reflection of collectivistic or individualistic cultural values. Second, specific details in the stories will also be coded. It is hypothesized that stories in American textbooks will reflect more individualistic cultural values than Japanese stories, while Japanese stories will reflect more collectivistic cultural values than American stories. It is also hypothesized that American stories will take place in a wide range of locations, have fewer characters and have more clear-cut, happy endings. The implication of results in relation to previously established theories and findings will be discussed. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship) """
"The Mexican crisis of 1994 and the East Asian crisis of 1997 are prime examples of financial difficulties that occur in one country and then spread to other countries in the same region and, in some cases, to other regions. In the economics literature this process of rapidly, and widely, spreading financial panic is known as ""contagion."" While crises tend to originate in countries with vulnerable domestic fundamentals, the spread of the crisis may be caused by external factors such as common stocks, trade linkages, financial linkages and pure contagion. This study examines the causes underlying the origination and spread of crises in currency markets, stock markets and money markets. The sample consists of 45 emerging markets and covers a 20-year period from 1980 to 1999. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship)'"
"""The goal of this project is to elucidate the cellular basis of self recognition. Apoptotic cells are a possible means by which the immune system recognizes self antigen. Dendritic cells (DCs) that are capable of taking up apoptotic cells directly interact with T cells, which are involved in cell- mediated immune response. Reactions in vitro show proliferation of CDS + T cells after treatment with DCs and apoptotic cells. Cytotoxic lysis assays of these killer T cells exhibited antigen specific lysis of target cells. These results, along with immunoassays of cytokine release, suggest that although induction of killer T cells occurs, proliferation of activated cells may result in a minor immune response. Parallel in vivo experiments with fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis support these results. Future T cell tracking experiments in mice will reveal more '\xc2\xb7 about the nature of self antigen presentation within the body.

"AtABPl was recently discovered and isolated in this laboratory, and found to contain a region of homology to the yeast protein Secl4p. Secl4p transfers phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylcholine between membranes and is essential for Golgi-associated protein secretion. We hypothesized that AtABPl also binds phospholipids. AtABPl was expressed and purified from E.coli and an assay using phospholipid vesicles was developed to characterize its binding activity. Binding to a range of Pl mono-, bi- and tri-phosphate derivatives was also tested using a ""fat blot"" assay. AtABPl was found to bind most strongly to PI-3-P and Pl-5-P, with some binding to other PI derivatives. Since Pl-3-P is required for the formation of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles and AtABPl is located at the cell plate, AtABPl may link the actin cytoskeleton to the Golgi and play an important role in the vesicle trafficking required for cell division.

"The chloroplast movement of Arabidopsis thaliana is studied by exposing leaf samples to blue light. The samples are first dark-adapted to achieve the face position in which the chloroplasts are aligned perpendicular to the light. The transmission of weak red light through the leaf is monitored using a helium-neon laser. The transmission level through the leaf is measured with a photodiode. After blue light exposure, chloroplasts achieve the profile position in which they are lined up parallel to the light and therefore achieve maximum transmission of red light. An increase of 30% in transmission is observed. In previous studies, however, the transmission rate increased by roughly a factor of 2. Different factors of the experiment will be manipulated in order to maximize the transmission of the leaf due to exposure to blue light. '"
"""Over the past few decades, technology has advanced so greatly in medicine that the expected lifespan is now much longer than previously. Recently, new ways to analyze data have been developed and utilized that doctors can understand more about a person's condition and prognosis. The field of nonlinear mathematics and its analytical methods has turned out to be one of the most useful tools in many fields of medicine, including cardiology. Research has shown that nonlinear mathematics may often give much more information about a person's condition than conventional methods. With the use of this theory, doctors can measure heart rate variability and can use the results to predict whether a person is going to go into heart failure or have other fatal problems. 1 will explain the idea behind Chaos Theory and how doctors and mathematicians can use Chaos Theory in order to better predict patients' prognoses.

"The process of conceptual combination involves generating a novel image or meaning from a head/modifier noun pair, such as ""zebra bag"". Studies in normal individuals have found that the predominant type of response is property-based: a property of the modifier, such as a zebra\'s stripes, is mapped onto the head noun, resulting in an interpretation such as ""a bag with black and white stripes."" The majority of the remaining responses are relational, such as interpreting ""zebra trap"" as ""a trap used to capture zebras."" This study applied a conceptual combination paradigm to a group of schizophrenic subjects. We were interested in how response types for this group would differ from those of normal individuals, between low and high levels of thought disorder, and whether the degree of contextual constraint in the noun pairs would influence that relationship. The results of this study have implications for the nature of language processing in thought-disordered individuals and the mechanisms underlying conceptual combination. '"

"""Yarrowia lipolytica is a 'non-conventional,' eukaryotic yeast. It is dimorphic, having the ability to switch between a filamentous form of growth and a yeast form of growth. Dimorphism is a characteristic shared by many pathogenic yeasts and Y. lipolytica has been reported to cause infections in the blood of immunocompromised patients. These findings support earlier suggestions that Y. lipolytica is an emerging opportunisitic pathogen. Since little is known about Y. lipolytica dimorphism, our lab is interested in exploring the genetic and physiological responses of Y. lipolytica as it undergoes a dimorphic switch. This panel will present information on how different mutagenesis strategies have been employed to identify genes involved in dimorphism. The presumptive genetic, physiological and structural roles of the candidate genes isolated will also be discussed. """

"""ls Tahiti really Paradise? A terrestrial Paradise is impossible, yet the French explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville portrayed Tahiti as a veritable Garden of Eden. He spent barely a week on the island in 1768, but went on to write one of the most influential descriptions of it. In fact, much of the picture of Tahiti that de Bougainville portrayed still lingers today. In this paper I will address de Bougainville's representation of Tahiti and the manner in which he glosses over negative impressions of the culture in order to sustain this utopian picture. Bougainville's utopian image of Tahiti is constructed through a narrative which becomes the point of intersection of important discourses that articulate various forces such as, the colonial enterprise, rivalry between the French and British """
"The Injustice Done to Tau Ngo, a Chinese supernatural play from the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), describes the tale of a condemned woman who in death fights to clear her name. In an attempt to save her mother-in-law, Tou Ngo is falsely accused of a murder and sentenced to death; thus, at her execution, Tou Ngo can only call upon heaven and hell as witnesses of her innocence. One can see how these themes remain relevant even today. I am working on a contemporary adaptation of this seven-hundred-year-old play.

"Recent anecdotal and statistical evidence suggests an increased frequency in oral sex among heterosexual adolescents. While health risks relative to intercourse are unclear, the social climate and individual meaning of this behavior is highly salient to adolescents. Data on sexual health were gathered through a literature review of popular and academic literature for the past twelve years and a subset (n = 72 interviewed) of participants from a longitudinal study (n = 281 surveyed) as they progressed from middle to high school. Content analysis was used for analyzing these data. Popular literature focused on girls\' oral sexual behavior as sensational, while mention of boys\' oral sexual behavior was predominantly limited to factual reporting. The interviews revealed increased apprehension among female adolescents regarding oral sexual behavior (fellatio), predominantly due to the social risk of labels such as ""chickenhead"" and ""pigeon"", while boys felt they gained higher status among their peers for having had oral sex.

"Diabetes is a disease in which patients provide their own day-to-day care, so patient education plays a dramatic role in determining outcomes for patients with diabetes. I collaborated on a study that aimed to identify factors that hindered the successful self-management of Type 2 diabetes in patients served by a hospital clinic. The interviews with patients documented startling informational gaps: Patients who used glucometers to monitor and record their blood glucose values did not know how to interpret the results that they recorded and some did not even know what their target values were. What could explain this? I hypothesize that patients generally receive their most comprehensive diabetes training at their diagnoses, and this is not updated as treatment options and technologies evolve. The new frontier in medicine is the successful integration of patient education with new technologies and the fostering of collaborative relationships between patients and health care providers. '"

"Nerve cells (neurons) are unique cells within the body because in adulthood they have a very limited potential for regeneration. Without regrowth, the nervous system has a limited capacity for recovery after injury and cell death, which makes diseases of the nervous system particularly devastating. One of the most exciting discoveries in neuroscience in the last decade is that neurons in the adult nervous system do have some capacity for proliferation. This discovery has spawned extensive research into the multitude of factors that control cell birth (neurogenesis) and cell death. In this session, we will explore neuronal birth and death in invertebrate and vertebrate animal models. Specific topics will include how circadian rhythms and sex hormones influence neurogenesis throughout the life of the animal. These findings have implications for disorders of the nervous system as diverse as schizophrenia, brain metastasis of cancer and spinal cord injury.

"The synthesis of a series of potentially biologically active nucleosides involves ribosidation at the N-4 position of 1,2,4-triazole (1). Our work has focused on developing a methodology for this selective N-4 ribosidation. Direct chemical ribosidation of 1,2,4-triazole (1) at the N-4 position has not previously been reported. When an electrophilic substituent is added to 1,2,4-triazole (1), it is placed at the undesired N-1 position. Previous work has shown that the substitution of a sulfur at the C-3 position of 1,2,4-triazole (1) to form 1,2,4-triazolin-3-thione (2) activates the N-4 position. Therefore, we are working on various strategies utilizing C-3 S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles. Once the ribose group is added on to 1,2,4-triazole (1) at the desired N-4 position, we will then remove the C-3 substituent to obtain our desired product. The resulting product will then be subjected to other chemistry being developed in our lab for N-4 substituted 1,2,4-triazoles. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship) '"
"Nucleoside analogs have been shown to exhibit chemotherapeutic and anti-viral effects in the body.

"""The enzyme thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is important in the metabolism of several biologically-active peptides. A modified version of TOP, with one negatively\xc2\xadcharged amino acid residue changed to a neutral one, was found to have decreased activity toward natural substrates but increased activity toward artificial substrates. This suggested that the negative residue is in the binding site of the enzyme, interfering with the binding of negatively-charged groups on the artificial substrate but essential for binding positively-charged groups on the natural substrate. We have previously shown that positively-charged metal ions increase TOP's activity toward artificial substrates, perhaps by neutralizing the charge on either substrate or enzyme. In testing the activity of the enzyme in the presence of these metal ions, both the natural and modified enzymes had increased activity toward the artificial substrate and decreased activity toward the natural substrate. The negative residue may play a role in the binding of substrates to TOP. (Research supported by the Dreyfus Foundation; NSF-REU; Howard Hughes Medical Institute)"""
"Some nucleoside analogs have practical use as enzyme inhibitors. This is our motivation in proposing a new series of nucleoside analogs.

"Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is an enzyme that cleaves short neuropeptides. Unlike most enzymes, it is activated by dithio\xc2\xadthreitol (OTT), an agent which breaks S-S bonds. These bonds are formed by neighboring cysteine residues. TOP contains several cysteine residues on its surface, and the enzyme can form dimers when S\xc2\xadS bonds form between them. When this happens, activity is lower. Several mutant forms of TOP have been made in which either one or two of these surface cysteines have been mutated so as to prevent S-S bond formation. Two of the mutants (one with modification at Cys 46 and one with modification at Cys 682 and 687) were separated into their monomeric and dimeric form and the activity was tested. The results indicate that dimerization through one side of the enzyme decreases its activity, while dimerization through the opposite side has little effect.'"

"""The introduction of the automobile into American society caused great cultural changes, including the development of roadside architecture and literary road narratives in the 1930s and the 19SOs. In a parallel to Frederick Jackson Turner's myth of the frontier, automobiles created new cultural frontiers for Americans to explore during these two decades. The development of roadside institutions -such as gas stations, touring camps, motels, restaurants, drive-in movies and fast food restaurants - as well as the social history of American attitudes toward them, provides important historical context for two important American literary works of these decades, The Grapes of Wrath and Lolita. Careful readings of these texts reveal the changing American roadside and these authors' developing conceptions of America. The nostalgia surrounding road trips and roadside culture in America today shows the importance of these developments, as Americans today try to preserve the disappearing roadside institutions of the 1930s and 1950s.

"Anton Dvorak, a prominent Romantic composer of the late nineteenth century, is recognized for the Czech nationalism in his music. Born in a Bohemian village, he suffused his works with folklike tunes and the popular dance rhythms of his culture. His flair for portraying geocultural elements is further exemplified by his ""American Quartet,"" composed while residing in the United States. Dvorak\'s style is beloved for its joyousness. The freshness and gaiety that spring forth from his works are without parallel in Western music. The Piano Quintet Op. 81 perfectly illustrates also the sensuous happiness and nostalgia that emerge from his evocation of country life. After bursting with a fiery, spirited allegro movement, the second one derives from a European melancholic folk ballad, the Dumka. The third movement gives an impression of happy provincial life, and the final movement bustles with rich interflowing melodies. In Dvorak\'s music it is easy to see how the simple, rustic folktunes work so well as joyous music; the vitality of folk music is a celebration of man\'s traditions of community which Dvorak brings to the level of nationalism. Another remarkable feature of the work is the equal importance of each part: with Dvorak\'s fertility of inventions there are many intoxicating melodies to be shared and enjoyed by everybody.'"

In my works, the burr becomes a vehicle to express an uneasy yet passionate relationship between self and the environment, between self and spirit, between self and family. I present the results of my sustained and intense interrogation not only of a natural object, but also of human identity in a threatening ecological or social space.'"
"My work consists of five cigarette boxes three times enlarged from the actual size in different states of assemble. This work turned two-dimensional prints into a three-dimensional structure. The images on the cigarette boxes are that of shoes, flat geometrical shapes, butterflies, snakes and text that are relief-hand printed. What we perceive about the things around us are not entirely true since there are always tricks that can deceive our perception. ""Butter lies"" - ""Lies"" as smooth as butter - can be one of these deceptions, while it can simply be a typo of ""butterflies."" The texts on my work can be read in different tones and have multiple meanings. Both creatures, a butterfly and a snake, do not seem to have much in common, but both have to shed their skin in order to change or grow. My work expresses a hope to shed the skin of deceptions and try to see the real truth.'"
"""This study examined how fiction might shape children's stereotypes of specific environmental settings. We conducted a content analysis of fiction that, between 1975-2001, won either the Newbery award (given by the American Library Association for distinguished contributions to children's literature) or the Coretta Scott King award (given to a distinguished children's book by an author of African descent). The themes examined included the main physical setting of the novel, the occurrence of threats from weather, the evaluative depiction of nature, the environmental competence of the central character, and the presence or absence of environmental issues (e.g., overpopulation, pollution.) We also compared the winners of the two prizes on the type of main setting. Preliminary findings suggest there is some bias regarding how various places are presented: urban and rural settings are over-represented, negative aspects of urban settings are emphasized and weather-related threats are associated with small town and rural settings.

"This study is concerned with family story\xc2\xadtelling, the stories which family members tell each other about their histories and lives, as well as the histories and lives of extended family members and ancestors. One research question is the content of such stories. A second question is whether the content is related to aspects of family dynamics - for example, the degree of family cohesion or the values that families stress. Undergraduate females completed several standard questionnaires measuring family relationships and dynamics. In addition, each wrote two stories. One story described an event or episode involving family members that the participant felt best exemplified her family. A second story was one that she had been told by others regarding an event or episode involving family members (but which she did not experience herself). These stories are being content analyzed and the content will be related to various dimensions of family dynamics.

Their psychoses result in numerous explosive as well as subtle clashes with the world, each other, and their two girls, Clay and Lacy. The challenge has been to write from inside the minds of Bertram and Helen in an effort to help the reader ""see"" and ""feel"" what it\'s like to ""inhabit"" their ""realities.""

"Presenting a selection from my Creative Writing Honors Thesis, I will read from a collection of meditations on the sea. The following is excerpted from an essay entitled ""The Windsurfer."" ""She rounded the curve near the ocean\'s edge and spotted something in the water. It appeared to be a black trash bag, flotsam being hurled back and forth in the tide. Climbing down the steep bank, she investigated. A man in a wet suit floated in the foam. Terrified, she stumbled up the rocky shore, calling for help. At first the neighbors didn\'t notice. A beach is a noisy place, where yells of children echo as they jump the waves or play games in the sand. However, her persistent screams finally alerted neighbors who rushed to the seashore. Two men pulled the battered body of a windsurfer from the water. He was dead.""'"
"""Mud is a collection of poems written and edited over a period of two years. It is the poetic documentation of an exploration - it is the author's attempt to answer questions about poetry, story-telling and autobiography. Where do stories originate? Is it possible to write without the influence of personal experiences? Can writing ever be completely fiction, can it ever be without the lingering presence of autobiography, and if so, is it any good? By examining the processes through which each part of Mud was produced, from word choice to paper and script type of the limited edition printing, and then taking in a reading of the poems by the author, we discover the true dimensionality of poetry that is more than just the written word, but also performance, and art."""
"This presentation will consist of excerpts from essays written by four students in WRIT 225, nonfiction writing, last summer. The focus of the course was the personal essay, and to encourage creativity we were given a great deal of freedom in choosing topics to write about. Despite this latitude, it was striking how as the summer progressed we all circled back to the same themes: that of our relationships to and our conceptions of home, family, self and mortality. We came into the course from very different backgrounds - an American, a Romanian, a Japanese\xc2\xadAmerican and a Bangladeshi - yet the stories we share evoke a hauntingly familiarity of shared nostalgia, hope, fear, sorrow and joy. This is the story of these remarkable connections explored through the personal essay. '"
"The European Union\'s Common Agricultural Policy sets internal prices for goods such as grains, dairy products, wine, olive oil and beef. The prices are much higher than world prices, meaning that consumers and taxpayers transfer huge sums to farmers annually. After World War II, fresh memories of shortages and starvation motivated this plan to ensure supply, but today there is no longer a need to promote self-sufficiency at such a cost. The CAP is an outdated policy that threatens the EU\'s future. The budgetary pressures of the CAP must be sharply reduced before the EU enlarges to the east. If the CAP is not drastically reformed, the EU will not be able to afford to fully integrate the new members into the EU. Excluding the new members from the CAP will set a dangerous precedent of ""Europe a la carte,"" which will result in increased instability and internal conflict. '"
"The current international monetary system, since the collapse of the Bretton\xc2\xadWoods system, is based on three pillars - monetary policy sovereignty, flexible exchange rates and free movement of capital. It is, however, at the cost of highly volatile exchange rates, particularly at short-term horizons. Short-term exchange rate behavior has remained a puzzle in international finance. This paper constructs a theoretical model that combines models from the finance and economics literature to explain empirical findings. The model evolves from a multi\xc2\xadfactor affine model, applies the pricing kernel hypothesis to exchange rate movement in continuous-time form, and discusses the special cases where two countries have symmetric/asymmetric mutual influences. Employing continuous\xc2\xadtime framework and allowing for asymmetric interaction cross the border, the new exchange rate model is able to show that the forward premium anomaly is indeed normal and that non-linearities in exchange rate behavior can result from country asymmetry.

With tourism comes waste generated by humans and the cruise ships that carry them to their destinations, and it is likely that each person will be affected by the waste discharge pollution. International pollution standards for ships have been set; however, for eight randomly selected countries, political, economic and environmental factors vary and must be examined in order to identify the overall effectiveness of regulations from protecting the marine environment against polluters.

"In contemporary U.S. culture, a damaging contradiction between a sentimental valuing of motherhood, and the economic reality facing many mothers, threatens to extend the poverty of these mothers. Drawing partially on the work of Ann Crittendon, whose findings indicate that women pay a high price for choosing to be mothers, this sociocultural analysis considers the difficulties faced by three categories of mothers: full time married mothers working only at home, married mothers performing part-time outside work and single working mothers. The question is raised: why does our culture allow those individuals whom we most admire (mothers) also to be at greatest risk for poverty? Possible answers lie in the rhetoric of motherhood, and in the social conventions that serve to maintain the status of mothers in relation to men and children. '"
"""Male or Female? Choosing the sex of your child is a novel idea that is more easily attainable than ever before. In the United States and India there are multiple ways to decide the sex of your child. Pre-conceptive selection, embryonic selection and post-conceptive selection are three possible methods. The United States and India are not only different in their populations, cultures, and medical venues, but also in the ethical arguments which surround sex\xc2\xadselection. Gendercide, as sex-selection is sometimes called, is entirely immersed in ethical debate, highlighted especially by feminist ethics and cultural relativism. Are the ethical debates different for each country's support of sex-selection? Should the ethical arguments be different? Why is sex-selection of fetuses such an ethical dilemma? These questions are explored as parents from both countries continue to pick and choose between the X and Y chromosomes of their offspring. """

"""Peggy Guggenheim's story as a patron of the arts, a poor scion of the prominent Smelting family, an expatriate, a Jew, a business woman and a liberated woman is not easily placed in history - and even more so, because she chose to spend the last portion of it in Venice. To her biographers, and even in her autobiographies, Peggy Guggenheim's life in Venice appears as the epilogue to an already completed and noteworthy existence. Yet it is through the prowess of the eccentric dowager who lived in Venice that the rest of Peggy Guggenheim's story is held together and of consequence. During her time in Venice, Peggy's identity became synonymous with prowess of her collection - a synthesis that she cultivated the most ardently in Venice. Peggy did not retire to Venice; Peggy completed herself - the myth of herself - in Venice. By adding the epilogue of Venice to her career as a patron, Peggy made her story unique, thus ensuring its place in history. It is through the image of Peggy Guggenheim that Peggy projected in Venice that history views the earlier, and equally juicy parts of her life. """
"Two simple words, ""Never forget,"" surface in almost every Holocaust museum and memorial. Indeed, most agree that we have a moral obligation to remember the Holocaust, and to pay tribute to the victims of the Nazi state. Many would argue that we also have an obligation to educate future generations about the evils and legacies of National Socialism. From Poland to Israel, and even here in the United States, communities have wrestled with how to remember best the past and educate for the future. My studies of Holocaust history and my visit to several Holocaust sites both here and in Europe have illuminated the importance and complexity of Holocaust memory and education, a subject which raises difficult and painful questions but offers few clear answers. My presentation will assess the design and function of selected Holocaust museums and memorials as they endeavor to address the challenges these questions pose.'"

"The spread of AIDS and the transmission of HIV, constitutes one of the most prolific and frightening pandemic of our time. In the United States, as of 1997, one third of all new HIV infections were transmitted through the sharing of contaminated needles and syringes. Needle exchange programs target this high-risk group of intravenous drug users and attempt to curtail the epidemic by supplying clean hypodermic needles and syringes in exchange for used contaminated needles. Advocates propose that this reduces the transmission of HIV by reducing the risk of sharing contaminated needles. However, opponents feel that NEPs perpetuates the pandemic, exacerbating the problem by supplying addicts with a steady supply of needles. Both arguments will be evaluated in determining the efficacy of NEPs. Such programs have been implemented in Europe as well as the U.S., with various factors such as politics, ethical issues and funding influencing their performances. '"

"""Transcription is a noble art; besides being a phenomenal pianist and composer, Franz Liszt was famous for his numerous transcriptions of orchestral and vocal works for piano solo. In MUS 300: Instrumental and Transcription, we learned to transcribe music that we loved but was not written for our own instrument. In order to complete our transcription projects, we studied instrumentation, the fundamentals of the piece of music we were transcribing, the balance and architecture of the music; the range, playing techniques and colors of individual instruments that we were writing for; and the interplay between them. This knowledge needed to be internalized within our musical understanding in order for us to make successful transcriptions. By working on these projects, all of us have greatly improved our musicianship. We have gained familiarity with different instruments as well as the pieces of music we transcribed. Our final projects reflect our personal tastes: Jane Hyoun-ju Park transcribed Frank Martin's Agnus Dei (originally for double SATB choir) for organ and string quartet. Yuko Shimokawa transcribed Beethoven's Egmont Overture (for orchestra) for her chamber music group, a piano quintet. Patricia Diaz transcribed Solo e Pensoso, an Italian madrigal by Luca Marenzio based on a Petrarch sonnet (originally for five voices) for flute, piano and two trombones.

In Ancient Rome, food and dining practices served to establish, reinforce and maintain the power relationships between the elite and the others. Strict rules governed who was invited to a banquet, where they sat, how they behaved and what they ate; differentiated cuisine and treatment based on social status was a hallmark of Roman dining. Convivia, with its emphasis on ""living together,"" was an ideal opportunity for Rome\'s elite to demonstrate their wealth, authority and power. '"
"Although women have always had a place in the domestic kitchen, they have had less glory in obtaining recognition as chefs in large restaurant kitchens.

They have had to overcome several multifaceted obstacles regarding how professional kitchens and restaurants are run. Major assumptions that women have had to battle include a prejudice against the required physical work of a chef, the desire for a family that inhibits long hours, an inferior level of taste sensitivity, a ""personal"" connection to the food, and a lack of necessary business and organizational skills. These biases are unjust, and many women\'s experiences are documented and discussed here, with a purpose to show that women, too, can ""kick it up a notch!"" '"
"""By the time Lolita was translated into French (Eric Kahane, 1959), Vladimir Nabokov had tired of l'affaire Lolita. He only hurriedly looked over the proofs for the translation, leaving it riddled with textual inconsistencies. Nabokov was multilingual, and he carefully chose the narrative language for each of his novels, especially the American English of Lolita. American life, culture, landscape and language fascinated Nabokov, and Lolita is as much a testament to this fascination as it is a love story or a murder mystery. There is no doubt that Nabokov carefully crafted Lolita as a multileveled masterpiece, and that the story cloaks many different layers of meaning. In examining the French translation I suggest that there was some manipulation of the novel's content as it changed languages - some of the novel's layers were subtracted deliberately, some were lost in translation, yet others were purposely added.

In an era where passenger planes crash into urban skyscrapers, where bombs and wheat rain upon a single country, and where civilians are caught at random by the dissemination of a murderous white powder, the once fantastic subject of the absurdist writer becomes eerily familiar to contemporary audiences. An examination of two strains of Absurdism that emerged in response to the mechanisms of mid-twentieth-century war makes manifest an ominous foretelling - and possible warning - for the coming millennium.

"""In the early 1930s, Mexican architect Juan O'Gorman (1905-1982) blended an international industrial aesthetic with national traditions to create a new architecture in a country reinventing itself. His most important work of this period included elementary schools and modernist house-studios designed for artists in Mexico City. Though O'Gorman would ultimately abandon modernism, these early buildings symbolize Mexico's transition from an agrarian past to an industrialized future. This talk considers a pair of studios built in 1929-1930 for Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo in the Mexico City suburb of San Angel. Recently restored, the Rivera-Kahlo complex serves as a case study for understanding O'Gorman's interpretation of international modernism and its meanings in the context of the artistic and political climate of Mexico City.

"Bizarre, strange, subversive. These words are often used to describe the art and writing of the Surrealist movement. Sprung from the tradition of Dada, the new art was born under the shadow of World War I with World War II on the horizon. During these interwar years, Surrealist artists and writers in France, particularly Paris, worked together, weaving a complex artistic and literary narrative, and affecting each other greatly. Writers and poets such as Andre Breton and Robert Desnos wrote about works of art by such artists as Alberto Giacometti and Marcel Duchamp. If these artists were not affected and influenced by the writings of Breton and Desnos, they were certainly aware of their Surrealist presence. Through analyses of literature and art, I will highlight the close relationships between these artists and literary figures and how these relationships affected the intensely creative works of each.

"Henry James and Guy de Maupassant wrote about their late nineteenth-century world with divergent perspectives on the place of morality in literature. James called Maupassant ""a lion in the path""; the French author was a conundrum to contend with because his admirable style often served to communicate content of questionable moral worth. In these early novels about driven parvenus, James and Maupassant scrutinize the ambition that fuels their protagonists. Each author writes death into his narrative in order to bring the weight of mortality to bear on our consideration of unbound aspirations. James\'s Christopher Newman demonstrates moral superiority by ultimately renouncing his ambition in the face of this grave reality; Maupassant\'s Georges Ouray, however, never sets limits on his own desires. In comparing these works, we observe the different attitudes of each author towards morality as they operate their examination of ambition.'"
"There are over 600,000 idle brownfield sites in the United States today. Brownfield neglect creates blight on the landscape and wastes useable land, thus encouraging urban sprawl. In addition, a less-recognized problem with brownfields is that they may discourage growth and development in the surrounding areas. This paper uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the EPA to explore whether brownfield redevelopment during the 1990s helped revitalize the areas adjacent to cleaned-up sites, specifically in the New England area. Success will be measured through examination of the effect of brownfield clean up on income, total population and the age, sex and racial composition of the population. Through this analysis, a conclusion may be drawn about the benefit of redeveloping environmentally contaminated sites on the surrounding areas throughout the United States. '"
"An increasing number of American firms are appealing to the International Trade Commission (ITC) for protection against foreign firms that are accused of ""dumping"" cheap goods in U.S. markets. The U.S. anti-dumping law serves as a protective measure that can impose tariffs and quotas on foreign firms whose goods injure U.S. producers. Unfortunately, the current anti-dumping regulations discriminate against foreign firms by punishing them for practices American firms themselves employ and which deprive consumers of the benefits of free trade. We focus our analysis on a specific 1998 ITC trade dispute in which two U.S. manufacturers of Elastic Rubber Tape (for use mostly in leg openings, waists and trimming in swimsuits and underwear) filed a dumping complaint against an Indian competitor. Fortunately, the ITC did not rule in favor of the U.S. petitioners, but it employed legal rather than economic reasoning in reaching its decision. '"
"""Although outlawed in some South Asian countries, dowries continue to be prominent in Sri Lankan society.

It was hypothesized that social radiation would occur most strongly in the dating condition, followed by the friends condition, and least strongly in the cousins condition. Findings revealed that social radiation did not occur; the quality of the male description did not impact participants' perceptions of the female companion. However, the type of relationship did have an effect on the perception of the female stimulus.

Attractiveness was operationalized with a photograph of a male manipulated to look more attractive for one condition than the other. Severity of behavior was operationalized by two scenarios: more severe, the professor placed his hand on the student's thigh; less severe, he placed his hand on her shoulder. Forty-eight college females were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. More attractive professors received less punishment, but physical attractiveness did not influence perceptions of personality.

"Past research indicates that a majority of American infants and young children sleep alone, separately from their parents or caregivers. The stress of this isolation frequently induces an attachment to special objects (e.g., blanket, teddy bear).

This study examines the hypothesis that early object attachment engenders a positive orientation towards material possessions in later life.

"The ethnic restaurant is an important space in contemporary American society because it is a revealing site for a greater analysis of the construction of authenticity. As evidenced by restaurant guides, food critics, and perhaps even diners like you, a restaurant lauded for being ""authentic"" provides an infinitely preferable dining experience. We need only to think of our dining halls\' interpretation of Chinese food to recognize the value we place on authenticity. To be able to recognize or appreciate authentic ethnic cuisine positions the consumer as knowledgeable, sophisticated and adventurous. My thesis attempts to deconstruct the traditional dichotomy of the authentic and , inauthentic. More meaningful than distinguishing between the two is questioning why we value it in the first place. I attempt to answer this question using my fieldwork in Chinese restaurants in Boston alongside the discourse of sociological and anthropological theories about food, ethnicity and the leisure and entertainment industry.

"""In order to understand identity and how it is constituted, it is necessary to analyze the multiple factors that shape an individual's self-identity. This paper is an analysis of multiculturalism as a discourse and how the institutional structures and modes of subjectivity that this discourse creates influence individual self-identity. Drawing on ethnographic research and interviews with Mexican-descent students at Wellesley College, this paper explores how campus-wide discourses of multiculturalism constitute students' experiences of self by defining the categories of difference through which self-identity becomes articulated. I argue that multiculturalism, as understood by most Wellesley students, establishes categories of difference founded on racial and ethnic variables that force students to identify themselves with one of these categories. My goal is to challenge people to consider the assumptions that underlie popular understandings of multiculturalism and to analyze the effects of this discourse in practice.

"""The battered women's shelter stands today as one of the most prevalent contemporary examples of architecture serving on a humanist level. Within the shelter, abused women find space to heal both physically and emotionally, as well as strength to escape the cycle of violence and establish a life independent of their abuser. However, what occurs when the gender of this architecture is inversed? Would a battered men's shelter look and act in the same way as a battered women's shelter? Would it even exist at all? This presentation examines the existence/nonexistence of battered men in the United States, and how these findings affect the need for an architectural solution. """
"""Under what conditions does the federal government intervene in river management decisions traditionally left to the states? Nowhere in the Constitution is the United States federal government explicitly given the right to manage the nation's river systems. Despite this, executive orders and laws enacted by congress have led to increasing federal agency involvement in river management. An understanding of the factors behind this federal intervention is essential, as our freshwater resources are rapidly declining. Moreover, an examination of federal intervention in river management may shed light on the many disputes surrounding the division of powers in our federalist system. This research examines federal intervention in rivers in terms of the economic and aesthetic conditions of particular rivers, the financial status of individual states, and the presidential political party in office. Results support the conclusion that federal intervention in river management is more likely under a democratic than a republican president. """
"What determines the extent to which an area is exposed to diesel emissions? Analyzing sources of pollution reveals much about the distribution of air pollution in the United States. Social and economic conditions may have a big impact on the location and extent of contamination; underdevelopment has burdened poor and minority communities and placed these groups at a higher risk for pollution in their neighborhoods and workplaces. My study examines the wide use of diesel engines in transportation and industry which threatens over one million American workers annually. While relatively few studies have been successful in determining effects of exposure to diesel, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health considers diesel a human carcinogen, as it contains up to 100 times more toxic particles than unleaded gasoline.

"The present study was designed to explore the environmental attitudes of students at Wellesley College. Four research questions were addressed: 1) Is there a significant difference between the environments in which ""highly green"" participants and ""nongreen"" participants grew up? 2) Is there a relationship between participants\' level of greenness and their sense of environmental identity? 3) Is there a significant difference between the level of greenness of Democrats and Republicans? 4) Do people with a higher level of environmental knowledge act greener? Data were collected using questions from written measures: the Environmental Response Inventory (ERI) (Kaiser & Biel, 2000) and the General Ecological Behavior scale (GEB) (McKechnie, 1971). Results indicated a significant association between level of greenness, environmental knowledge, environmental identity and the environment in which the participants were raised. '"
"Under what conditions are environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) most successful? I examine three factors that may influence NGO success: type of government, degree of localness of NGO actors, and degree of localness of NGO funding. I discuss theories regarding the significance of these three factors in relation to the success of environmental protection efforts. My range of cases includes NGOs targeted at Lake Baikal in Eastern Siberia and NGOs targeted at nuclear power plants in Russia and the Ukraine. I provide an overview of the environmental problems in these regions, and a history of some of the NGOs that were formed to respond to these problems. I then discuss the significance of correlations between the three examined factors and the level of success of each group. '"
"""When the Electoral College federally aggregates the popular vote, it distorts it through malapportionment and the winner-take-all system, leading to an electoral vote outcome that does not proportionally reflect the popular vote. Although the Electoral College usually selects the popular vote winner, due to the close popular vote in 2000, the Electoral College's distorting effects led it to select a president who placed second in the national vote count. In 1960, however, when the popular vote was even closer, the Electoral College did manage to select the popular vote winner. To explain this discrepancy in Electoral College outcomes, this presentation will examine how the constant two Senate votes favored Bush in 2000 and how the winner-take-all system favored Kennedy in 1960.

"This project examines from a sociological perspective, the symbols and rhetoric of persuasion and propaganda disseminated on the Internet by American groups that promote U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations. American isolationism in this form of expression tends to appear with a constellation of other concerns including the protection of civil and democratic rights, - to bear arms, to own private property, to have privacy - and issues of governance including protection of American national sovereignty and democracy, and protection against socialism, fascism, environmentalism and any form of world government. The effectiveness of propaganda depends upon its message and its symbolic content, its authors, means of dissemination and audience. This project will examine the first three components as well as the translation of ideas into actions, such as sponsorship of U.S. Congressional Bill # H.R. 1146 - The American Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2001.

"We live in a society that provides support and care for people living with disabilities while encouraging individuals to use prenatal testing and selective abortion to prevent the birth of future disabled people. The difference between the policies and practices towards the disabled community represent an often-ignored inconsistency. Some bioethicists believe this inconsistency is necessary to maintain social justice while others criticize it as erosion of social justice. The latter view is supported by the historical example of the human rights atrocities of the 1930s eugenics movement. Selective abortion and eugenics, however, have fundamental differences that enable mainstream bioethicists to argue that preventing the birth of disabled people is a moral obligation to society. The social justifications for selective abortion are based on the belief that disability is a burden on society. This thesis deconstructs this view by showing that the social justification of selective abortion is misinformed and a morally unacceptable attitude. '"
"The first juvenile courts, precursors of today\'s family courts, were designed to insulate children from the criminal justice system by creating a new legal standing that recognized a child\'s inherent right to special treatment. ln a Gallup poll conducted in 1993, seventy-three percent of respondents favored waiving juveniles into criminal court. Thirty-six states have statutes requiring juveniles to be automatically transferred to criminal court based on the crime committed, the age of the juvenile, or a prior record. How does one explain the evolution of early twentieth\xc2\xadcentury public policy, which treated children as fundamentally different from adults (and worthy of special treatment), to today\'s demand for ""tough-on juvenile crime"" legislation? Florida, New York and Texas provide an interesting context from which to examine this question, but they are only case studies of the most recent events in an evolving cultural and legal continuum.'"
"Although heavy metals are mutagenic in animals and bacteria, bacteria resistant to heavy metals are often found in heavy metal-contaminated soils. The former Henry Woods Paint Factory site in Wellesley, MA is currently being remediated by Haley & Aldrich, Inc. of Boston, MA because of high chromium (VI) and lead levels. The objective of this research was to isolate and characterize bacteria resistant to heavy metals from this environment and to study their mechanisms of resistance. Dilutions of soil samples were grown in rich medium containing one of the heavy metals. Bacteria were isolated and examined by electron and light microscopy to determine their structure and Gram reaction. Bacteria were plated on varying concentrations of heavy metals to determine how growth differed depending on heavy metal concentration. Most of the isolated bacteria grew in low heavy metal levels, while none survived in media with higher concentrations of heavy metals.

"Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes that have existed on earth under a wide range of environmental conditions for 3.5 billion years. The goal of our experiments is to determine how several strains of cyanobacteria respond to a variety of environmental stresses. Among the stresses applied are nitrogen starvation, low pH shock, and light deprivation. Techniques used in these investigations include cell-plating, fluorescence microscopy, 31 P and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, confocal microscopy, zymography, gel electrophoresis, column chromatography, autoradiography and visible spectroscopy. In our work this year, we have purified a protease involved in the recovery from nitrogen starvation. The rates of incorporation of two different nitrogen sources, NH4 + and N03-, into nitrogen-starved cells have been determined. We have studied the variation in cell pigments produced under these different stress conditions. Two methods for determining cell viability are also being compared. Although cyanobacteria grow optimally at pH 8, we now know that growth can also occur in media at pHs lower than 5.

"Numerous studies suggest that providing animals with enriching environmental stimuli, such as toys and social contact, improves learning. It is not surprising that enriching the environment of young animals would improve learning, but do the beneficial effects of enrichment extend to older animals? The current study examined whether enrichment improves spatial learning in middle-aged mice, and whether enrichment affects the activity of two chemicals in the brain: glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the synthetic enzyme for gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and levels of synaptophysin, a presynaptic marker. Lowered GABAergic activity is associated with improved memory, and enrichment is associated with synaptic sprouting, which may result from reduced GABAergic inhibition. Therefore, we hypothesized that enrichment would be associated with lowered GAD activity and increased synaptophysin levels. As hypothesized, low GAD activity was correlated significantly with several measures of good spatial learning. However, synaptophysin levels did not correlate with spatial learning.

Multiple regression analysis failed to reveal any significant relationships between the predictor variables and SAD. Reasons for the lack of significant findings are discussed. These include poor reliability of the survey instruments, particularly for SAD, and problems with the participant sample. '"
"Dolphins exhibit heterogeneity in vertebral osteology associated with different habitats and swimming style. This project asks if similar heterogeneity also exists among the ontogenetic stages of a single species. The Atlantic white-sided dolphin is capable of rapid and sustained swimming in oceanic habitats and displays one of the most derived patterns of vertebral osteology. Correlating increased size with age, individuals of Lagenorhynchus acutus of a wide size range were sampled for a variety of osteological parameters. The data were analyzed by comparison of standardized curves of vertebral dimensions and by comparison of serial complexity metrics. Vertebral columns of large (adult) dolphins are not simply bigger models of small (juvenile) forms, but differ in many anatomical details. Columns of large dolphins are more highly regionalized, show greater complexity and exhibit more osteological indicators of torso rigidity than do those of juveniles, allowing a faster and more sustained swimming style.

"""Improvisation in music involves elements of both structure and freedom, and the interplay between them. The melodic, rhythmic and harmonic aspects of a piece of music make up its structural elements, which inform and shape the improviser's solo statement. At the same time, the unique musical voice of the improviser comments on that structure in an original, spontaneous and playful way. Paradoxically, the limitations imposed by the structure provide a vehicle for freedom of expression, and the soloist's freedom of expression allows her to interact with the underlying structure of the piece. The improvising string ensemble Synergy illustrates this musical interplay in a concert of jazz and contemporary music. """

"""After the death of Vladimir ll'ich Lenin in 1924, the Communist Party created a cult of personality that glorified his life and expounded his virtues. One outcome of this cult was an increase in the amount of children's literature written about Lenin.

The Party used children's literature about Lenin to encourage children to adopt Soviet virtues, including atheism, collectivism, patriotism and love of work. While most children's authors followed this outline, authors such as Mikhail Zoshchenko secretly included conflicting subtexts in their work that contradicted the Party's stance. """
"To many Chinese, Eileen Chang was ""the most gifted Chinese writer to emerge in the forties."" Born in 1921 to a distinguished Chinese clan family, her childhood consisted of an absent mother, an opium-addicted father and a jealous stepmother. These and other life experiences are reflected in her writing. My presentation explores the superficial similarities and subtle distinctions of two works by Eileen Chang. First, ""The Golden Cangue"" (1943) describes the life and psychological journey of Cao Qiqiao, a young woman married to an invalid son in a prominent but declining family. Through Qiqiao\'s life, Chang shows the disintegration of the clan family structure at the end of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) and the oppression women experienced under the institutions of marriage and the family. Second, ""The Rouge of the North"" (1967) expands the plot of ""The Golden Cangue"" into a novel. However, while the earlier heroine displayed a lividly fanatical personality, twenty-four years later the heroine is more compassionate.'"
Two large minority cultures arose in Germany after the Second World War: the Jews and the Turks. Very few Jews survived the Holocaust and those who did usually chose not to stay in Germany. Those who remained faced difficulties because of the losses and sufferings experienced by them and their families. The second minority group to emerge was the Turks who arrived in Germany as guestworkers to improve the German economy after the war. Both groups remained minorities in a society trying to come to grips with its past. These minorities have found their voices and a rich literary tradition has grown out of their cultural and religious differences from Germans. Their works pose many questions such as: How do minorities express themselves in a culture often unwilling to listen? What does multiculturalism mean in Germany? '

"""The 1948 Civil War in Costa Rica marked a profound political transformation for the small Central American nation: the foundation of an enduring democratic regime. By analyzing the political activities of women at the local and national levels, the research focuses on Costa Rican women's struggles to legitimate their political voices and to advocate for social justice. The degree to which Costa Rican women can access their country's political system - as voters, as professionals, as activists and as volunteers - reveals how they may or may not benefit from their citizenship in a democratic state. Under consideration are the conditions under which Costa Rican women organize politically, the efforts of the Costa Rican state to facilitate women's political participation, and whether or not deliberate government attention to women's needs undermines or strengthens their presence in public life.

"The question of migration from el campo to the city characterizes the dialectic transformation of almost all Latin American cities in the twentieth century. Upon migrating to the city of La Paz, Aymarans, or the indigenous peoples from the high plateau of Bolivia, are relegated to specific Jiving and working spaces. In particular, Aymaran women are faced with the limited choice of being a seller or a servant. Within the private sphere of the house, the ruling class (descendants of Spanish colonizers) comes into direct, intimate contact with the colonized, indigenous woman. In this context, a complicated process of cultural hybridization occurs. The shifting boundaries between social categories of race, class and gender are reconstructed within the house. As the indigenous woman gains economic power, she furthermore actively reconstructs these multiple identities in relation to her collective, social position. She must find outlets of cultural expression as an urban, Aymaran woman with economic power: she auto-identifies herself as chola. This social category of ""chola"" as a hybrid identity will be explored further in terms of my shared living experience with an Aymaran domestic servant while abroad in La Paz, Bolivia last year.'"

Operating the telescope remotely, we monitored the emission spectra from ammonia and methanol present in molecular cloud S255, a region of star birth located about 2.5 kiloparsecs from Earth. From our measurements of the relative intensity of two complexes of ammonia emission lines, we determined the temperature and opacity of the cloud, and found it to be a relatively warm 25K, and fairly transparent. We also searched the cloud for methanol masers, and discovered a previously undetected companion to the only maser previously known in this region. In collaboration with Haystack Observatory astronomer Preethi Pratap, we will extend our search this spring for other masers in S255. '"
"""In the present study, Asian-American and Anglo-American college women were asked to evaluate an advertisement and answer questions about their personalities and cultural values. Subjects responded to one of two print advertisements for the same high technology product. One advertisement used collectivist cultural values (e.g., group interdependence and harmony) to sell the product, as presented in the pictures, slogan, and written copy of the ad, while the other used individualistic cultural values (e.g., independence and self-reliance). Subjects rated their impressions of the ad and responded to three personality measures. It was hypothesized that ethnicity would have some effect on subjects' impressions, with Asian-Americans preferring the collectivist ad to a greater extent than Anglo-Americans. However, it was hypothesized that subjects' personal orientation on individualism/collectivism, as well as their need for uniqueness, would predict their advertisement preferences to a greater extent.

"""Private provision of public goods has been the focus of much research in economics, because public goods are by nature non-excludable and therefore generate incentives for free riding. At an even more basic level, contributions to public goods raise fundamental questions about the nature of human beings - are they cooperative or selfish? We use laboratory experiments involving groups of subjects to address some of these questions. We show that contributions to public goods are based on the expectation that other members of society would contribute as well. Using a psychological trust scale, we find that there is a positive correlation between one's trust score and one's contribution. We also find that contributions are significantly higher when the feedback regarding group contributions is provided intermittently than when feedback is continuous. This project adds substantially to our understanding of the role of learning in public goods experiments and demonstrates the relation between one's level of trust of strangers and his/her predisposition to contribute to a public good.

"Previous work in the laboratory has demonstrated that a continuous dose of propranolol for one to three weeks induces fibrogenesis in the peripheral lung tissue of the rat. The current study was undertaken to determine the effects of short\xc2\xadterm b blockade on the peripheral lung, using a b-2 adrenergic blocker, ICI-118,551. Electron microscopy revealed damage to endothelial cells after two hours of continuous dose, or one hour after a bolus dose was injected. This damage was characteristic of the early stages of endothelial cell apoptosis. Type II cells in experimental tissue were found to contain more darkly stained lamellar bodies than controls, suggesting that b blockade may induce surfactant secretion. Some fibroblasts appeared active; thus b blockade may induce collagen deposition. These findings indicate that the long term effects of b blockade are the result of physiological changes to several cell types beginning rapidly after exposure to the drug. '"
"""This study explores personality and self-concept correlates of the degree of congruency between individuals' inner (private) and outer (public) selves. Individuals who score high on internal-external congruence should score high on measures of personal identity and private self-consciousness and low on measures of social identity and public self-consciousness. Individuals who score low on internal-external congruence should show the opposite pattern of scores on the self-concept measures. High internal-external congruence individuals should also score high on individuation and feminist attitudes but low on measures of self-presentation. High congruence should correspond to high scores on the Independence Personal Values Scale. Other personal values indicate how much people conform to societal values and how oriented they are toward expressing their personal needs. Low internal-external congruence should result in a pattern of high scores on the Social Skills and the Self-Control value scales. """
"Past studies of sexual harassment have addressed physical and psychological consequences, but limited research has focused on the association between sexual harassment and disordered eating in women. Literature reveals that sexual harassment has predictive power for eating and body image disturbance in women, but fails to include potential mediating factors to buffer such adverse outcomes. Studies have confirmed that using eating as a coping strategy to avoid or control negative emotions is linked to poorer overall psychological adjustment. Thus it seems likely that maladaptive coping strategies may mediate the psychological distress associated with sexual harassment and the onset of eating disorders. Moreover, the attributions made following the unwanted sexual advances have important implications for buffering adverse consequences in women. Studies have revealed that women who perceive discrimination experience harm to their psychological well being. They may cope with these negative consequences by increasing their gender group identification and adopting more liberal (feminist) attitudes and behaviors. Based on the arguments presented thus far, 1 am predicting and testing a path model that sexual harassment will predict psychological distress but will be mediated by type of coping strategy, attributions of blame, and gender identification. Eating will be seen as a specific and maladaptive coping strategy that also mediates this relationship. (Research supported by a grant from the Office of the Dean of the College) '"
"""Research indicates that adults have difficulty remembering events that occurred before age 3, but that the number of memories increases for events that occurred in later years (Waldfogel, 1948). While this general memory curve has been demonstrated for many targeted memories, it has not been demonstrated for dreams. We asked college students to describe their earliest memories of their dreams. In addition, their parents were asked to provide information about participants' dreaming. We hypothesized that the memory curve for dreams would be similar to the curve for general memory and that dreams high in emotion, recurrent dreams; and dreams discussed with parents would be more frequent in dream reports than would dreams low in emotion, single-occurrence dreams, and dreams not discussed with parents, respectively.

"""Throughout the 1980s, Japan's rising need for electric power and scarce natural resources forced the government and private industry to explore energy alternatives. Nuclear power generation, requiring minimal inputs yet providing the desired amount of electric power, met the needs of Japan's growing industry and population. Japan has become wedded to this production method, investing in its development and encouraging its use through the East Asian region. The nation has become so dependent on nuclear-generated power, that the construction and operation of nuclear power plants is extensive. However, the construction of these plants is not geographically widespread. Japan chose to build their plants in clusters, a phenomenon not found in other nuclear-dependent nations. The concentration of these plants is not haphazard but does hint at the urgency with which Japan developed it's nuclear program. Given time, this style of utility organization may influence nuclear plant construction worldwide. """
"Previous studies have shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in vertebrate cardiac muscle are activated during periods of decreased oxygen availability. The opening of this ion channel in the heart plays a protective role; however, the precise mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. I studied cardiac channel activation in a hypoxia-tolerant species, the goldfish (Carassius auratus), focusing on the potential role of nitric oxide (NO) in this process. Moderate, substrate-free hypoxia resulted in a shortening of ventricular action potential duration, a response that was blocked by the KATP channel antagonist BDM. In single-channel studies, increased KATP channel activity during hypoxia was abolished by BDM and the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ, but mimicked by a cGMP analog. These results suggest that KATP channels in goldfish heart are activated by hypoxia-induced NO release and the subsequent rise in cGMP levels. (Supported by the Office of the Dean of the College) '"

"""This paper attempts to explain the reasons for the substantial differences among Asian American ethnic subgroups in terms of academic achievement. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, I show that there are statistically significant differences not only among racial groups, but also among Asian subgroups on eighth grade standardized exams. Furthermore, I show that these differences in test scores are a result of their parents' socioeconomic status and English language skills, parental involvement in their academic life, and individual student academic goals. Finally, I will propose necessary avenues for future research in this area and offer policy recommendations as ways to bridge the achievement gap among Asian American subgroups. """

"Global warming may impact plant communities in the Arctic. One model suggests that a warming climate will stimulate microbial activity and increase nutrient availability in tundra ecosystems. We investigated how 11 years of experimental nutrient enrichment (N plus P fertilization) of wet sedge plots at the Toolik Lake LTER site on the North Slope of Alaska is influencing species composition and seasonal biomass accumulation. We estimated aboveground biomass of dominant species using regression analyses that predict species biomass from frequencies of point frame hits across the growing season. The N plus P fertilization increased aboveground biomass by a factor of 3.6 and dramatically altered species composition. N plus P additions also increased the amount of standing litter, lowered soil temperature, and reduced thaw depth. Long-term fertilization, therefore, impacts wet sedge tundra communities both directly and indirectly. '"
"VV Cephei is an eclipsing binary star system with a large, cool star orbited by a smaller, hotter star that has a 20-year orbital period. We have been using Hubble Space Telescope data to observe changes in the spectrum as the hot star moves out of eclipse and its light passes through successively higher layers of the cool star atmosphere. I measured the wavelengths of emission lines during totality and egress so that they can be subtracted from the composite spectrum for further atmospheric analysis. Other lines show an interesting doubling while they fade as the star comes out of eclipse. Measurements of this line doubling will allow us to look for velocity structure in the cool star atmosphere.

Are holding on and letting go, in fact, one and the same process? The author of this compilation strives to explore rather than answer these vital and intricate questions. '"
"""Classical Japanese differs from modern Japanese in many ways in terms of grammar and vocabulary. In addition, the age that the work was written in creates differences within classical Japanese itself. For my research I have attempted to translate a variety of selected short pieces from famous texts such as the Manyoshu, Kokinshu, and Sei Shonagon's The Pillowbook. The appreciation of nature in regard to human emotion and the observation of everyday life in relation to self are some of the themes that these selected texts focus on. Although certain translations have already been published, it is interesting to note the differences between two published translations of the same text. Various challenges, such as the preservation of style and communication of emotion, will also be presented. """

"""During the years surrounding Algeria's independence from France in 1962, many Algerians and their families immigrated to France in search of a better and more prosperous life. The children of these families were faced with the challenge of understanding and integrating themselves into the new culture, one which often came into conflict with the strong moral and religious beliefs of their parents. Struggling to define their identity, these children were forced to create their own space, and at the crossroads of the two cultures a new genre of francophone literature emerged, known as Beur literature.

"Franco-American relations have become tenuous of late, largely as a result of recent American foreign policy decisions. The Kyoto Protocol, the events of September 11, 2001, followed by American intervention in Afghanistan, and the current Iraqi conflict have all led to heightened tensions between the two allies. Whereas the American abrogation of the Kyoto Protocol sparked dissent among the French, the events of 9/11 inspired unexpected French support for the United States. This support, however, was largely illusory since the French government supported military action in Afghanistan in spite of public opposition. More recently, with regard to the Iraqi conflict, France has become one of the most vocal critics of the United States. Through an examination of American policies and corresponding French reactions, I intend to illustrate that differences in the foreign policies of these two nations can be attributed to the differences in their respective values.'"
"""Recent world events have led to what many are calling the worst crisis in NATO's history. While many fear that the past couple of months' occurrences are suddenly throwing NATO into a fateful turmoil, others anticipated such change in the alliance since the end of the cold war. While realists, institutionalists, and democratic peace theorists presented very different predictions for NATO after the collapse of the Soviet Union, all of them anticipate the end of the alliance as it has been known for the past fifty years. As NATO takes on new roles and struggles with modern security challenges, its actions can be compared to different theoretical predictions to test the theories, and also to clarify the likely evolution of NATO in upcoming years. Depending on whether NATO is following realist, institutionalists, or democratic peace theoretical trends, it can be determined whether the alliance is truly in the terminal crisis that many now fear."""

An increasingly powerful transnational upper class, with strong links to the U.S., supported civilian\xc2\xadmilitary regimes across the region, believing this was the most effective way to maintain an international order partial to American interests. The diminished influence of political parties combined with the lingering effects of military rule, inequality, and international interest groups have resulted in a loss of state control - casting doubt on the extent of successful democratic consolidation. International forces that deter democracy deny the underprivileged the opportunity to control their destiny, thus, the strength of democracy in Latin America is vital given that political participation is central to human development."""

"George Berkeley\'s defense of idealism redefines our conception of knowledge. His trenchant analysis dismisses the existence of material substances while maintaining that only minds and their ideas exist. Material objects become collections of ideas, immediately perceived by the senses. Berkeley\'s predecessors maintained that material objects possess an autonomous existence revealed through their causal relations. Berkeley\'s main argument, ""esse is percipi,"" states that the existence of any sensible thing depends on its being perceived. Although one may imagine objects existing without being perceived, this testifies only to the framing of ideas while simultaneously refraining from framing the idea of someone who perceives them. Despite the strength of his arguments, Berkeley faces several problems, among them the task of demonstrating that other minds exist and can be known. Moreover, his philosophy of science, which carries with it his idealism, leads to some surprising consequences in mathematics and physics.

"School violence emerged on the national political agenda in the 1960s, although it was not until the early 1990s that in light of highly publicized school shootings, it became a widespread public concern. Media reports continue to characterize school violence as a catastrophic, endemic social problem growing into an untamable behemoth. But these reports seem to fly in the face of statistical trends that suggest the rates of school violence have been relatively stable since they began to be collected on a national level in the mid-l 970s. Even more interesting is the fact that these same statistics suggest that school violence is not, and never was, a purely urban phenomenon, even though popular media have characterized it in this way.

"South Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI), British West Indies (BWI) is one of the few islands in the Caribbean and North Atlantic regions that does not currently have any viable tourism industry.

Such development will most certainly affect the surrounding ecosystems and could be extremely detrimental to the pristine coral reef of the area. Many coral reef areas within the TCI have already been declared marine protected areas (MPAs), but governments are constantly revising these decisions. It is important to establish an accurate and comprehensive economic value of the coral reef so that it can be used in cost-benefit analysis, which is used by governments when determining whether an area should become or remain an MPA.

"This study will examine relationships between self-esteem and autobiographical memories of adolescence. Participants will be asked to describe memories of moments in adolescence in which they felt ""especially good"" or ""especially bad"" about themselves and to rate the importance and affective quality of these memories. Because research has shown that self-esteem declines around the ages of 11-13 and then rises gradually in later adolescence and throughout adulthood, it is hypothesized that memories of negative events will cluster in early adolescence while positive memories will cluster in late adolescence. In addition, the content of the memories of individuals with high and low self-esteem are expected to differ; for instance, it is predicted that participants with higher self-esteem will describe more ""redemption sequences"" in which affectively negative events are portrayed in a positive light.

"""By kindergarten, children, especially boys, already know which behaviors are appropriate and inappropriate for their gender. Much research has focused on children's acquisition of gender stereotypes, and on the early gender differentiation of the play behaviors of pre-schoolers. Less research, however, has attempted to link children's understanding of gender to their behaviors in schools. This study sought to establish those links among preschool boys, using both a validated instrument and naturalistic observations. It was expected that boys with stronger gender schemas would exhibit more aggressive behaviors in play, as aggression is considered stereotypical behavior for boys. However, results of this study indicated that it was the boys who exhibited both more prosocial and more aggressive behaviors who were most likely to demonstrate strong gender schemas. Therefore, boys who were better at interpreting social cues, such as gender stereotypes, were more likely to engage in social behavior with other children. """
"""The Western imagination has been captivated by monolithic images of 'the Japanese': submissive woman, samurai warrior, disciplined company worker. The assumption persists that Japan suffers from neither the problems resulting from ethnic tensions nor marked social class gaps. However, the difficulty of characterizing Japanese society as resistant to the shocks posed by diversity becomes apparent when we consider Japan's 'invisible' minority, the Okinawans. During the summer of 2002, I conducted an onsite study of the Okinawan migrant community in Osaka, central Japan's largest commercial center and a culturally vibrant city. I will share my observations of how the Okinawan spirit endures in light of discrimination and pressure to become more 'Japanese.' Moreover, I will explore the challenges that Okinawans face in forging an identity that is both Japanese and distinctly Okinawan. The Okinawan experience raises questions not only about Japan's purported homogeneity, but also about its self-image, past, present, and future.

"This exploratory study examines tourist videos and Hollywood feature films for their portrayal of the Hawaiian Islands. These two different sources of representations provide their own narrative and construction, drawing on existing language of images and stereotypes as part of the construction of an imagined world, ""The Tropical Paradise."" The significance of the natural landscape is expressed and felt in the visual imagery: vibrant forests, picturesque beaches, spewing active volcanoes, strong waves and surfs, noble mountain ranges, and empty blue skies. This research finds and extracts patterns in the images presented, gaining a better understanding of how these patterned codings create a particular image of Hawai\'i. Since emphasis is placed on making this destination the right kind of ""Hawaiian Paradise,"" visual images become simplifications, misrepresentations, and generalizations of Hawai\'i. The overlap and disjuncture between the constructed, imagined world and the reality can create a mystifying experience for locals and tourists. '"
"In the spring of 1959, Basque nationalists founded ET A, a separatist group seeking independence from Spain. Forty-four years later, the Basque region is still a part of Spain and ETA has killed more than 800 people for its cause. The terrorist group was formed during the Franco dictatorship, when Basque language and culture were actively repressed. Since 1978, Spain has been a democratic state, with a new constitution that gives the Basque region considerable political autonomy. In spite of the new political and cultural framework, ETA continues killing for its cause. Because radical nationalists continue to view Madrid as oppressor, the strategies of the various central governments (both liberal and conservative) have not been able to solve the problem of terrorism in Spain. A hypothetical plan devised and supported by the Basque government provides a chance for ending the violence and terrorism in Spain. '"
"""In the midst of the twentieth century's nationalist movements and global decolonization, the British presided over two significant territorial partitions, in India and in Palestine. These contemporaneous partitions, each rooted in communal conflict, resulted in legacies of terrorism, massive population transfers and territorial disputes. This study will explore the impact of British colonial interests on communal conflict in India and Palestine from a comparative perspective and focus on how these communal conflicts were transformed into distinct national aspirations. Research will trace how this common British administration led to similar present-day situations in these regions. """
"""The Bush Administration came to office touting national missile defense (NMD) as a response to nuclear missile threats from rogue states. Yet in its confrontation with Iraq, the Administration has not stressed NMD, or even theatre missile defense (TMD). In accordance with its new National Security Strategy (NSS) the Bush Administration has instead advanced the idea of preventive war. What explains this choice? If the United States' missile defense is to be successful, it must be technologically possible, cost effective, and acceptable by other international actors. According to missile defense aims, the threat posed by Iraq presented a rogue state that would seem to be an optimal target for the use of missile defense. U.S. strategy is evaluated as it relates to Iraq in explanation of preventive war instead of national missile defense deployment. """
"Following the Zapatista Uprising of 1994 in Chiapas, Mexico, the issue of indigenous rights rose to the forefront of Mexican politics. The complex debate surrounding this issue reflects the difficulty of incorporating minority groups into modern liberal democracies. The basic principles of liberal democracy emphasize individuality and a sovereign, limited territory. In contrast, indigenous groups reject the supremacy of the individual by seeking group-specific rights. They also challenge the myth that autonomous regions will lead to national fragmentation.

"Electrorheological fluids are defined as 0.1-100 mm particles suspended in an insulating liquid, which experiences a dramatic and reversible rheological change when an electric field is applied. Particles form long chains parallel to the electric field, causing the viscosity of the suspensions to increase by as much as several orders of magnitude. My research uses Matlab computer simulations to study electrorheological fluids under a steady shear-flow. The simulations model the behavior of the suspended particles as a result of varied particle spinning rates, particle size, relaxation times, and shearflow strength. Results indicate that average stress varies substantially as a function of particle spinning. In addition, for high shear and for low tilt angles, the simulations suggested that the onset of an electric field will cause the viscosity of the suspension to decrease.

"In the early 1990s, physicists developed a method to cool and trap atoms in the gas phase using laser light and magnetic fields. The technique of ""laser cooling and trapping"" results in the coldest matter ever produced - the trapped and cooled atoms have a temperature on the order of a few ten-thousandths of a degree above absolute zero (~0.0002 Kelvin). Students and faculty at Wellesley have been working over the past few years to design and construct a cooling and trapping apparatus in the Laser Lab. Building on previous work centering around the construction of highly stabilized diode lasers and a source of atomic rubidium, we completed the development of this apparatus and we successfully cooled and trapped rubidium atoms in a ""magneto\xc2\xadoptical trap"" (on the last day of our ten\xc2\xadweek research project!).

"Mafic volcanic rocks associated with the Roxbury Conglomerate in the Boston Basin, eastern Massachusetts, have Jong been inferred to reflect Neoproterozoic arc magmatism. However, preliminary U-Pb geochronology of these ""Brighton"" lava flows in several localities throughout the region has yielded zircons ranging from Neoproterozoic to Devonian in age due to inheritance. New work on flows and associated volcanic ash cropping out south of Boston at Worlds End Reservation presents the opportunity to better constrain the age of the volcanism. Sea cliff exposures at Worlds End show a series of four conglomerates and two interbedded ""Brighton"" flows, all unconformably overlying the Dedham Granite. A yellowish gray volcanic ash fills vesicles within and overlies one of the flows and is the best target for U-Pb geochronology. Geochemistry and detailed petrography on a variety of samples from the locale provide additional insight into the stratigraphy and geologic history of Worlds End. '"
"LabView is a programming language designed specifically for laboratory instrumentation. Unlike traditional computer languages that use text commands, LabView uses icons and wires to construct a computer program. I translated a control program for a spectrometer from Microsoft Professional Basic language into image\xc2\xadbased Lab View. Spectrometers separate light into its wavelength components (colors) and measure the intensity of each by counting how many photons land on a detector in a fixed amount of time. The program allows users to step through a range of wavelengths, taking an intensity reading at each step. This creates a graph of intensity as a function of wavelength- a spectrum. Spectral scans are used to identify an unknown light source or examine the quantum mechanical properties of atoms. Since the spectrometer is not portable, I will demonstrate how my program works using a Geiger counter, which counts radioactive decay particles over time.'"

"The substitution of an amide bond with a thioamide alters the conformation of the thionated peptide compared to the oxo version. We have employed this feature to synthesize peptides for use as possible enzyme inhibitors and structures in which to study the conformational effects of strengthened hydrogen bonding. The altered electronic structure induced by the presence of a thioamide may be useful in addressing problems such as the in vivo cleavage of an inhibitor for the enzyme thimet oligopeptidase. The synthesis of a 12-residue thiopeptide allows for the study of the conformational effects of altered hydrogen bonding in the b-hairpin structure. A 100% folded control and a 100% unfolded control will be used to quantify the extent of hairpin formation using CD and NMR spectroscopy.

"""Research demonstrates that offering a reward for a creative task diminishes creativity. One explanation is that the reward acts as a distraction. According to this hypothesis, offering a reward and placing distracting objects in the room during the task should both yield similar results: decreased creativity, poor memory of the task, and high recall of the environment. Thirty children aged 3-5 years were assigned to one of three groups: control, reward, or distraction. Children participated in two sessions, four days apart. In the first session, all completed the same creativity task - making a collage using geometric shapes. The control group completed the task without a reward or distractions. The reward group was promised a reward upon completion of the study. The distraction group performed the task with three distracting objects in the room. The second session assessed memory of both environment and creativity task. The groups' performance will be discussed. """
"Prior research demonstrates that children\'s popularity in the classroom is linked to their social skills (e.g., Connolly & Doyle, 1981; Howes, 1988) and that both are related to having friends and the quality of those friendships (e.g., Brendgen, Little, & Krappmann, 2000; Sebanc, 2000). This study examined characteristics of preschoolers\' friendships and how children\'s social skills and classroom popularity contribute to their relationships with classmates. Children were shown pictures of their classmates and asked how often they played with them and whom they ""liked to play with the most."" Additionally, they rated the quality of their friendships and their own social skills through structured interviews. Teachers also evaluated children\'s social skills and the quality of their friendships by completing questionnaires. To check for changes in children\'s friendships and popularity, children again responded to questions about their peers one month later. '"
"""Each fall, students arrive at colleges and universities across the world to begin their first year of college. Within each new diverse cohort of first-year students, there is immense variation in students' perceptions of their academic abilities. Not only do these self-perceptions serve to establish an emotional tone for students' college experiences, they have also been shown to have a significant impact on the students' actual performance levels. But why do college students vary so greatly on this dimension? The wide spectrum of their high school experiences may help to explain their differences in academic self\xc2\xadconcept. This study is an exploratory investigation of the role played by a number of possible influential aspects of the high school experience in determining the mathematical, verbal, and general school self-concepts of Wellesley College first-years.

"""Do religious arguments belong in the public deliberation advocated by political theories of democracy and multiculturalism? If secular rationality is not a neutral framework then its ability to ensure inclusion and equality in a multifaith society is questionable. Yet, political theorists' discussions of multiculturalism have not often dwelt on incorporating religious communities in political deliberation. Actual as well as perceived differences between religious groups and other marginalized members of society such as ethnic and racial communities make it difficult to fit religious groups into theories of discussion that assume a universal conception of rationality. Attempts to create unity by silencing alternative rationalities can be counterproductive. Yet, can discussion based on multiple conceptions of rationality be sustained?

"""Jewish citizens play an important role in current American politics, through direct and indirect involvement in government. However, how did the Jewish communities of ancient times balance their responsibilities to their religious and civic communities, if they did at all? Through an examination of the writings of Philo and Josephus, along with other Jewish texts of the Greco-Roman era, I describe the ideal role for Jews in civic, secular government. I also comment on the influence that the Greek philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, had on Philo's view of the Jew's role in politics, and where Philo diverges from classical Greek thought. Through an analysis of Hellenistic Jewish literature of this time period, we can gain a greater understanding of Greco-Roman contributions to Jewish political thought. """
"Words and music combine in worship to operate on a different level than in any other context, raising the singer to a worshipful state by the combination of language and tone. But when the text of an old favorite hymn has been altered, the singer is jolted out of this liminal state into discordance, the very opposite of what is necessary for a contemplative, joyous worship experience. In 1995, the United Church of Christ published The New Century Hymnal, created by a committee charged with bringing the worship of member churches into the twenty-first century. New hymns were added and old ones altered to make their language inclusive. Critics of the hymnal maintain that the alterations create basic changes in the orthodox Christian theology of the denomination. Supporters welcome the hymnal\'s ""open and affirming"" outlook. My examination of changes in selected hymn texts from the eighteenth century to the present attempts to determine if the new hymnal achieves the goals set for it by the national UCC leadership without creating a completely new theology.

In order to promote a modern understanding of that historical culture, audience members will be invited to participate in exercises that will introduce them to the Restoration world.

"The International Labor Organization (ILO) has, since its creation, provided an international dimension to the domestic push for improved working conditions. In pursuit of this goal, the ILO has generated more than 184 conventions on various aspects of work. Yet, despite efforts to match the generation of conventions to the changing exigencies of capitalist production, the idea of what constitutes a \'worker\' has remained largely static. By conducting a critical examination of the ILO\'s 184 conventions, my research reveals that only modest changes have occurred in the way in which ""worker"" is conceived within the ILO. This paper, by analyzing ILO conventions across four periods, traces not only the relatively static nature of this definition, but also the social forces that have underpinned its (lack of) development. The paper concludes with an exploration of the implications of such a lack of development at the outset of the twenty-first century. (Research supported by the Office of the Dean of the College) '"

"""I call upon the most determined and sought-after among you to provide leadership to ensure that the United States lives up to its promise."" - Wendy Kopp, founder and president of Teach for America An entire generation of teachers nation\xc2\xadwide will retire over the next few years, leaving our schools severely short of teachers. Alternative certification programs such as Teach for America have emerged in response to the shortage. Teachers from these programs are not certified by the same means as traditional teachers, and many feel that the teachers produced by these programs are underqualified and may do more damage in the classroom than good. The debate over teacher quality and alternative certification programs is raging, with programs such as Teach for America at the heart of the dispute. I will try to determine some of the possible effects of TFA within the context of the larger debate over teacher quality. What types of students apply to TFA? What is their motivation? If the majority of people who do TFA move on after two years, how much good is the program actually doing for our schools? I will seek to answer these questions and offer some policy recommendations about the long-term effects of alternative certification programs, such as Teach for America, on our nation\'s schools. '"
"What are the driving forces behind the importation of hazardous waste into developing countries? Under what conditions is a country more prone to allowing toxic waste into its borders? In spite of regulatory measures such as the Basel Convention, the issue of hazardous waste disposal has become increasingly complex and ambiguous. In spite of its virtual disappearance from national headlines, the prevalence of the hazardous waste trade continues to afflict both developing and developed countries. Through a case study analysis of the West African region, this study proposes economic, political, and environmental determinants in accounting for the amount of hazardous waste imported into developing regions.

"""Citizens of the developed world have, as a function of their industrialized economies, clamored for the protection of their natural environment: for businesses to either not pollute or to clean up those messes that they create. On the surface, this pollution of the developed world appears to have stopped. But have these polluting industries simply relocated to the developing world and degraded it as they originally did their home countries? This study examines the factors that contribute to environmental degradation in the developing world, specifically South America, with a focus on the impact of national and multinational chemical industries on the natural environment. Other factors examined include the wealth of developing nations, the national importance of agriculture and industry, the total available land mass and the percent of that land devoted to agricultural production, government corruption levels, and the multinationals' countries of origin.

"""The developed world, with only 25% of the world's population, claims most of the world's consumption. This includes consumption of 85 % of all forest products and 75 % of all energy produced in a year while producing 75 % of all pollutants and waste. This consumption has grave consequences for the environment and must be reduced in the interest of environmental sustainability. But to design solutions we must first understand consumption and what affects it. I examined the differing levels of environmentally negative consumption in Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Then, I studied how a country's population density, wealth, level of government consumption, and general environmental performance affect its level of consumption. """
"""What factors determine the extent to which Native American tribal policies on fishing are environmentally friendly? What measures, if any, are being taken by tribes in an effort to achieve the sustainability of fisheries on reservation land? What has led to the creation of these policies? As semiautonomous nations, tribes have a potentially different set of priorities from nontribal entities regarding fish and fishing practices, and are subject to different government regulations. In an examination of the fishing policies of eight federally recognized tribes, it was determined that religious rituals and cultural traditions, revenue generated from fishing, and treaty history all play a role in the level of environmental friendliness of a tribe's policies, while tribal wealth does not. These findings suggest that tribes will work to protect the things they hold to be sacred, including fishing, and that cultural and religious traditions matter more than economic factors when it comes to issues of conservation.

"Since the failure of the Clinton health initiative in 1993, the fate of American health policy is primarily in the hands of the states. While the states confront the daunting challenge of covering their populations with the similar legislative and bureaucratic options, health policy outputs vary greatly among the states. As a result, our nation must face questions of equity in a context of New Federalism. My thesis research, presented here, attempts to answer the following questions: What factors lead states to increase accessible health coverage? What factors prevent other states from legislating to increase health access? Quantitative analysis and descriptive case studies considering political, demographic, and economic characteristics in relation to health coverage, will be presented.

"""After Norplant was approved in December 1990, several states began to offer cash bonuses to women receiving public assistance who agreed to use long-acting birth control. Among other objections, such initiatives were often accused of being coercive. A coercive proposal is usually defined as a threat that diminishes an agent's freedom of choice to the point that her subsequent action is said to be forced or involuntary. Offers like birth control incentive programs, however, provide an agent with options she previously did not have. Is it possible for a proposal that expands an agent's options to be coercive nonetheless? In my talk, I would like to use the Norplant example to highlight some of the philosophical problems involved with defining coercion and distinguishing between threats and offers.

"Roe v. Wade established the right to an abortion and has withstood great controversy over the past thirty years. Even with possible modifications to the ruling as a result of conservative judicial appointments to the Supreme Court, the right to an abortion will likely remain intact. The question then becomes how long America will continue to be one of the only nations polarized over the issue of abortion. Grassroots efforts to ameliorate the social divide over abortion in America will be examined in their historical and present\xc2\xadday contexts. The power of new interpreters of abortion and American views of abortion within the American context will be scrutinized to discern the possibilities for eventual reconciliation of the issue. Great observers of American culture such as Edmund Burke and Alexis de Tocqueville will be utilized in order to judge whether or not America can ever move from the revolutionary effects of Roe v.

"The nineteenth century was the golden age of the German Art Song (Lied). Composers such as Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Felix Mendelssohn, and Richard Strauss, transformed it from a minor musical genre, considered far inferior to opera, into a major artistic and creative endeavor in its own right. The works being presented in this concert draw primarily from the German romantic and postromantic song repertoire, although we will include several of Mozart\'s songs. We will then present some of Schubert\'s most famous works, ranging from the early compositions of ""Heidenroslein"" and ""Gretchen am Spinnrade,"" to the longer ""Der Hirt auf dem Felsen,"" which was composed the year he died and published posthumously. Other composers whose works we will perform include two of the most famous ""couples"" of the nineteenth-century musical world: Robert Schumann and his wife Clara (Wieck) Schumann, and siblings Felix and Fanny (Hensel) Mendelssohn. In addition, postromantic works such as Strauss\'s ""Zueignung"" and ""Morgen"" will show the evolution of the genre at the end of the century. The music will be accompanied by a discussion of some of the poetry to which this music is set, as well as the development and major influences of each of the composers whose songs we presented. '"

"""E.M. Forster's interest in the constraints of social class drew him to represent the realm of nature as a space of liberation. Forster's versions of nature in his novels and short stories contain suggestions of the mythical, classical, and exotic, with settings in Italy, Greece, and England. Differences between Forster's early and later fiction and, again, between the work he published during his lifetime and work published posthumously show the freedom he associated with nature, evolving in his imagination from a socially unconventional marriage in A Room with a View, to the freedom of the hero in Maurice to love another man of a lower social class. The different versions of nature presented in the course of Forster's career tellingly reflect the author's evolution in response to the changing social realities of the era and gradual acceptance of his own inner nature."""
"Critics have long disagreed on whether Henry James\'s late novels were his best or if they were the work of a master who had gone too far. F. R. Leavis even declared The Ambassadors to be ""not only not one of his great books, but to be a bad one."" But James believed it to be one of his best works. In his critical writing, James stated that ""a novel is in its broadest definition a personal, a direct impression of life."" James seems to have had this definition in mind while writing The Ambassadors. We see the events of the novel through the eyes of the hero, Lewis Lambert Strether and it is through his impressions that James shows the growth of consciousness.

"Poetry is one of the most expressive forms of literature. Through poetic verse, the poet is able to reveal his or her most intimate feelings. Although poetry has always acted as a forum for both political and social activism, this role gained new importance in the volatile era of the twentieth century.

He strove to awaken the social consciousness of others by infusing his poetry with examples of injustice both in his native country of Chile and around the world, transcending both cultural and social boundaries. As one critic wrote, he was ""un rebelde positivo"", a positive rebel. He was, in all respects, a poet of the people.

Her work represents a resistance to and a struggle against these forces that plagued her consciousness. Ultimately, Plath\'s internal battles led to her death in 1963, but her work remains a testament to the triumph of art. '"

"""Using patents as an indicator of invention, we explain the spatial distribution of technological creativity in the United States between 1963 and 1999. Borrowing a technique from empirical international trade analysis, we use constant market share analysis to decompose each state's patenting into components attributable to the national trend, growth of creative industries, growth of consuming sectors, and sectoral shifts. Each component is explained using socioeconomic variables (e.g. population, education, income, and research spending). Tests confirm that population growth creates more patenting activity and that more populous, higher\xc2\xadincome states are better able to follow the national trend. Surprisingly, low-income states are more agile in abandoning stagnating sectors, and federal research grants limit a state's ability to keep up with the national trend, perhaps fostering lock-in to initial sectors.

"""Though once thought to have been wiped out, the white plague, tuberculosis, has reemerged as a modern medical concern. Today's strains of the disease are more highly virulent as well as resistant to the drugs that were once sufficient to defeat it. As it has been 40 years since the last major breakthrough in drug development for TB, it is now imperative to synthesize new, stronger medicines to attack the recent mutations of the life threatening bacterium. lsoxyl, a thiourea, and para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) are two drugs that have proven effective at fighting TB in the past, but have neither the strength nor the stability to fight the modern drug resistant TB strains. PAS, for example, will break down into a toxic compound when exposed to heat, thus making it poorly suited to cure patients in warm tropical climates where TB is currently most rampant. These proven drugs, however, can be used as potential leads for new ones. We have used the methods of synthetic organic chemistry to functionalize phenyl PAS, a stabler strains of tuberculosis.

"The role of the beta-adrenergic system and cardiac myocyte apoptosis has become a topic of interest. Previous studies in vitro have found that exposure of cardiac myocytes to norepinephrine, a wide-range adrenergic agonist, increases the number of apoptotic cells. b-adrenergic agonists have been found to mimic the effects of norepinephrine, while the wide-range b-adrenergic antagonist propranolol countered its effects. The current project focused on the in vivo effects of continuous doses of isoproterenol, a wide-range beta agonist, and propranolol. The drugs were administered subcutaneously to rats, using osmotic pumps, for 24 or 48 hours and the cardiac tissue was studied through light and electron microscopy. While the myocytes treated with propranolol appeared to be healthy, evidence of apoptosis in other cardiac cells was present.

"""The movement to reform restrictive abortion Jaws began locally, as activists attempted to pass reform and repeal legislation in a handful of states, relying largely on arguments regarding the public health crisis that had arisen as the result of illegal abortions. However, as feminist groups gained support and momentum, the concept of abortion as a woman's right emerged. Because many legislatures were resistant to change, advocates abandoned the strategy of seeking policy change through the legislatures and catapulted the issue into the courts, arguing that by denying access to abortion, states were abridging women's constitutional rights. The momentous ruling of Roe u. Wade in 1973 established a strict scrutiny standard for statutes limiting abortion access. However, the constitutional right to abortion was subsequently eroded most notably by the 1992 Planned Parenthood u. Casey decision which established that states could pass restrictive laws as long as they did not pose an 'undue burden' to a woman's access to abortion."""

This study looks specifically at fourteen Senate races from the year 2002 to assess three questions: 1) Does the media cover female candidates less frequently, and is the coverage that does exist less favorable? 2) Is the press more likely to allow male candidates to determine which issues will be covered? and 3) Does the media attribute less favorable personality traits to female candidates? Data were collected from a content analysis of the most widely circulated newspaper in each of the states studied and the candidates\' campaign Web sites. '"
"Our title indicates the initial impetus for our inquiry. We are 11 students who worked together last semester in ARTS 208, Intermediate Photography. This semester, we are exploring for the first time the 4x5 view camera, a slow moving piece of equipment and a time consuming process. Our exhibit stems from a desire to use these numbers as the kernel of our projects. We are allowing ourselves the freedom to use them in multiple ways and with varying questions and definitions. 4x5 inches per print? 4x5 size film? 11 images from said film?

"""A knock, a crash, talking, trumpet sounding, frog's croaking, steam whistle, glass breaking ... To most people, these sounds in immediate juxtaposition will seem chaotic, perhaps even disturbing. But when I heard the first sequence of John Cage's Williams Mix, these seemingly unconnected sounds enabled me to see how to connect two divergent parts of my life - my love of music and my fascination with math and science. After hearing my first piece by Cage, I immediately dove into the genre of electronic and experimental music, listening to whatever I could get my hands on, reading lectures by artists and musicians, and creating my own pieces in this medium. I have continued composing throughout the year, and I would like to present my work to the Wellesley Community.

"The great American writer Raymond Carver published short stories and poetry from 1976 to 1988. His powerful ""minimalist"" technique reveals his admiration of Anton Chekhov and Ernest Hemingway. Reflecting on the disappointments of American life, Carver\'s style is strikingly clear and honest, his voice ranging from deadpan humor to eerie bleakness. In this independent study, I explored several aspects of Carver\'s work, including the silences that often occur as muted climaxes or awakenings at the end of his stories, when his character(s) reach a silent, sometimes open-ended conclusion to the difficulties that lie behind and ahead of them.

"""In late eighteenth-century England, women were depended upon to accept their roles as domestic figureheads by fulfilling their obligations as wives and mothers. The female sphere was decidedly fixed in substance and scope, and pressing beyond its borders would not only jeopardize definitions of sexual difference but also threaten the social structure on which matters of ideology, politics, wealth, and property rested. By writing professionally, woman writers risked an internal confusion over their place in a disapproving world and a struggle with self-acceptance amidst a conservative social climate. Still, a wealth of woman's writing emerged - most noticeably in the rich novels of Jane Austen. Often overlooked in Austen's fiction is its subtle yet biting social critique, criticism which mirrors the author's personal conflicts on account of her gender. Thus, the difficult social position of late eighteenth-century English women can be described in greater detail as we delve into Jane Austen's personal and professional lives - and their fascinating intersection.

"The destruction of the World Trade Center, one of the most potent symbols of global westernization, by Al Qaeda, a transnational terrorist network, revealed more powerfully than any academic study could, how radically the boundaries of social and political life are changing. But terrorism is not the only social process that transcends national boundaries. Transnational social movements are mobilizing cross-border constituencies around issues of global concern such as human rights, the environment, and epidemic disease. Pan-Muslim, Hindu, and evangelical Christian activism suggest the emergence of transnational religiously based civil societies which transcend nation states. And increasing numbers of migrants stay connected to their home countries at the same time that they establish themselves in the countries that receive them.

"On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order tt9066 authorizing the eviction of all Japanese and Americans of Japanese ancestry from their homes and businesses on the West coast of the United States. Subsequently, 110,000 people were forced to relocate to government-constructed camps. This action made them the victims of some of the most blatant constitutional and civil rights violations in American history. Following their emancipation at the conclusion of World War II, internment camp survivors chose to remain silent about their captivity for fifty years. Recently, many have broken that silence.

"The goal of this study was to characterize the acid stress response in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 and to compare cultures in the exponential and stationary phases of growth. Growth studies indicated that log-phase cultures of Synechocystis are incapable of growth in environments with a pH less than 6. Cells stressed at pH values greater than 6 had similar growth rates to nonacid stressed cells. However, acid stressed cultures had a lower viability than nonstressed cells. Gel electrophoresis and autoradiography suggested that several proteins were differentially synthesized in response to acid stress: the synthesis of phycocyanin was down-regulated while the synthesis of at least two proteins, 20kDa and lOkDa, was up-regulated. To compare non\xc2\xadstressed exponential and stationary phase cells, the OD750 and the concentration of cells in each culture were measured.

These extracts were then examined using 1 H NMR spectroscopy. It was found that different stress conditions caused the cells to use different methods of incorporation of nitrogen into cyanophycin, and that overall cyanophycin levels varied across conditions.

"""Phycocyanin is a blue photosynthetic protein and nitrogen storage molecule found in cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria degrade phycocyanin during nitrogen starvation and synthesize it upon nitrogen refeeding. Since phycocyanin absorbs light at 620 nm, visible spectroscopy can be used to measure the amount of phycocyanin in cells. Parameters of cell breakage were determined in order to prepare samples with distinct phycocyanin absorbance. Visible spectroscopy studies showed that phycocyanin regeneration began about 6 hours after refeeding and was complete by about 24 hours. Nitrogen starvation experiments using 14N and 15N followed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy on phycocyanin would yield more precise data on the protein's source of nitrogen than visible spectroscopy can provide. Although phycocyanin is too large for NMR analysis, its chromophore, phycocyanobilin, can be cleaved and purified. Currently, we are preparing to characterize the 1 H NMR spectrum of phycocyanobilin using 2D-NMR. The parameters for a nitrogen starvation experiment involving phycocyanin are also being established.

"Killer whales, Orcinus orca, are the second largest whale in the Suborder Odontocetes. They are capable of producing a wide variety of sounds - squeaks, whistles, clicks, and grunts. Several papers have been written on the differences in calls produced by different familial groups of both resident and transient killer whales but calls could not be attributed to individual whales within these families. The goal of my research has been to process a large collection of recorded sounds into a collection of individual whale calls. In 1998, Dr. Patrick Miller of Woods Hole recorded a large number of calls from Northern resident whales living off the coast of British Columbia. He used an array of sixteen hydrophones so that the origin of a particular call can be found by measuring the distance between the call and each of the hydrophones. Combining this information with the visual data about the positions of whales around the boat, we can isolate calls to specific whales. Dr. Miller has written a set of computer programs that combine the acoustic recordings and surface locations into a visual spectrogram, where the calls appear as bright red or yellow marks on a blue background. These calls can then be digitally cut from the recording and modeled quantitatively using a pitch contour program developed for the human voice. All processed calls are then compiled in a corpus of killer whale calls. Hopefully in the future this data can be analyzed to understand more closely the interactions of killer whales. '"

"Projection neurons are born throughout life in the olfactory system of the lobster Homarus americanus. The development of these neurons and of the olfactory system is influenced by the neurotransmitter serotonin. Although mature olfactory projection neurons do not express this neurotransmitter, previous research has shown that some newborn projection neurons are transiently able to take up serotonin. We wanted to determine whether the new neurons are synthesizing serotonin transiently. To do this, we used the presence of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5\xc2\xadHTP), a precursor to serotonin, as a marker for cells that synthesize serotonin. In embryos, cells in the proliferation zone have been found that label for both serotonin and 5-HTP, suggesting that serotonin synthesis is indeed occurring. The size and position of the cells corre\xc2\xadspond to those of the stem cells that give rise to the new olfactory projection neurons. These results lend further support for the theory of serotonergic control of life-long neurogenesis. '"

"In the local universe, quasars are found to live in the center of galaxies. Studies of such ""host galaxies"" have shown that the galaxy luminosity grows in proportion to the mass of the central black hole that constitutes the quasar. One theory based on cosmological modeling predicts that at far distances, and hence early times in the universe, host galaxies will be found with much smaller luminosities. However, if the trend seen locally holds for more distant quasars as well, host galaxies should increase in luminosity. To constrain these models, we needed to observe quasars at much greater distances than was previously possible. We have used the 6.5m Magellan telescope in Chile to obtain infrared images of eight quasars at a cosmological redshift of four. We have analyzed the images to determine whether or not host galaxies were observable, and if so, which luminosity trend they supported. '"
"""Why do some colleges and universities have more developed recycling programs than others? There are many factors that influence the creation of a successful recycling program, and many more that affect how the program is maintained on campus. Suburban campuses tend to have lower rates of recycling than rural or urban schools, and women's colleges are least likely to have an effective recycling program, if one exists at all.

Next, we compared each subject's total hassle score with positive and negative coping styles. We found that students with a high level of hassles tended to use negative academic coping strategies, which was predictive of a lower sense of general well-being. A high level of hassles also predicted the use of negative social coping strategies. Furthermore, the use of positive social coping strategies predicted an enhanced sense of well-being. """

What happens when a nation of people is denied a national state? And when a state denies the existence of a nation of people?

"Cyanobacteria are ancient organisms, able to survive under many stressful conditions, including nitrogen deficiency. They accumulate nitrogen in the storage polymers  phycocyanin  and  cyanophycin. To understand the mechanism of nitrogen storage in  cyanobacteria  we have examined several steps in nitrogen metabolism. Two strains of cyanobacteria were grown after nitrogen stress to identify at what point phycocyanin, a molecule involved in light harvesting, is synthesized. These strains were also regrown in lSN after nitrogen stress so that NMR spectroscopy could be used to determine whether the phycocyanin is made wit h nitrogen from within the cell or from the external medium. Utilization of some nitrogen sources requires the conversion of nitrate to ammonium. To determine at which point this pathway is activated , the activity of the enzyme nitrate reductase was measured after cells were grown under nitrogen starvation conditions and refed .

Previous studies have shown that when cells of 6803 are transferred to pH 4, they survive and the pH of the unbuffered medium shows an immediate rise above pH 6. It was hypothesized that cells may be excreting a substance that causes a rise in pH. Colorimetric ammonium assays performed on the medium of acid stressed cells showed an increase in ammonium concentration over time. Organisms that possess an ATR are able, after a mild or moderate pH shock, to survive extreme pHs. Results of ATR experiments suggest that 6803 lacks this survival mechanism.

Specifically, the interactions between cyclins and cyclin-dependant kinases (Cdks) serve to localize an active kinase to substrates in different regions of the cell. An example of this differential localization is being explored in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dividing yeast possess a unique structure at the mother\xc2\xad bud neck: a septin ring. This ring forms an hour glass shape just beneath the cytoplasm, and serves as a scaffold for proteins important for bud morphogenesis and cytokinesis. One protein known to localize to the septin ring is Clb2, the primary mitotic cyclin. Clb2 is recruited to the bud neck by the Bud3 protein. During G2 and M phase of the cell cycle, Clb2 binds to and activates the yeast Cdk, Cdc28. The existence of direct biochemical interactions between Bud3-Cdc28 or Clb2- Cdc28-Bud3 are currently being explored.

I n order to develop potential therapeutics, it is necessary to understand the source of protein misfolding. The approach utilized here is to strengthen the backbone hydro\xc2\xad gen bonding of a 12-residue peptide known to assume a -hairpin structure by replacing one of the amide bonds with a thioamide bond. The amino acids in the \xc2\xad hairpin sequence H2N-Arg-Tyr-Val-Glu\xc2\xad Val-dPro-Gly-Orn-Lys-lle-Leu-tjJCS-NHGl n-NH2 were coupled using standard solid phase peptide synthesis. The thioamide bond was incorporated into the sequence by replacing the amide oxygen in Fmoc\xc2\xad Leu with a sulfur and forming a nitrobenzotriazole leaving group on the C-terminus. Mass spectrometry has confirmed the successful synthesis of the thiopeptide, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies will be used to investigate the conformational effects of strengthened hydrogen bonding on the \xc2\xad hairpin.

"The nucleoside adenosine is involved in a range of biological functions , from nucleoside biosynthesis  to viral mRNA-capping. By creating an analogue of adenosine, the enzymes involved in these functions can be inhibited , resulting in antiviral and anticancer activity. In order to create desired adenosine analogues, nucleophilic addition of either a nitrogen or a cyano group onto C-3 of 3-bromo-4-substituted- 1,2,4-triazole  (1)  was necessary. Generation of a triazolium intermediate (via oxidation or alkylation of a nitrogen adjacent to the halide) gives easy displacement of the halide, but difficult conversion to the desired products. Direct nucleophilic  aromatic  substitution  onto the triazole using KCN in DMF, gives 3-cyano- 4-phenyl - 1,2,4-triazole (2), but in very low yield . Use of CuCN, on the other hand, gives a much more efficient displacement, most likely due to complexation of the copper to the adjacent nitrogen . Reduction can then be performed by catalytic hydrogenation. The synthesis of 2 as well as further reactions of this compound will be discussed.

"""Thimet Oligopeptidase, EC 3.4.24.15 (TOP) is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that is distributed throughout the body. This enzyme has a variety of substrates including the blood pressure regulator, bradykinin. Since it is able to accommodate a large number of substrates, TOP is thought to have a flexible active site. We have used the denaturant, urea, to study the flexibility of the active site in binding different substrates. The activity and stability of TOP monomers, dimers, and multimers were examined. The substrates used were a fluorogenic version of bradykinin and a smaller fluorogenic substrate. It was shown in these  studies that the enzyme in dimeric and multimeric conformation  denatures  with  increasing urea concentrations but loses activity at different rates for the different substrates . By comparing the activity of the enzyme forms using both substrates , we were able to conclude that TOP flexibility , as modeled by unfolding in urea, allows binding of a variety of substrates.

"""Clinical studies have suggested a correlation between long-term medical use  of adrenergic beta-agonists and heart failure. lsoproterenol, an adrenergic beta-agonist, has been shown to induce apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes after 24- and 48-hour continuous treatment. A similar experiment was conducted to examine the effects of Isoproterenol after four- and eight-hour treatment using electron and light microscopy . Experimental white male rats were implanted with a subcutaneous osmotic pump delivering three mg. Isoproterenol/kg/day. Control animals received saline vehicle alone. After four or eight hours, cardiac tissue was fixed and processed by standard methods and viewed by light and electron microscopy. Electron microscopy revealed subtle changes in cardiomyocytes after the four\xc2\xad hour treatment. Apoptosis became much more pronounced in the animals treated for eight hours, including large intercellular spaces, cell surface blebbing and mitochondrial condensation . Depletion of glycogen was apparent in both experimental groups. Additionally, the most pronounced signs of apoptosis were observed close to blood vessels, possibly indicating concentration gradient effects. In conclusion, there is a suggestion that beta -agonists can induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes after as little as four hours of treatment. (Supported by the Georgeanne Miller Mulhern Fund .)

"""The international system has changed rapidly over the past century. Because of an increase in transnational  corporations and international organizations, globalization has facilitated new levels of interaction across state borders , affecting both states' international and domestic policies. As companies in this new international economy compete, they are drawn to places where the cost of development is competition, the tonnage of ships registered in traditional maritime states has decreased while the tonnage in open (and less heavily regulated) registers has increased dramatically. There is significant variation in how different states respond domestically to these open registers.

"The writing of memoir is both exhilarating and troubling. It is exhilarating to step back into one\'s memories , to pull from the past forgotten details, and to shape these memories into a compelling narrative. Yet the writing of memoir also brings with it troubling questions of memory concerning truth - what responsibility do we have in relating the truth of our experiences, we often ask? In this presentation, we will read excerpts from our memoirs, then lead a discussion about this genre of writing . The following topics will be integral to our discussion: How do the stories we tell about ourselves and each oilier shape our identities? In what way do we create ourselves through the stories we tell? I s t here a ""truth "" in our experiences to which we must remain faithful ? We hope that with these questions we will jumpstart a lively discussion about the writing of memoir.'"

"Vodou, one of the predominant religions of the Haitian people, and Candomble, Vodou\'s equivalent in Brazil, were born of the encounter between African and Western religious traditions and practices. Beginning in the sixteenth century, the people from West and Central Africa brought to the Americas several closely related religious traditions, which were then synchronized with Western religions. In both Vodou and Candomble, one of the central elements of the ritual is music. Music creates the appropriate atmosphere, accompanies the songs and prayers directed to the spirits , supports the dances related to each deity, and most importantly, it is believed to facilitate possession - one of the goals of the ceremony. This presentation gives the audience a brief overview of the importance and the role of music in ceremonies of Vodou and Candomble. Walking in the Mist: China\'s Minority Policies Overcast Authentic Minority Dance Ching Jen Lum \'04, Chinese Studies ADVI SOR : William A. Joseph, Political Science and Yuan-Chu Ruby Lam, Chinese Shortly after coming to power in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party sent cadres to ethnic minority villages to collect folk songs and dances promoting acceptance and understanding between China\'s 55 minority groups and the ""Han"" majority. The start of the Cultural Revolution (1966- 1976) ended all teaching of minority dance in major cities in favor of revolutionary ballets ; only later did the collection and teaching resume. Prestigious dance academies in the cities recruited amateur performers from the villages . These academies also established a broad minority dance curriculum. Locally in the villages, theaters were built to house minority dance performances. Has this push toward professionalization truly benefited the minorities? Or does current policy further extend the power of the Chinese government , while hindering the authenticity of minority folk dance? My presentation examines the history of China\'s minority policies, particularly their influence over minority dance, and the future of authentic minority existence .

Most about lost love; all about loss."" As a majority of Koreans in Korea empathize in such a manner when listening to this national folk song, ""Arirang"" is still undeniably the song of the Korean people. Its meaning has been shaped by the experiences of the people and the nation throughout history. Today, ""Arirang "" is sung at almost every event in which the Korean spirit is represented , and inspires the names of numerous Korean shops and restaurants worldwide .

A Gendered Identity Crisis: Masculinity and Religious Practice in Puritan New England Anne Catherine Savage '04, History and Classical Civilization"""
"""Although men and women worshipped together in early New England, the sexes experienced religion in strikingly different ways. Puritan men faced a profound and gendered identity crisis in which they were forced to come to terms with the intersection , and oftentimes collision , of their secular and religious selves. I used men's diaries, conversion narratives , poetry , and sermons as lenses through which to explore masculinity in Puritan New England at four critical life stages: marriage and the creation of a family, the conversion process leading to church membership , the call to an occupation , and facing death . Even though Puritan men were sure to confront strain in fulfilling their masculine roles in both the religious and secular spheres, these roles were not mutually exclusive. In most cases, men were able to develop effective coping mechanisms to manage their internal struggles with the matter of their masculinity . (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship.) Changing Waters: Infant Baptism during the Reformation Audrey Fergason '04, History and Religion"""
"""On the eve of the Protestant Reformation , the issue at the forefront of theologians ' minds was not infant baptism. The definition of this sacrament, though highly contested in the infancy of the church , had been a settled issue for over three centuries . However, during the Reformation, the questions of whether infants should be baptized and the efficacy of infant baptism as a sacrament were highly debated. From the Anabaptists in Switzerland to the Lutherans in the Northern German state to the Calvinists in parts of France and Switzerland, each reforming group interpreted infant baptism differently . How did these theologians view infant baptism and what did it mean to their followers? Why was infant baptism such a point of contention among the various reforming traditions? How did the sacrament of infant baptism change during the course of the Reformation ? My research focuses on the writings of reforming theologians including Luther, Calvin, Menno , and Sattler as well as others. I attempt to discover how the understanding of infant baptism changed , why it was such a volatile issue, and why these debates over infant baptism often ended in bloodshed ."""
"""Natural differences in stable isotope abundance (13c;l2c; 1SN;l4N) can be used to infer animal diets. Carbon isotope ratios (1113C) reflect the plants at the base of an animal's food chain: c4 plants (e.g. corn, sugar cane) have the highest 1113c, whereas c3 plants (e.g. Wheat, soybeans) have the lowest 1113c. Nitrogen isotope ratios (1115N) increase with each step up a food chain. We analyzed 1113c and 1115N in a fingernail sample from each student. Students reported their three top dietary protein sources. We ranked those sources by predicted 1113c and 1115N, and plotted these weighted rankings against actual 1113c and 1115N. Fingernail isotopes were highly correlated with dietary ran kings. The class reflected a mix of C3/C4 plants, and a trophic level's range of 1115N (with the vegan the lowest).

By some estimates, WNV killed almost half of the bird population in some states . Intensive spraying campaigns were implemented to control  mosquito  populations  with un known impacts on bird populations. Despite funding spent on studying WNV, the virus' long-term effects harbor the potential for ecological disaster. Will spraying campaigns mitigate this damage or merely embellish it?

Phosphorus Levels in Lake Waban before and after the Paintshop Pond Cleanup"""
"""Phosphorus is one of the key elements necessary for life. In freshwater bodies, phosphorus is usually the limiting nutrient, and when it is present in excess amounts, it often causes water quality problems and algal blooms. Lakes that receive excess phosphorus and exhibit algal blooms are called eutrophic. Recently, the Paintshop Pond area was renovated , and a new wetland was planted there. Lake Waban is adjacent to the disturbed area, and it is al ready mildly eutrophic due to drainage from a large suburban watershed. Ten years ago, a phosphorus budget was constructed by Pavla Zakova '94. That phosphorus budget will be compared to a contemporary budget using data collected within the last year. In this presentation, results of the new phosphorus budget will be discussed in light of the current health of Lake Waban, the effects of soil disturbance due to the Paintshop Pond cleanup, and the possible 'sponge' quality of the restored wetland.

"""Biological Sciences and Nancy H. Kolodny, Chemistry Synaptic Alterations in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome Liz Storer '04, Neuroscience Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a developmental disorder that affects about 1 in 10,000 females. RTT is characterized by normal postnatal development until six to 18 months of age, when mental retardation and progressive motor dysfunction become apparent. Most RTT cases are associated with mutations to the X-linked gene encoding MeCP2 , a transcriptional repressor. Although it is unclear how this mutation causes RTT, researchers theorize that the mutated MeCP2 protein fails to repress genes controlling synaptic pruning during critical developmental period s. We will test this hypothesis in a mouse model of RTT in which the MeCP2 gene is deleted . We will determine whether MeCP2 -deficient mice have decreased synaptic density in the brain by measuring levels of synaptophysin, a presynaptic vesicle protein . We will measure synaptophysin staining density in cerebral cortex in MeCP2 -deficient vs. control mice. Eventually, we hope to correlate cortical synaptic density with behavioral performance in the mutant mice. Rett-like Symptoms in MeCP2 Mutant Mice at Different Developmental Stages Olive Mwizenua '04, Neuroscience and Rebecca Yang 'OS, Biological Sciences Our project aim is two fold . First , we aim to determine how early in postnatal development we are able to detect physical/behavioral characteristics of RTT in a mouse model. Second , we aim to characterize cognitive and anxiety-like behaviors exhibited in these mice as adults. We have used the Fox neonatal battery to assess physical, reflex , and social development of the mutant mice between two and 18 days after birth . We have also examined anxiety and exploratory behaviors using an open field task and an elevated-zero maze on mice ranging in age from five weeks to nine months. Data from these measures have shown delayed reflex development and alterations in social behaviors in the neonatal mutant mice as compared to controls. There are also alterations in anxiety-related behaviors and cognitive behaviors in the adult mice reminiscent of the human condition. In Vivo MR Imaging and Spectroscopy in MeCP2 Mutant Mice Brittany Yerby 'OS, Chemistry and JaeYoung You 'OS, Chemistry Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) provide a noninvasive method to obtain anatomical and chemical information from living tissue. We are developing in vivo MRI techniques to be used at 9.4T to examine structural changes in the brains of MeCP2 mutant mice. MRI data provide information about volumetric changes in specific brain regions. In addition, 1H MRS techniques are being developed to determine the biochemical changes that occur in the first few weeks of life in the mutant  mice. Changes in levels of brain metabolites and neurochemicals in different brain regions determined from these spectra will allow us to track the onset and progress of the disease. The data collected from MRI and MRS techniques will increase our under- standing of the nature of this neurodevelopmental disorder and may prove to be a noninvasive early detection method . Does Prenatal Choline Supplementation Improve Memory? Lauren Brownlee 'OS, Classics and Africana Studies and Shoshana Maxwell '06 Prenatal choline (a precursor for acetyl\xc2\xad choline and a methyl donor) supplementation has been shown previously to improve spatial learning and memory in the offspring rats and mice. These effects are long-lasting, and memory improvements are still apparent when the offspring reach old age ( > 18 months). In the current study, we want to examine if improvements in performance extend to another type of learning, namely classical conditioning. Fear conditioning is a test in which the mouse learns to associate a footshock with a tone (cue) and with the place (context) in which the shock is received. Because of specific brain structures involved in different types of learning, we hypothesize that prenatal choline supplementation will improve fear conditioning to a context, but not necessarily to a cue. In the future, we hope to test the efficacy of this prenatal treatment in conditions such as RTT and Alzheimer 's Disease.

This study investigates the presence of aggression among characters in contemporary teen movies , with a focus on the ways in which female adolescents use social aggression .

"Program, Stone Center In recent years, many schools have implemented social-competency programs in the hopes of creating positive classroom environments. However, many programs are quickly discarded after initial enthusiasm wanes. In such a climate, how can good programs survive to successfully affect students? This presentation is based on a study that assessed features contributing to the sustained use of Open Circle, a social competency program based at the Stone Center. Factors were identified that appear to lead to ongoing use of such curriculum . These findings have implication s on larger questions of social change efforts in schools.

"Throughout history, the spoken word has inspired people to commit acts of unspeakable terror and unparalleled good. But it is not just the content of the words that motivates individuals to act; it is the art of dramatic expression. In this artistic presentation, I will read several pieces of poetry, but my primary focus will be on the power of vocal in\xef\xac\x82ection to express ideas. I will be utilizing the dramatic art of vocalization and using theatrical techniques of modulation accompanied by physical expression to perform poetry as monologues. The goal of this project will be to craft poetry and to study the dramatic art of the monologue, and in the conjoined study of these two art forms, I will recite poetry with the effect and power of performing words.'"
"A good short story is a strange creature, a taut form where every component must contribute to the whole, a brief immersion in a world that then stays with the reader long after the story is put away. After a brief introduction discussing the beauty and oddity of the short story I will read an excerpt from my collection Dispatches. My aim for the reading is, foremost, to engage and entertain, though I should give fair warning that the stories tend to portray urban and suburban disenchantment and disconnect. Thus far stories in the collection deal with the hit and run death of a suburban mother, the experiences of a journalist covering a policeman\xe2\x80\x99s sudden descent into violence, and the emotional journey of a grieving daughter. Though not overtly sharing a theme, the stories explore the varied ways communities form and the surprising results of unlikely connections.'"
"Identity, alienation, and transnationality are just a few of the obstacles Asian American poets confront in the poems to which we pay tribute. These poems represent a variety of ethnicities, times, and experiences but share the understanding of what it means to be a part of a hyphenated race. While today\xe2\x80\x99s struggle is to identify as Asian American, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s was to identify as American-Asian. We address common questions such as: Where is home?, Am I authentic?, and Do I pass? as we acknowledge the important distinctions between generations, and discover ways in which previous generations\xe2\x80\x99 struggles remain applicable to life today.'"
"The differences between modern and classical Japanese are vast, including grammar, vocabulary, and the style of the poetry and prose. It is almost as if the two were completely different languages. Yet, the complexity and depth of the classical literary texts only add to their appeal. What problems arise in the process of translation? What themes are prevalent? What outside knowledge about the times is necessary? We will discuss such topics as ambiguity in Japanese, the disappearing subject, and the dif\xef\xac\x81culty of preserving the style of the original, using excerpts from The Pillow Book, Manyoshu, Kokinshu, and others.'"

"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) is an agonist which binds to a pancreatic G protein coupled receptor, initiating insulin production, and thereby mediating the blood glucose levels of the body. The N-terminal histidine residue of GLP-1 is essential for activation of the target receptor (GLP-1R). The CCK inhibitor T-0632 inhibits the binding of GLP-1 to GLP-1R. Binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R involves residues of GLP-1R which are known to be required for activation. We are investigating the use of T-0632 as a nonpeptide delivery agent for small molecule agonists, such as histidine, to the activation site of the receptor. Preliminary results of biological screening will be reported.'"
"Studies of peptide agonists with cell membrane receptors have shown that, in rare cases, the agonist can be added in two fragments which together produce activation of the receptor. In order to study the mechanism by which this activation occurs, we have prepared \xef\xac\x82uorescent and quenching amino acids to be incorporated into the agonist fragments. These can be used to detect proximity of the agonist fragments in solution and/or upon interaction with the receptor. Synthesis of the coumarin based \xef\xac\x82uorescent amino acid and the quenching amino acid will be discussed, as will the results of biological screening.'"
"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a 30 residue peptide involved in glucose-mediated insulin production. Exendin-4 (Ex-4), a 39 residue peptide found in Gila monster venom, was found to be an agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Data from binding and activation assays of GLP-1 point mutants suggest that GLP-1 and Ex-4 have distinct and discrete receptor, activating regions and receptor-binding regions. We are examining the separability of these functions by truncating Ex-4 at the N-terminus and using a nonpeptide attachment to connect model small agonists to the binding region. The \xef\xac\x81rst agonists studied use the natural N-terminal tripeptide molecule to show that we can preserve activation with such an attachment. Synthetic strategy and binding and activity data on the model compounds will be presented. (Research supported by NSF REU.)'"
"The N-terminal histidine of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and of exendin-4 have been shown to be critical for the activation of the pancreatic receptor (GLP-1R) which initiates insulin production. Previous amino acid substitutions of this histidine with lysine and with alanine have been interpreted to indicate the requirement for a positively charged residue in the N-terminal position. To further develop the structure-activity relationship for the interaction of the N-terminal amino acid of GLP-1 with GLP-1R, histidine analogs such as 1-imidazolyl-alanine (1), have been synthesized via Michael addition to an acrylic acid ester. Enantiomeric resolution was achieved enzymatically. The results of binding and activity studies for the incorporation of 1 and other such analogs into GLP-1 will be reported.

"The protein polymer glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been shown to indirectly lower blood glucose levels in patients suffering from Type II diabetes. This effect is only observed when GLP-1 is bound to its receptor, GLP-1R. Understanding the molecular level interactions of GLP-1 and GLP-1R will allow for the targeted design of medicinal treatments for Type II diabetes. Synthesis of a histidine analog \xe2\x80\x93 a modi\xef\xac\x81ed component of GLP-1 that acts as a probe \xe2\x80\x93 can elucidate speci\xef\xac\x81c interactions between GLP-1 and GLP-1R.

"Studies have shown that peptide GLP-1 induces the production of insulin in the human body as it binds and activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), making it a promising method of treatment for diabetes mellitus. However, GLP-1 is short lived in vivo, thus it is necessary to \xef\xac\x81nd binding, nonpeptide small molecule activators of GLP-1R. Although the non peptide antagonist T-0632 (1) inhibits the release of insulin, the selective binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R makes T-0632 a potential lead compound for diabetes treatment. We have developed an ef\xef\xac\x81cient synthesis of racemic T-0632. The resolution of T-0632 enantiomers has been attempted in two synthetic strategies via reaction with chiral alcohol to form diastereomers. Further details of the synthesis and chiral resolution will be discussed. (Research supported by the Merck SURF Program.)'"

"Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is an enzyme important in the regulation of blood pressure and neurological processes. It is suspected that TOP can metabolize an unusually wide range of substrates due to a \xef\xac\x82exible binding loop. In our study, small glycine (Gly) residues in the loop were replaced with larger, less \xef\xac\x82exible alanines (Ala). The activities of three mutants, Gly599Ala, Gly603Ala, and Gly604Ala, were compared to that of wild-type enzyme. All three enzymes had lower activity than wild-type towards a large substrate. However, towards a smaller substrate, Gly603Ala was the most active, surpassing even wild type. Gly604Ala had little activity towards either substrate. These results are consistent with earlier enzyme unfolding studies. Low concentrations of the denaturant urea led to lower activity of both wild type and mutant enzymes toward the smaller substrate, but increased activity towards the larger substrate.

"Many aquatic vertebrates are capable of enduring prolonged periods with little or no access to environmental oxygen. The gold\xef\xac\x81sh (Carassius auratus), for example, can survive and remain active for as long as 5 days in water with no oxygen at all! Our overall hypothesis was that the activation of speci\xef\xac\x81c potassium ion channels in critical tissues is one factor that enhances survival under low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions in this species. We used intracellular recording techniques to characterize a hypoxia-induced increase in the activity of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) ion channels in the heart, to resolve the mechanism by which this change takes place, and speci\xef\xac\x81cally, to assess the role of nitric oxide (NO) in channel activation. During moderate hypoxia in tissue bath, KATP channels on the outer surface of cardiac muscle cells were activated. Our data support a role for NO in channel activation, potentially enhancing the tolerance of this species to environmental stress. (Supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.)'"
"Our diets are full of natural amino acids, so one might question why we want to modify them. The fact is, nothing is wrong with the 20 \xe2\x80\x9cnaturally occurring\xe2\x80\x9d amino acids, but unnatural amino acids have proven themselves to be extremely useful. When an amino acid is modi\xef\xac\x81ed by thioxylation, in which the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a sulfur atom, the resulting peptide may show an increase in enzymatic stability and potency, which would be helpful in designing drugs. We are inserting a thiomide linkage into a beta-hairpin to gain an understanding of how the secondary structure surrounding the thiomide is affected. This information is essential in order for thioxylated amino acids to be useful as tools in protein design, and in the study of the relation-ship between structure and function in proteins and peptides.

"Clinical studies have suggested a correlation between long-term use of adrenergic beta-agonists and heart failure. Isoproterenol, an adrenergic beta-agonist used clinically as bronchial dilator was shown to induce apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes after 24- and 48-hours at 3mg/kg/day. Other non apoptotic morphological and metabolic changes were also evident. The present study was undertaken to quantify these non apoptotic changes that are believed to contribute to the overall decline in cardiac function. In addition, Northern Blot was performed to understand the protein synthesis pro\xef\xac\x81le of adrenergically challenged cells as Isoproterenol was shown to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Experimental male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a subcutaneous osmotic pump delivering 3mg/kg/day isoproterenol continuously. After 24- and 72-hour stimulation, hearts were excised. Glycogen, a cardiac myosin heavy chain, and mRNA were quanti\xef\xac\x81ed or semi quanti\xef\xac\x81ed. Glycogen depletion was con\xef\xac\x81rmed.

"During plant cytokinesis, the last phase of cellular division, membrane traf\xef\xac\x81cking is central to the construction of the cell plate which separates the two daughter cells. Protein function is critical for vesicle traf\xef\xac\x81cking to the developing cell plate. Patellin1 (PATL1) belongs to a family of Arabidopsis proteins characterized by a variable N-terminal domain followed by Sec14 and GOLD domains, which are commonly found in other membrane traf\xef\xac\x81cking proteins. Previous research suggests that PATL1 is recruited to the expanding and maturing cell plate, where it is believed to serve a critical function. Approaches being taken to investigate protein interactions of two members of the patellin family, PATL1 and PATL2, include pull-down assays with clathrin and yeast two-hybrid screens. Phenotypes of PATL1 and PATL2 knockout mutants are being studied to determine if these proteins are required for normal cytokinesis and development.

"The World Health Organization estimates that there are eight million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) per year, resulting in some two million deaths annually. Given the concurrent HIV epidemic, the situation with TB infection will only get worse in high incidence countries. There is a further complicating problem of Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) in many parts of the world. Improved therapy for both susceptible TB and MDRTB will require the development of new drugs for better treatment. We now report on new compounds that represent attractive leads for development as potential agents for therapy of MDRTB; for example, we have prepared new thioureas derived from meta-aminophenol. These compounds were prepared in good yields and purity, using methods of synthetic organic chemistry and will be tested for their activity against the causative agent of TB infection, Myobacterium tuberculosis.

"Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) hydrolyzes various peptides and regulates several neurological and physiological processes. A cleft separates the two domains of TOP and contains the substrate-binding pocket and active site. A loop region, which is thought to be quite \xef\xac\x82exible, connects the domains; changes in the loop may lead to modi\xef\xac\x81cations in substrate speci\xef\xac\x81city. To trap intermediate conformations of the loop, glycine residues within the active site were replaced with larger, less \xef\xac\x82exible alanine residues. The activity of the mutants was compared to that of wild-type enzyme towards two quenched \xef\xac\x82uorescent substrates. All mutants had lower activity than wild type towards a natural substrate analog, but towards a smaller substrate one mutant had higher activity. These results are consistent with data that revealed increases in activity towards the larger substrate when the enzyme is partially denatured, and presumably more \xef\xac\x82exible, in addition to data revealing conformational changes under denaturing conditions.

"The ability of plants to accumulate materials into their tissues can be utilized to sequester heavy metals from soil. By identifying hyperaccumulating plants, a remediation strategy can be developed for areas that require a low-budget solution. The communities of Roxbury and Dorchester, MA are areas where backyard gardening, a centerpiece of local culture, is plagued by lead contaminated soil. Our goal is to implement a neighborhood-wide phytoremediation scheme to remove lead from soil. In a greenhouse study, we examined the bioavailability of lead to plants and the impact of the initial concentration of lead in soil on uptake. We planted mustards and sun\xef\xac\x82owers, known hyperaccumulators, in soil with lead concentrations of 1400 to 2200 ppm and we hope to quantify the root and foliar uptake of lead for both species. In a separate study, we plan to measure 207Pb/ 206Pb ratios in size fractionated soil using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy to \xef\xac\x81ngerprint the sources of urban lead contamination.'"

"In the late nineteenth century, Jane Addams became renowned for the establishment of Hull House in Chicago, an experiment in social reform, but she was not alone in the development of the Settlement House movement. On the East Coast, a group of college women was setting up its own houses in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston. Led by Vida Dutton Scudder, these female professors and students settled in slums in an attempt to close the ever-widening social class gap. In 1892, Scudder, with Emily Greene Balch, founded Denison House in Boston\xe2\x80\x99s South End. It was not their intention to become involved in reform politics initially, but after only a few months they could not avoid it. This talk looks at the development of Denison House into a center for female labor reform in Boston, and eventually, the movement of Scudder and Balch into the wider spectrum of reform causes.

The quantitative and qualitative data from these surveys yielded interesting differences between students in classes that include a self-assessment component and those that do not. As Wellesley deals with new grading policies, this study suggests the importance of including students in the evaluative process.'"

"Imprisonment is not meant to be pleasant. As a deterrent and punishment, jail time was designed to be a negative experience for the offender. However, incarceration may permanently decrease future income and employment prospects. The war on drugs and \xe2\x80\x9ctough on crime\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing guidelines have caused incarceration rates to grow exponentially. What does this mean for our society as a whole? If offenders face bad labor market prospects, they may be discouraged from entering the legitimate economy and become more likely to reoffend. Our criminal justice system may not be rehabilitating people, but creating a culture of cyclical imprisonment \xe2\x80\x93 which prevents a signi\xef\xac\x81cant portion of the population from contributing to our economy and generates in\xef\xac\x81nite incarceration costs for taxpayers.

"On October 3, 2002, 17-year-old Gwen Araujo was beaten to death by four ex-classmates, who then dumped her body in a deserted area in California. Minutes before the attack, the four perpetrators found out that Gwen had been born male and was transgendered. The discovery of this fact resulted in a violent retaliation that cost Gwen her life. My research seeks to answer why violence and hate is repeatedly aimed at transgendered, genderqueer, and transexual Americans. By sharing the stories of Boston-area trans/genderqueer people who have experienced verbal and physical violence, in tandem with literature on gender violence, I hope to demonstrate that antitransgender violence is part of a more general social hate pattern. These events are extreme manifestations of the gender policing/enforcement that touch all of our lives, everyday.'"
"Cross-cultural psychology indicates that not all cultures construe the self similarly. In collectivistic cultures, there is a strong value placed on connectedness between the self and others, leading to an emphasis on group harmony with in-group members. On the other hand, individuals in individualistic societies consider the self to be autonomous in relation to others where establishing one\xe2\x80\x99s independence is strived for. In order to determine whether cultural values affect intracultural and intercultural negotiation processes, 42 cross-cultural empirical studies observing behavior were reviewed. Thirty-\xef\xac\x81ve of these studies examined intracultural negotiations, whereas 10 studies examined intercultural negotiations. In most of the studies, behaviors were consistent and correlated with respective cultural values.

"Forty-eight female undergraduates were presented with a photograph of a couple and a few paragraphs about them and their relationship, and then were asked to complete a questionnaire. The male\xe2\x80\x99s appearance was manipulated in the photo-graph by changing his clothing and level of grooming and his status was manipulated by his description in the text, while the female and the relationship itself were presented consistently in all conditions.

It was consistently found that only status had an impact on the participants\xe2\x80\x99 ratings for each partner. Also, the female was perceived more negatively when her partner was high status and more positively when he was low status.

Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s lack of mass transportation and its economic instability are just two examples showing their plans were greatly \xef\xac\x82awed. Nonetheless, Detroit has emerged from its rut. Campus Martius, the Compuware headquarters, promises to foster commercial growth and bring new light on the nearly forgotten center of the city. The construction of the General Motors World Headquarters is projected to promote more business. Yet, as this city begins to \xef\xac\x82ourish and approach economic stability, its capacity to ef\xef\xac\x81ciently \xe2\x80\x9ccarry\xe2\x80\x9d or sustain a population with all its needs met, is a crucial question. This presentation addresses Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s carrying capacity by utilizing mathematical modeling to explore its social, political, and economic dynamics.'"
"One of the distinguishing characteristics of urban areas is the extent and pattern of land-use density. Some cities, like Boston, have tall buildings and dense residential and employment concentration at the center while others, like Phoenix, are sprawling with a more even and relatively low density of land use everywhere. Over time, many cities have seen growth at the periphery and relatively little in central cities, \xef\xac\x82attening the observed relationship between distance from the center and density of land use. This paper explores empirically the economic causes of land-use density patterns across a very large set of geographical areas.'"
"The Romantic Era, spanning from 1790 to 1910, is characterized by the romance, the imagination, the strange, and the fantastic. The rise of interest in nature and the supernatural led to the range of unique sounds - creating dramatic and emotional melodies. In Vienna, Franz Schubert (1797-1828) helped to propel the Romantic Movement. He wrote over 600 pieces of work, from simple pieces to miniature dramas. His music is suffused with emotion, encompassing the poetic expression characterizing the Romantic ideal. Although much of Schubert\xe2\x80\x99s music is cast in the classical form, he stretched the form in many personal ways in the B-\xef\xac\x82at Piano Trio op. 99, creating a very powerful piece. Continuing the era in Berlin, Felix Mendelssohn (1809 \xe2\x80\x93 1847) was highly in\xef\xac\x82uenced by the works of Bach, Beethoven, and Handel. His works take on similar clarity and classical symmetry in form, yet are infused with a complex and unique depth of melody. The quartet in A minor presents this style, including references to late Beethoven.'"
"Anton Chekhov was a realist, an absurdist, and a master of black comedy. He delighted in the absurd humor of everyday life. His one-person vaudeville \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Harmful Effects of Tobacco\xe2\x80\x9d is unapologetically absurd, and this humor is enhanced by the pathetic believability of its protagonist. For the very reasons they are considered works of beauty and genius, the plays of Anton Chekhov are a challenge both to translate and to perform. Often in translation, the beauty of his prose is sacri\xef\xac\x81ced to render lines as natural and realistic as the originals, or else the speakability is sacri\xef\xac\x81ced to preserve the poetry of the original. Both cases present their own challenges to the performer. In my translation of this play, I have attempted to \xef\xac\x81nd a point between realistic and beautiful language that does justice to the brilliant blending of the two in Chekhov\xe2\x80\x99s Russian.'"
"Plays are often time capsules of the era in which they are written; they re\xef\xac\x82ect and illuminate a society\xe2\x80\x99s ethos. Great plays, however, transcend their time.

My research focuses on Lillian Hellman\xe2\x80\x99s plays, speci\xef\xac\x81cally looking at her revivals of those plays to gauge America\xe2\x80\x99s shifting views on such issues as slander, lesbianism, fascism, and capitalism.'"
"My thesis work explores the art of print-making - primarily lithography, monoprint, and linocut.

"Through a thesis in studio art I have been investigating disposable culture and the role it plays in our everyday lives. Using various photographic and printmaking formats, I am focusing on the path that our trash takes when we throw it away, as well as the commercial and consumer attitudes which reinforce its ongoing presence in our society. By identifying some of the recurring icons and materials that re\xef\xac\x82ect and shape our attitudes on disposability, I am discovering a few of the basic tenets underlying the culture of \xe2\x80\x9ccontainerism\xe2\x80\x9d.

"Ethnicity and group identity are important concepts that give people a sense of ful\xef\xac\x81llment, community, and belonging. However, these ordinarily benign ideas become dangerous when they are manipulated for political purposes, invoked to challenge the security of others, and used to incite con\xef\xac\x82ict. Rei\xef\xac\x81cation of group boundaries and identities on the one hand and ethnic violence on the other become mutually reinforcing, as alterity promotes violence and violence promotes alterity. I seek to determine how the peace processes in Bosnia and Northern Ireland affected the character and quantity of alterity framed in terms of ethnic difference. Did the power-sharing agreements exacerbate ethnic difference and reify formerly \xef\xac\x82uid ethnic identities? Was clari\xef\xac\x81cation and separation of group identity necessary to maintain peace? Ultimately, I seek to examine the intended and unintended effects of these two peace agreements on ethnicity to better understand the limitations and possibilities of ethnic con\xef\xac\x82ict resolution.'"
"The end of apartheid in South Africa in the early 1990s was, in many ways, a political miracle, especially considering the horri\xef\xac\x81c political violence of the mid-1980s. In 1995, the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was created to allow for the \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment of as complete a picture as possible of the nature, causes and extent of gross violations of human rights\xe2\x80\x9d from 1960 to 1994. This presentation will focus on the ways in which South Africans experienced the TRC through testifying, implementing it, reporting on it, or watching national media coverage of it. In the end, what kind of history did the TRC produce and how did these truths affect South Africans? Did the TRC\xe2\x80\x99s history con\xef\xac\x82ict with South Africans\xe2\x80\x99 experiences under the apartheid regime and, if so, what still needs to be done to promote truth and reconciliation in the new South Africa?'"
"While England watched and world war loomed, the profound questions of the divine right of kings, Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s ascendancy, and the ancient philosophical divide between justice and right, all hinged on whether a boy was innocent of stealing a mere \xef\xac\x81ve-shilling postal order and wrongly expelled from the Royal Naval Academy. In 1910, a British court case pitted a 13-year-old English boy against the King of England. Forbidden to sue the Crown, the King was always deemed \xe2\x80\x9cjust,\xe2\x80\x9d even though he may not have been \xe2\x80\x9cright.\xe2\x80\x9d Invoked in this historic case, a centuries-old petition acknowledged the distinction.

"Hydrogels are polymer networks that undergo stimuli-responsive volume phase transitions, in which the gels contract and expel their contents into their surroundings. Control of this behavior has prompted much research for use of hydro-gels as stimuli-responsive drug carriers. My research investigates two modi\xef\xac\x81cations of gel thermoresponsive phase transition: the variation of gel composition and the addition of in situ gold nanoparticles. Gels were synthesized using thermosensitive N-isopropylacrylamide as the polymer backbone and using 0.00-3.50% wt. of N,N\xe2\x80\x99-methylenebisacry-lamide (MBAm) and/or N,N\xe2\x80\x99-cystaminebisacrylamide (CBAm) as crosslinking agents, and were then embedded with in situ gold nanoparticles. UV spectroscopy revealed that the phase transitions of in situ gold samples with high concentrations of CBAm widened the most. Mass and diameter measurements of in situ gold gels with high concentrations of CBAm and low concentrations of MBAm were also substantially larger than gels that had lower concentrations of CBAm and/or higher concentrations of MBAm.

"We have studied the low-energy electron induced reactions of CF2Cl2 andCF2Cl2/H2O thin \xef\xac\x81lms. We are motivated by a hypothesis1, which suggests that cosmic rays bombarding polar stratospheric clouds produce low-energy electrons which interact with chloro\xef\xac\x82uoro carbons to produce chlorine that destroy the Antarctic ozone. The electron-induced reactions of CF2Cl2/H2O \xef\xac\x81lms were designed to simulate CF2Cl2 absorbed on ice in the polar stratospheric clouds. Our methods include post-irradiation temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and electron stimulated desorption. Experiments were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, where CF2Cl2 thin \xef\xac\x81lms were grown at 100 K on a clean Mo(110) surface, or a Mo(110) surface with pre-adsorbed H2O. A mass spectrometer \xef\xac\x81lament was used to irradiate the thin \xef\xac\x81lms with low energy (5-100 eV) electrons. Post irradiation TPD experiments were used to identify C2F4Cl2, C2F3Cl3, C2F2Cl, C2F3Cl, C2F2Cl2, and C2F4 as radiolysis products of CF2Cl2.2 Preliminary results indicated that electron-induced reactions of CF2Cl2/H2O \xef\xac\x81lms produce C2F3Cl3, C2F2Cl4, C2F3Cl, C2F4, and CF3Cl. 1Lu, Q.

"Thermosensitive hydrogels are polymer networks that swell and deswell with temperature changes due to polymer-polymer and polymer-water interactions. Hydrogel copolymers of N-isopropylacry-lamide and acrylic acid, poly(NIPAm-co-AAc), were synthesized with varying concentrations of N,N\xe2\x80\x99-cystaminebisacry-lamide (CBAm) and N,N\xe2\x80\x99-methyl-enebisacrylamide (MBAm) as crosslinking agents. Gold nanostructures were synthesized within the poly (NIPAm-co-AAc) hydrogels. The phase transition temperatures and swelling properties of both the native and gold-containing poly(NIPAm-co-AAc) hydrogels were studied using mass measurements over a range of temperatures. The results of these studies are compared to those of gels without acrylic acid in the polymer backbone. Dried hydrogels were loaded with a \xef\xac\x82uorescent-labeled model drug, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled dextran. TMR-dextran release pro\xef\xac\x81les for the NIPAm-coAAc hydrogels were studied using \xef\xac\x82uorometry.

"The eukaryotic cell cycle is primarily regulated by cyclin-dependant kinases and the many cyclins that differentially associate with the kinases throughout the cell cycle. Subcellular localization of cyclins is known to be an important part of human cell cycle regulation. Previous work in our lab has suggested that cytoplasmic localization of the primary mitotic cyclin, Clb2, has a signi\xef\xac\x81cant role in the regulation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. I am interested in the function of Clb2 localization at the mother-bud neck, a site where regulatory proteins, including the kinase Swe1, are known to congregate. Cells depleted of cytoplasmic Clb2 were found to have elongated buds, which is characteristic of disrupted Swe1 regulation. This study is further investigating the role of Clb2 localization in Swe1 regulation and onset of mitosis. (Research supported by the Robert and Karl Staley Fund and an NSF RUI grant to JHD.)'"
"Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) hydrolyzes various peptides and regulates several neurological and physiological processes. A cleft separates the two domains of TOP and contains the substrate-binding pocket and active site. A loop region, which is thought to be quite \xef\xac\x82exible, connects the domains; changes in the loop may lead to modi\xef\xac\x81cations in substrate speci\xef\xac\x81city. To trap intermediate conformations of the loop, glycine residues within the active site were replaced with larger, less \xef\xac\x82exible alanine residues. The activity of the mutants was compared to that of wild-type enzyme towards two quenched \xef\xac\x82uorescent substrates. All mutants had lower activity than wild type towards a natural substrate analog, but towards a smaller substrate one mutant had higher activity. These results are consistent with data that revealed increases in activity towards the larger substrate when the enzyme is partially denatured, and presumably more \xef\xac\x82exible, in addition to data revealing conformational changes under denaturing conditions.

"The cell cycle is the highly regulated sequence of events that allows for proper DNA replication and correct timing of cell division. Clb2 is the primary yeast mitotic cyclin that controls entry into mitosis by binding and activating the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. It resides predominantly in the nucleus with subpopulations at the mitotic spindle, spindle pole bodies, and the bud neck. Clb2 sub-cellular localization likely contributes to regulation of Clb2/Cdc28 activity and substrate speci\xef\xac\x81city. I conducted a genetic screen and biochemical assays to elucidate the cytoplasmic roles and genetic interactions of Clb2. Knowing with which proteins cytoplasmic Clb2 interacts, we can extrapolate novel roles for Clb2 and the functional signi\xef\xac\x81cance of its nuclear export. By delineating the regulatory mechanisms involved in cell division, this research can aid in the understanding and treatment of tumorigenesis and cancer, which stem from dysfunctions in the cell cycle.

"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) is an agonist which binds to a pancreatic G protein coupled receptor, initiating insulin production, and thereby mediating the blood glucose levels of the body. The N-terminal histidine residue of GLP-1 is essential for activation of the target receptor (GLP-1R). The CCK inhibitor T-0632 inhibits the binding of GLP-1 to GLP-1R. Binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R involves residues of GLP-1R which are known to be required for activation. We are investigating the use of T-0632 as a nonpeptide delivery agent for small molecule agonists, such as histidine, to the activation site of the receptor. Preliminary results of biological screening will be reported.'"

These can be used to detect proximity of the agonist fragments in solution and/or upon interaction with the receptor.

"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a 30 residue peptide involved in glucose-mediated insulin production. Exendin-4 (Ex-4), a 39 residue peptide found in Gila monster venom, was found to be an agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Data from binding and activation assays of GLP-1 point mutants suggest that GLP-1 and Ex-4 have distinct and discrete receptor activating regions and receptor binding regions. We are examining the separability of these functions by truncating Ex-4 at the N-terminus and using a nonpeptide attachment to connect model small agonists to the binding region. The \xef\xac\x81rst agonists studied use the natural N-terminal tripeptide molecule to show that we can preserve activation with such an attachment. Synthetic strategy and binding and activity data on the model compounds will be presented. (Research supported by NSF REU.)'"
"The N-terminal histidine of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and of exendin-4 have been shown to be critical for the activation of the pancreatic receptor (GLP-1R) which initiates insulin production. Previous amino acid substitutions of this histidine with lysine and with alanine have been interpreted to indicate the requirement for a positively charged residue in the N-terminal position. To further develop the structure-activity relationship for the interaction of the N-terminal amino acid of GLP-1 with GLP-1R, histidine analogs such as 1-imidazolyl-alanine (1), have been synthesized via Michael addition to an acrylic acid ester. Enantiomeric resolution was achieved enzymatically. The results of binding and activity studies for the incorporation of 1 and other such analogs into GLP-1 will be reported.

"Studies have shown that peptide GLP-1 induces the production of insulin in the human body as it binds and activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), making it a promising method of treatment for diabetes mellitus.

Although the non peptide antagonist T-0632 (1) inhibits the release of insulin, the selective binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R makes T-0632 a potential lead compound for diabetes treatment. We have developed an ef\xef\xac\x81cient synthesis of racemic T-0632.

"The in\xef\xac\x82uence of the later philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein is profound and pervasive, and has penetrated most areas of philosophy, particularly the philosophy of language, and, more recently, the philosophy of religion.

"This study examined the relation between social aggression and menarche, the \xef\xac\x81rst period. Social aggression is a set of behaviors that harm others through damage to their self-esteem, friendships, or social status (Underwood, 2003). While both males and females have been found to engage in social aggression, research evidence suggests that females tend to be more socially aggressive, whereas males tend to be more physically aggressive. Moreover, the use of social aggression seems to increase as girls enter early adolescence. One possible explanation for the increase in social aggression among girls may be the onset of menarche, which can be a stressful and psychologically disruptive time for girls. No research to date has explored the relation between social aggression and menarche. In this study, the relation between social aggression and menarche was examined using a sample of sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade girls.'"

Images within the book, many of which were contributed by the Taller de Gr\xc3\xa1\xef\xac\x81ca Popular, a Mexican print workshop founded in 1937, denounce all aspects of Nazi ideology, including strong condemnations of anti-Semitism, and offer to the Spanish-speaking public a model for resistance and revolution.'"
"\xe2\x80\x9cMemories crowd in on one, as one sits down to write,\xe2\x80\x9d so begins W. Plumer Mills in a letter to his wife in January of 1938. It is Nanjing, China during the Japanese occupation; caught in this traumatic event, how do individuals react and remember through the act of writing? By using the unpublished letters of American missionary W. Plumer Mills to his family, I examine how he tried to make sense of the atrocities that were occurring around him, based on his previous experiences. Ultimately, such primary sources shed light on the documenters of history in the midst of a traumatic event, and how their attitudes and assumptions, as well as other factors, help to shape what they write and, consequently, what we remember today.

"Across the world, women are plagued by violence and harassment. Due to the sexist bias inherent in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s rigid Muslim society, women often suffer as silent victims of domestic abuse, and institutions to help these victims are only beginning to emerge.

"Since the collapse of the USSR, Russia has experienced a dramatic rise in poverty together with the shrinking of the welfare state. The economic transition placed particular groups of women in a lower income group than men and had the ancillary effect of weakening their political representation. Women\xe2\x80\x99s movements are only starting to develop in Russia. To gain a deeper understanding of the situation, the Russian case must be put in international comparative perspective. In addition to Russia, I examine how women have reacted to poverty and social exclusion in Brazil where women\xe2\x80\x99s organizations have successfully utilized the mechanisms offered by civil society and democracy to promote their beliefs and highlight issues. In comparing Russia and Brazil, I aim to evaluate what impact the voice of women has had on the lives of the poorest women, those with little access to income, power, and democratic representation.

"Previous studies have shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in vertebrate cardiac muscle are activated during periods of decreased oxygen availability through a nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic-GMP (cGMP) mediated pathway. The purpose of my study was to determine whether activation of this ion channel in the heart plays a protective role in a species highly tolerant of low oxygen environments, the gold\xef\xac\x81sh (Carassius auratus). A cellular model of environmental hypoxia was used to examine the effects of altered channel activity on isolated myocytes. Channel activation, via the presumed agonists diazoxide, SNAP, and 8-Br-cGMP, increased the survival rate of the cells under hypoxic conditions. In addition, patch-clamp experiments are currently being used to study the effects of these drugs on single channels in an effort to distinguish the cardioprotective effects of activating KATP channels at two different locations in the cell: the sarcolemma and the mitochondrial inner membrane.

"Persistent neural activity, a sustained level of neuronal response following the presentation of a transient stimulus, is thought to be the neural correlate of short-term memory. Most previous models assume that single cells are incapable of intrinsically maintaining persistence and require implausibly \xef\xac\x81ne-tuned positive feedback provided by a neural network. We propose that the \xef\xac\x81ne tuning is not necessary if a cell contains a bistable mechanism distributed across multiple individual dendritic compartments. I am using the program NEURON to construct a model cell capable of generating action potentials and receiving input through individual dendritic compartments. These compartments contain bistable properties mediated by ionic channels shown to underlie dendritic plateau potentials. Once these bistable properties have been established in individual dendrites, I will test whether coupling dendrites will allow the neuron to exhibit multiple levels of persistent neural activity.

"Hydrogels are polymer networks that undergo stimuli-responsive volume phase transitions, in which the gels contract and expel their contents into their surroundings.

The exhibition will document the design process and present drawings and three-dimensional models of the projects.'"
"As architecture majors here at Wellesley College, we lack a department home. Our objective for the Architecture 350 class offered in the fall semester of 2004 was to learn AutoCAD as a tool for architectural design and utilize it to design a proposal for an Architecture department for Wellesley College. After building up a foundation in AutoCAD, each student was given the third \xef\xac\x82oor plans for Pendleton, as prospective location for the department, and a list of speci\xef\xac\x81cations for what our architecture department was to have. From there, each person brought to the table her own unique design, working in two dimensional plans and sections.'"
"Woodwind music encountered new possibilities in the twentieth century. Whereas previous eras placed emphasis on realizing the musical potential of the stringed instruments, the twentieth century saw composers who not only tested the vast and previously unexplored capabilities of the woodwind family, but also the virtuosity of the musicians. Our presentation aims to impart the essential and also exceptional qualities of the woodwind instruments through performances of solo works and ensemble pieces.'"
"Over a century after the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy by a group of American businessmen, Native Hawaiians are rallying together in a move for cultural recognition and political sovereignty. Central to their discourse is the question of Hawaiian identity. My thesis examines the varied understandings of land and peoplehood that play into this notion of identity and consequently shape the move for Hawaiian sovereignty. I juxtapose the legal maneuverings of the political organization Ka Lahui Hawai\xe2\x80\x99i with the agricultural restoration of independent taro farmers. Both factions mobilize history to invoke very speci\xef\xac\x81c understandings of \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d identity relationships. While Ka Lahui centers its bid for sovereignty around a revisionist reading of political events and their role in the transformation of society, agriculturists worry less about contestation within an academic frame-work; instead their calls for sovereignty are based on metaphors of cultivation and fertility passed down from generation to generation.'"
"In 1745, many of the Narragansett Indians living on reservation lands in the Rhode Island colony adopted Christianity. Although this once powerful and in\xef\xac\x82uential population had been introduced decades earlier to Christian principles by visiting missionaries and colonists, it was not until a series of religious revivals that gripped the American colonies during the middle of the eighteenth century that the Narragansetts chose Christian conversion. The Great Awakening, as the revivals came to be known, challenged traditional forms of Protestant worship and church hierarchy, encouraging some members to create an alternate vision of their religious traditions within \xe2\x80\x9cseparate\xe2\x80\x9d congregations. Like many of their English neighbors, the Narragansetts were also affected by the Awakening\xe2\x80\x99s evangelical message of personal empowerment. In response, the Narragansetts were prompted to creatively interpret \xe2\x80\x9cNew Light\xe2\x80\x9d worship within their own religious framework, shaping a Christian identity that derived sacred power from a new source: The Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s God.

"Discrimination and marginalization are not themes unique to any particular culture, but in fact have been pervasive throughout history in all parts of the world. In Japan, Sumii Sue wrote about the struggles of a burakumin or \xe2\x80\x9coutcaste\xe2\x80\x9d family in her novel The River with No Bridge (1957) reacting to the unfair treatment she had witnessed towards this group. Meanwhile in Mexico, Rosario Castellanos presented the interracial tensions between the Maya Indian minority and the white landowners of Chiapas through her novel, The Nine Guardians (1961). Although the novels come from different literary traditions, both writers were committed to presenting the struggles of both minorities to promote social change. The ethical representations of these minorities are evident within common themes such as the struggle for education, the unity of family and the strong ties to nature.

"The message of most world religions is one of compassion, understanding, and forgiveness but, paradoxically, psychologists have found a robust connection between religiousness and authoritarianism, prejudice, and intolerance. We used a sample of older age, mostly White and Mainline Protestants to investigate the relation between religiousness (traditional or institutionalized religious belief) and spirituality (nontraditional or noninstitutionalized religious belief) and authoritarianism or submission to authority, conventionalism, and hostility toward minority groups. In late adulthood, religiousness was related positively and spirituality was related negatively to authoritarianism. These relations were present even after controlling for religious fundamentalism, social class, intelligence, gender, age cohort, and personality characteristics. Religiousness and spirituality in early adulthood predicted authoritarianism in late adulthood, a time interval of close to 40 years.

"The digital revolution of the past twenty years has fundamentally changed the way we analyze and store information. Wavelets are a powerful mathematical tool that has transformed the way we process, compress, and analyze digital signals and images. Wavelets allow us to decompose a signal or image into simpler components that can then be used by mathematicians, scientists, or engineers to alter the original data. A unique feature of wavelet analysis is the wide variety of different wavelets that can be applied to different types of problems. Everyone from the FBI to the telephone company use wavelets in a wide array of applications. We will describe some of the basic concepts behind wavelet analysis and demonstrate some of what wavelets can do in image analysis.'"
"Gels containing silica are widely used in industry in paints, inks, and tooth pastes. However, the physical properties of these gels are not fully understood. In the research I have conducted this year for the physics department, we focused our attention on the electrical properties of particular gels. The gels we used were obtained from suspending silica particles in silicone oil. After only a couple of weeks, the suspensions exhibited an unexpected behavior, turning from gels into \xef\xac\x82uids. The explanation for the ageing of the gels rests on the formation of hydro-gen-bonds between the silanol groups present on the silica particles and the silicone oil. Our goal was to measure the electrical properties of these systems, more speci\xef\xac\x81cally the conductivity and dielectric constant. As the samples age, we recorded the electric characteristics and used them to explain the behavior of the suspensions. I shall present our results, the correlations between the electrical and viscoelastic properties of the samples, and our hypothesis for the reasons behind the ageing behavior.'"
"The Wellesley-MIT cross-registration program allows students to take advantage of unique resources at each school. One such resource at MIT is the Nuclear Reactor Lab, where students and faculty from several departments, as well as from local hospitals and radiological centers, conduct research. I visited the facility in my sophomore year and discovered that undergraduates are given the responsibility of operating the reactor, which seemed both alarming and thrilling. And so began the year-long training process of becoming a Reactor Operator. Judging by the fact that I had to take a licensing exam with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and that the job involves nuclear safety in both normal and emergency conditions, I found that the responsibilities of this campus job are a little different from the others that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had, be it washing dishes in the Davis cafeteria or tutoring physics.

"Cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, are the only prokaryotic organisms that carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. They appear to be highly adaptable because they exist in environments with high temperatures or high salt concentrations. However they are not found in many acidic conditions because they grow best at alkaline pH. This study focuses on whether cyanobacteria can build up an acid tolerance response in order to survive in an acidic environment. The organisms were pre-exposed to mildly acidic media buffered at pH 6.3 and provided with 5% carbon dioxide and air. After the initial adaptation period, the cells were then transferred into media buffered at pH 5.5. The results showed that cyanobacteria were able to grow at the mildly acidic environment, but did not exhibit an acid tolerance response when placed into a lower pH because there was no growth. The trials were performed using different cell densities, but the pattern of growth was the same for each density.

"Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 has been shown to grow optimally at phH 7.5-10. However, little research has been performed on the effect of acid stress on any cyanobacterium. My goal was to characterize the acid stress response of strain 6803 cells, the \xef\xac\x81rst cyanobacterium to have its DNA sequenced. Growth and viability studies showed that cells grown in medium buffered at pH 5.2 stopped growing and lost viability. To identify the acid stress proteins of strain 6803, cells were incubated in medium buffered at different acidic pHs and then broken. Proteins were then separated by 2-D gel electrophoresis and trypsin digested to be identi\xef\xac\x81ed by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Protein analyses showed that 8 to 30% of the total cell proteins were upregulated or downregulated, 19 to 23% disappeared and 23 to 30% were newly induced upon acid stress.

"Cyanobacteria are found in a wide variety of habitats due to their ability to survive in extreme and stressful conditions. The research in this laboratory on bacterial biochemistry and physiology aims to understand the relationship between environmental changes and stress on the structure and function of cyanobacteria. Our research investigates the effects of different nitrogen sources and nitrogen starvation on the enzyme, nitrate reductase, in a strain of nonnitrogen-\xef\xac\x81xing cyanobacteria. The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of nitrate to nitrite, an integral step in nitrate assimilation. This research explores nitrogen control in cyanobacteria, a common phenomenon among microorganisms, through which the assimilatory pathways of some nitrogen sources is repressed when a more easily assimilated nitrogen source is available.

"Cyanobacteria are ancient, prokaryotic organisms that have adapted to their environment for three billion years. Cyanophycin and phycocyanobilin are nitrogen storage molecules within cyanobacteria. Both storage molecules are depleted during nitrogen starvation. When cells are starved for, and then re-fed nitrogen, cyanophycin reappears within minutes, while phycocyanobilin re-synthesis takes 1-2 days. We, therefore, hypothesize that nitrogen cycles through cyanophycin into phycocyanobilin. Because the protons interact with 14N and 15N differently in the presence of a strong magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld due to their different nuclear spins, 1H-NMR spectroscopy can be used to decipher whether nitrogen from the medium (15N) or from breakdown of intracellular proteins (14N) is incorporated into cyanophycin and phycocyanin. It was found that the ratio of 14N to 15N decreased in cyanophycin over time. All new phycocyanobilins were completely made up of 15N.

"How do cyanobacteria survive in lakes and ponds made increasingly acid by air pollution? Some studies have shown that one of the acid stress coping mechanisms of microorganisms is to maintain a neutral or slightly alkaline internal pH, also known as pH homeostasis. Moreover, studies on E. coli have suggested that the use of a sodium/proton antiporter, a protein embedded in the cell membrane that carries one substance in one direction (into the cell) and a second substance in the opposite direction (out of the cell), is involved in maintaining pH homeostasis under alkaline conditions. Do cyanobacteria share a similar coping mechanism under stress? By using 31P NMR and 23Na spectroscopy, I am investigating whether a cyanobacterial strain, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, maintains pH homeostasis and employs a Na+/H+ antiporter as a part of the homeostasis system under acid stress.

"Cyanobacteria are aquatic and photosynthetic microorganisms which are often unicellular, though they may grow in colonies large enough to be seen. Most cyanobacteria contain nitrogen storage molecules to guard against nitrogen starvation. In some strains of cyanobacteria, the main nitrogen storage polymer is multi-L-arginine-poly (L-aspartic acid), or cyanophycin granule polypeptide (CGP). Cyanobacteria also contain a second nitrogen storage molecule known as phycocyanin. Studying the relationship between these two types of nitrogen storage molecules under conditions of nutrient stress illustrates the adaptation of cyanobacteria to a range of environmental conditions in which the levels of nitrogen available to them vary widely. Using cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6308, we compared the uptake of two different nitrogen isotopes in cyanophycin during nitrogen starvation and after refeeding. With the use of 1H NMR and UV-Visible Spectroscopy, we observed a correlation between an increase in the amount of phycocyanin and the presence of both 14N and 15N in the cyanophycin.

We are looking speci\xef\xac\x81cally for amino acid decarboxylases, which would break down certain amino acids in the external environment to a more basic form. It was found that cyanobacteria cells are able to grow well in amino acid supplemented media.

"Located downstream from Henry Wood\xe2\x80\x99s Sons paint factory, sediments from Lake Waban have the potential to record the industrial history of the watershed.

To unravel the industrial history, we analyzed sediment freeze cores from the deepest portion of the lake and used the data collected to identify geochemically unique stratigraphic horizons. We also investigated current sedimentation processes through surface dredging and sediment coring at the inlet and outlet of the lake. Chemical analyses of sediments were conducted using x-ray \xef\xac\x82uorescence. Preliminary analyses show elevated lead and chromium levels in surface sediment and a geochemical stratigraphy that correlates with industrial activity on the watershed.'"
"The World Trade Center (WTC) collapse in New York City on September 11, 2001 released a considerable amount of dust and debris into New York Harbor (NYH).

Bulk elemental compositions were obtained using polarized energy-dispersive X-ray \xef\xac\x82uorescence (EDXRF) and depth pro\xef\xac\x81les were compared with cores known to contain the original WTC \xef\xac\x81ngerprint material. Though depth pro\xef\xac\x81le correlations exist between the two cores, the WTC \xef\xac\x81ngerprint does not appear to be preserved. These results indicate short-term episodic mixing and particle resuspension, followed by rapid sedimentation totaling 22.5 cm in one year. Further analysis can characterize sediment transport processes and current inputs into NYH.'"

"MEMRI is a technique that uses the natural properties of manganese ions to enhance images of the nervous system.

Our project takes two approaches. Firstly, the use of manganese, and its application, is being re\xef\xac\x81ned to the point where the resulting images could approach the resolution shown in histological studies, enabling longitudinal studies where the cray\xef\xac\x81sh is unharmed by the low dosages of manganese used.

"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes a range of debilitating symptoms in females and still-birth or early death in males. Over 75% of RTT cases are due to mutations in the X chromosome-linked gene that encodes the transcription repressor protein, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Compared to healthy brains, RTT brains appear to have a 30% volume reduction, however, this decrease is not uniform throughout the brain. One region showing a marked volume reduction is the striatum, a structure involved in motor control. This study quanti\xef\xac\x81es volumes of MeCP2-null mice compared to their wild-type littermates. AMIRA software will be used to trace manually the striatum and calculate striatal volumes. Changes in striatum volume may help to explain the degeneration of purposeful movement observed in the MeCP2-null mice and in RTT patients.

"Mutations in the X-linked gene encoding MeCP2 are responsible for over 75% of all cases of Rett Syndrome (RTT): a neurodevelopmental disorder debilitating 1 in 10,000-22,000 females. RTT individuals display moderate to severe mental retardation and neuropathological evidence indicates abnormal development of the cholinergic neurotransmitter system. In normal individuals, choline supplementation during development alters the cholinergic system and facilitates improvements in adult memory. We hypothesize that choline supplementation of MeCP2 mutant mice, an animal model of RTT, will improve cognitive de\xef\xac\x81cits. MeCP2 mutant and wildtype mice were supplemented with either 25 mM choline / 50 mM saccharin (test) or 50 mM saccharin alone (control) from embryonic day (ED) 10 to weaning (3 weeks).

"Previous studies have shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in vertebrate cardiac muscle are activated during periods of decreased oxygen availability through a nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic-GMP (cGMP) mediated pathway.

A cellular model of environmental hypoxia was used to examine the effects of altered channel activity on isolated myocytes.

"The class of Experimental 240, \xe2\x80\x9cPapyrus to Print to Pixel,\xe2\x80\x9d spent the fall semester taking a unique look at the history of written communication. Starting with Babylonian clay tablets and moving through papyrus scrolls, codices, medieval manuscripts, early printing methods, mechanical printing, and the digital present, the class examined the evolution of these different technologies and the many connections between them. The class received a truly multifaceted, hands-on education through a combination of working with the original material culture, group discussions, re-creating the original processes and products in a lab setting, and learning from numerous expert lecturers. Our interactive presentation will share with the Wellesley community the exciting experience that we have had, and we hope that others will gain from it as well.'"
"Fifth-century Greek sophist Gorgias describes the ideal man as one who \xe2\x80\x9chelps one\xe2\x80\x99s friends and harms one\xe2\x80\x99s enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d This model of heroism, which is found in Greek myth and tragedy, is dangerous because it \xef\xac\x81rmly de\xef\xac\x81nes people either as friend or as enemy. The enemy is regarded as a dehumanized Other against whom one is not expected to show restraint. Similar \xe2\x80\x9cus vs. them\xe2\x80\x9d tensions have taken different forms in America, and African American writers have turned to both historical and literary tragedies of the past to re\xef\xac\x82ect upon today\xe2\x80\x99s realities. Toni Morrison\xe2\x80\x99s Beloved and Rita Dove\xe2\x80\x99s Darker Face of the Earth use the Greek stories of Oedipus and Medea as a demonstration of the cyclic nature of dehumanization and a warning against \xef\xac\x81ghting evil with evil. These works suggest that Greek literature and mythology still deserve to play a signi\xef\xac\x81cant role in America today.'"

"In Book XII of the Metaphysics, Aristotle presents his theory of origins, providing a careful description regarding motion and its initiation by the Prime Mover. One of the most striking things about this section is its possible compatibility with a Christian idea of God. This did not escape the attention of the Christian thinker St. Thomas Aquinas, who took an interest in Aristotle and wrote a number of commentaries on his works, including one on the Metaphysics. In reading this commentary it is evident that Aquinas\xe2\x80\x99 cautious inter-pretation of Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s text resulted in his belief that Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s account was compatible with aspects of Christianity. Aquinas attempts an unbiased and neutral look at Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s discussion, and it is evident that his interpretations of this text lead to the reconciliation of perceived con\xef\xac\x82icts between the existing forms of Christianity and Aristotelian teleology.'"
"This panel explores the ways in which the literature of the late eighteenth century both re\xef\xac\x82ected and shaped its social and political contexts. Some novels show us how women\xe2\x80\x99s behavior was supposed to be governed by the ideal of modesty. At the same time, however, women played an important role in the public culture of the time, modeling \xe2\x80\x9cpolite conversation\xe2\x80\x9d and participating in collaborative writing, philanthropic projects, and publishing ventures. The Bluestocking society, for example, included numerous women intellectuals, and well-known writers such as Frances Burney. Even the Gothic novel, which was widely regarded to be a \xe2\x80\x9cfeminine\xe2\x80\x9d genre, shows a complex nature. On the one hand, it re\xef\xac\x82ects the rationalism and scienti\xef\xac\x81c curiosity of the period.

"The creation of Al-Jazeera in 1996 revolutionized the satellite media in the Arab world. Approximately 35 million people worldwide regularly watch it.

"Amid the predictions and prescriptions for regime change or reform in the Democratic People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of Korea (DPRK), studies on North Korea fail to consider the prospects for corruption in reforming the communist state.

"The Pink-Plumed Poppy (Macleaya cordata) is an invasive weed that quickly dominates unsuspecting gardens with its imposing six-foot tall, leggy presence. However, despite its reputation as a gardener\xe2\x80\x99s worst nightmare, the plant remains an intriguing oddity, due to its unusual ability to completely shed water (much like the most expensive of raincoats). While previous studies have determined that the hydrophobicity of many plants is a physical property of surface roughness, as well as microscopic waxy crystals on the surface of the leaves, there is evidence that suggests that the chemical constituents of a plant may affect the physical integrity of its surface. This presentation will discuss how one determines the chemical constituents in a plant, as well as the different characteristics that make something waterproof.

"Island archipelagos provide excellent model systems within which to study evolving populations and the processes that in\xef\xac\x82uence their evolution. Isolation from the mainland provides opportunity for reduced gene exchange promoting differentiation and potential formation of new species.

Patterns of population differentiation were compared between endemic weevils from one of the youngest islands (Floreana) and from the oldest island of the archipelago (San Crist\xc3\xb3bal). DNA sequences for several rapidly evolving mitochondrial gene regions were used to produce phylogenetic trees for all populations and species.

"Study of habitat selection has a long history in avian ecology, and much of what we \xe2\x80\x9cknow\xe2\x80\x9d may be wrong. The purpose of this project was to test the hypothesis that birds select neighborhoods of conspeci\xef\xac\x81cs in which to breed rather than as has been traditionally thought by assessing habitat features. As a \xef\xac\x81rst step in testing this hypothesis, we determined whether Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) used public information \xe2\x80\x93 conspeci\xef\xac\x81c song \xe2\x80\x93 to select breeding territories. We predicted that bluebirds would settle and nest at higher density where playback of conspeci\xef\xac\x81c song was provided. To test this prediction, we provided song during the period of territory settlement to one of two sets of three boxes placed in each of six replicate meadows. Results of this ongoing study will contribute to basic understanding of avian habitat selection and will add to the tools needed for songbird conservation.

"\xe2\x80\x9cArgentina\xe2\x80\x9d and other Rockhopper and African penguins at the New England Aquarium communicate using bray and contact calls. Penguins and many species that breed in large colonies use sound as a means of recognizing individuals and conspeci\xef\xac\x81cs. Are different call characteristics used in discrimination at the individual, sub-species, or species level? Over a period of three months I recorded contact and bray calls of 65 individuals from three species of penguins at the New England Aquarium. Calls were displayed as sonograms and a variety of sound variables were measured. Using discriminant analysis, I showed that main frequency and the average length of the syllable were most important in distinguishing among species, but that syllable amplitude and frequency patterns appear to be necessary to discriminate among individuals. The ability of species level cues to discriminate between sub-species of Rockhoppers supports their separation at the species level. (Research supported by Howard Hughes Medical Institute.)'"
"Plants sense their surrounding light environment and adapt to changes in light quality, quantity, and direction. For example, plants can move their chloroplasts into or out of the light in order to maximize their photosynthetic behavior.

We will present data showing how chloroplast number and size in\xef\xac\x82uence the ability of chloroplasts to move in response to changes in light intensity, and how that in turn impacts the photosynthetic behavior of leaves. We will present results of a proteomic approach that hopes to yield information about the downstream members of the signaling cascade of the photoreceptors phot1 and phot2. Finally, we will show evidence that blue light does not only trigger chloroplast movement but also impacts mitochondrial shape and movement.

"Over the past thirty years, the United Nations has generated novel institutions aimed at spawning intergovernmental and international cooperation to creatively solve environmental problems of great consequence to the world.

"It is said that the study of international relations revolves around power. When dealing with an environmental problem, states often have equal power to either solve the problem or worsen it. This power relationship changes when the problem centers on a transboundary river. An upstream state has greater power to worsen the problem and less interest in solving the problem. In such an asymmetrical relationship, what form do international agreements take and how are obligations distributed amongst states? This project examines the international treaties written about the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest rivers and \xef\xac\x81nds that, despite asymmetrical power, the norm of equality is still surprisingly strong. Given the strength of this norm, it also analyzes what factors cause treaties to deviate from distributing obligations equally and assume a more unequal form.'"
"The issues that surround the development of antibiotic resistance are often best addressed at the level of individuals and institutions, for reasons both biological and political. Although there are many who call for international policies to aid in preventing the development of resistance, few of these policies could be effectively enacted above the local level. It can be argued, however, that antibiotic resistance is a global issue, and that there are aspects of resistance for which an international-level approach may prove useful. In particular, agricultural antibiotic use and the distribution of antibiotics without a prescription are signi\xef\xac\x81cant contributors to resistance development that may be controlled through international instruments. The possibility of using international pharmaceutical regulation as a means of combating resistance is examined, as well as the likely political obstacles to this method of prevention and the biological issues that must be considered.'"

"Why was the Ruhlman Conference such a success? A student on the first program committee for the conference provided insight into that question when she suggested that \xe2\x80\x9cWellesley was a very academic place, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as intellectual as it might be.\xe2\x80\x9d By that I believe she meant that Wellesley students set high academic standards for themselves and their peers, that they worked hard to achieve those standards \xe2\x80\x93 but that they spent more time talking about how hard they work than about what they are working on. Although the Ruhlman Conference provided a venue to applaud and celebrate the hard work necessary to produce excellent projects, its focus was on the results of that hard work \xe2\x80\x93 the knowledge, understanding and joy that comes through serious intellectual engagement. If asked to describe how the conference has changed over time, most would probably say that the presentations have gotten better (more polished and professional) and that the audience has grown larger and more diverse (students, faculty and staff being joined by a growing number of family members, friends and alumnae). These changes aside, many qualities of the Ruhlman Conference have remained constant: the opportunity for students to present their work (often for the first time) to a large and varied audience, the justifiable pride students feel in demonstrating their depth of knowledge of a particular subject, the inspiration these presentations serve for students new to the college, and the occasion for all members of the Wellesley community to observe the immense range of intellectual work being done across the campus. Ten years later, it is not difficult to see why the Ruhlman Conference has become such a valued Wellesley tradition. Lee Cuba is William R.

Israel has been the center of political unrest for nearly a century. With no foreseeable end to the ongoing violence, piecing together the causes of discord is essential. One way to study the Arab-Israeli conflict is through Israel\xe2\x80\x99s literary canon. Observing how authors crafted Arab characters and their visions for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s future allows one to enter the minds of Israelis and view the Arab-Israeli conflict through their eyes.

"The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone released when there are high levels of glucose in the body. GLP-1 induces the production and release of insulin when bound to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). The non-peptide antagonist of the GLP-1R, T-0632 (1), inhibits the activation of GLP-1R by GLP-1. The binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R includes amino acid residues involved in the activation of the receptor. Utilizing the selectivity of T-0632 binding to the GLP-1R and known parameters for receptor activation, structural modifications can be made to T-0632 to form agonists of GLP-1R, thus creating a series of potential lead drug compounds for diabetes treatment. T-0632 can be efficiently synthesized in nine steps. This synthesis and the preparation of the active variations of T-0632 will be discussed. Binding profiles and c-AMP induction activities of the T-0632 analogs will be presented. (Research supported by the Roberta and Karl Staley Fund.)'"

"The small peptide hormone insulin is an important part of human metabolism. Patients who lack the ability to produce sufficient functional insulin suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus. A better understanding of the pathway that produces this vital molecule can lead to new treatments for the disease.

One part of GLP-1 acts by binding to GLP-1R, while a second part of GLP-1 serves to activate GLP-1R to eventually lead to insulin production.

"Binding studies of peptide ligands to receptors are often done by competition with radioactive forms of natural ligands. These natural ligands often have very high binding constants, and, as such, overwhelm the binding of the test peptides, even though it can be demonstrated that these test peptides result in activation of the receptor.

"Beautiful, sensuously tactile, witty, and employing materials as diverse as copper pipes, latex, soap, and organza, the signify cant work of the late American artist Rachel bas-Cohain engaged the political and art historical contexts that informed its production. In the early 1970s, bas- Cohain joined a growing number of feminist artists determined to subvert the masculinism of the white, male art establishment. Through their activism and artistic production these women effected profound change, creating new exhibition opportunities for themselves and other under-represented artists while undermining exclusionary modernist art criticism. Art historically neglected, the body of bas-Cohain\xe2\x80\x99s conceptual work remains outside the dominant paradigm of feminist art, which often reclaimed materials, processes, and subject matter coded and debased as \xe2\x80\x9cfeminine.\xe2\x80\x9d This presentation will consider the subversive, socially engaged feminist production of Rachel bas-Cohain, whose promising career was abruptly ended by her premature death.

"The glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (A), once considered the antibiotic of last resort, has seen the development of many strains of resistant bacteria over the past twenty years. Several attempts to overcome this resistance have focused on functionalizing the amino group of a peripheral carbohydrate component of vancomycin, known as the vancosamine sugar. Here, we present recent progress towards the development of an entirely new derivative of vancomycin that incorporates a septanose residue at the vancosamine position (B). The septanose residue is the result of a formal one carbon homologation of the natural vancosamine sugar. Vancomycin derivative B shows promise as a potential analog that can be used combat vancomycin resistant strains of bacteria. (Research supported by a Wellesley College Faculty Award.)'"
"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with mental retardation in females. It is characterized by normal development from birth to six months, when motor and cognitive skills plateau and eventually decline. RTT is due to mutations in the X-linked gene that encodes a transcriptional repressor protein. Brain volumes in RTT are 30% smaller than normal. These data and behavioral research led us to hypothesize that in RTT there are selective decreases in brain regions involved in cognitive and motor skills. We tested this hypothesis in brains of a mouse model of RTT. Indeed, we found decreases in whole brain volume, as well as in regions associated with motor (the striatum), memory (the hippocampus), and anxiety (the amygdala) functions. These studies provide insights into the relationship between brain structure and function in this developmental disorder, as well as in normal humans.

"The crystal structure of the mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) from E. coli represents a unique channel structure with intriguing heptameric symmetry and significant soluble domains. There are several families of membrane proteins related to MscS channels, including a recently identified family of ion channels, the bCNG channels, putatively gated by cyclic nucleotides. In this study, we performed pair-wise multiple sequence alignments to evaluate sequence conservation within the bCNG family. Using the MODELLER program, we have produced homology models of the cyclic nucleotide binding domains of the channels and verified them using a variety of protein structure verification methods. We have begun to refine these models using molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations can also give us insight into the role these domains play in channel function. Overall, these models will play a critical role in developing experiments to characterize the structure-function relationships of these channels.

"Cationic antimicrobial peptides are important players in the innate immune response of organisms from bacteria to insects to humans. These peptides are active against a broad range of microorganisms, exhibit fast response times to infection, and rarely select for resistant bacterial strains. Over 500 such peptides have been isolated and fall into four structural groups. Buforin II is a 21-amino acid peptide belonging to the amphipathic, \xce\xb1-helical group, which includes the well-characterized peptide magainin 2. Currently, it is believed that buforin exhibits its antimicrobial activity by translocating across cell membranes and binding to DNA, thereby interfering with intracellular processes and leading to cell death. In order to further understand buforin\xe2\x80\x99s mechanism of action, we are developing vesicle assays to study the chemical properties necessary for translocation of buforin and its analogues across lipid bilayers.

In the ever growing battle of mankind versus disease comes an ancient solution that may tip the scale for future generations: antimicrobial peptides. Antimicrobial peptides are instrumental in many plant and animal systems for the prevention of diseases as bacteria and viruses generally have not developed immunity to these special proteins.

"The long-term impact and transport of oil spills in the coastal marine environment is only beginning to be quantitatively understood. Recent studies are examining the transport and fate of spill-derived petroleum hydrocarbons after they undergo sedimentation. Initial findings suggest long residence times for pollutants in the sedimentological record. With growing knowledge of the long-term behavior of petroleum in the marine environment, it is now possible to take the next step in understanding the dynamics of spill hydrocarbon/sediment interactions by systematically examining the relationship between sediment type and long-term total petroleum hydrocarbon sedimentation. Chemical, mineralogical, density, and redox conditions of the sediments will be analyzed, with particular attention paid to clay mineralogy. The information gleaned from this study will have important implications for understanding the fate of spill petroleum in this type of environment, potentially providing a means of biogeochemically fingerprinting historic spills as well as contributing towards a predictive model of long-term fate of oil spills in the sediment record.'"
"Heavy metals, such as lead, arsenic, and zinc, are dangerous not only to human life but also to wetland environments. The production of dry paint pigments near Lake Waban led to dangerously high concentrations of heavy metals that warranted remediation in 2003.

Different species of wetland plants from sites at the inflow and the outflow were tested using 109Cadmium Niton technology. Samples taken from the outflow showed higher levels of lead and arsenic than those from the inflow, indicating that the remediation probably occurred too late to fully contain the movement of these heavy metals.'"

"In the last five years, Russian enterprise performance has improved hand-inhand with the growing economy, but the question as to what has driven this performance remains an open one. Is the improved performance of enterprises during the oil boom a result of good policies in the form of economic reforms, or just a result of good luck in the form of high oil prices? Using an enterprise survey conducted by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, I analyze whether economic policies have had a significant impact on performance of Russian companies during the current oil boom. Understanding whether the improved economic performance is a result of good policy or of good luck is important for determining whether the Russian economy is diverse and robust enough to sustain its current positive growth trends.

This gives an experimental signature of the presence of BEC atoms in the system, which distinguishes them from atoms in the uncondensed phase. We also compared the patterns from condensed atoms with varying levels of interatomic interactions.

Because Rossetti was both a painter and a poet, looking at some of his better known works will show how his \xe2\x80\x9cpainter\xe2\x80\x99s eye\xe2\x80\x9d influences his poetry and, in turn, Vaughan Williams\xe2\x80\x99s musical settings. I will play excerpts of the songs both from a recording and on the keyboard to demonstrate the relationship between words and music in greater depth.'"
"In The Woman Who Walked into Doors, Irish novelist Roddy Doyle assumes the voice of Paula Spencer, a woman strikingly different from himself. Paula is a woman, a widow, a mother, and an alcoholic. She cleans houses for a living and struggles to keep her family afloat. She is also the victim of prolonged domestic abuse, in her words, \xe2\x80\x9cseventeen years of being hit and kicked.\xe2\x80\x9d Doyle writes from Paula\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, creating an arresting and convincing voice for this woman who differs so greatly from himself. But what right does he have to do this? Is Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s choice to speak for Paula damaging to similarly disadvantaged women? Or would it be morally wrong for Doyle not to address these vital issues that his society has been trying to ignore? The Same Subject Diverted: The Derationalization of William Hazlitt Erica I. dela Cruz \xe2\x80\x9906, English'"
"At the height of his career, William Hazlitt was the most renowned and controversial periodical critic of the Romantic era. Yet John Keats, a distant admirer, once observed: \xe2\x80\x9cI know he thinks himself not estimated by ten people in the world. I wish he knew he is.\xe2\x80\x9d A bold and uncompromising social commentator, Hazlitt made powerful enemies of many of his contemporaries \xe2\x80\x93 most famously the poetic giants Wordsworth and Coleridge- -for voicing his grave disappointment at their abandonment of their radical roots. Underlying the prolific essayist\xe2\x80\x99s stinging criticisms was a yearning for acceptance and lasting fame which often strongly opposed his devotion to integrity and the search for truth. My thesis explores the ways in which Hazlitt expresses his attempt to reconcile a desperate need to find ""a heart to speak to\xe2\x80\x9d while maintaining his most cherished principle: that of being true to oneself.

Stoppard\xe2\x80\x99s in-depth look at two characters on the fringes of Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s masterpiece poses questions about identity, fate, and the nature of life and death onstage. We plunge into the endless layers of this play-within- a-play and emerge laughing in spite of the dark issues Rosencrantz and Guildenstern explores. Stoppard does it again with his 1975 Travesties, a play that incorporates James Joyce, Lenin, and Dadaist Tristan Tzara into Wilde\xe2\x80\x99s The Importance of Being Earnest. With his mind-boggling structure and reliance on history and well-known literature, Stoppard has a style all his own that nonetheless exemplifies modern British drama. My presentation will compare Rosencrantz and Guildenstern with Hamlet and Travesties with The Importance of Being Earnest to delve into themes of identity and fatalism, and to answer some of the key questions Stoppard poses about both.

"Drawn from my experiences living in India and Brazil, this collection of original poems explores rituals and spirituality as they shape responses to mortality and the treatment of death in two different cultures. The cities of the title represent real places, but they are also metaphoric locations where the contrasting and interlocking landscapes of life and death are formed. Looking at rural and urban settings, private family spheres and public street scenes, this collection portrays the detailed nuances of family life, culture, tradition, and social upheaval, questioning how we view our own mortality and why. \xe2\x80\x9cGrandma\xe2\x80\x9d: A Short Story Lauren Holmes \xe2\x80\x9907, English'"

"Islam is understood by its followers to be a religion of faith and equality. According to the Quran, all Muslims are equal and connected to each other as part of the Ummah (world body of Muslims). In light of this concept, one would expect to see close interaction among Muslim immigrants in Europe. To test this assumption, I have studied the immigrant Muslim community in Lleida, Spain. The Muslims there are divided along cultural and ethnic lines: North African (Arab/Berber) and Sub-Saharan African (black). My study analyzes why the Muslims in Lleida are living and worshipping in communities divided along cultural-ethnic lines. I have found that different cultural backgrounds, conflicting/dissimilar approaches to theology, and the Spanish community\xe2\x80\x99s social perceptions of these groups foster the lack of unity between them despite their common faith.

Inequality in Access: How Does Accessibility to Course Work Affect Standardized Testing among Minority Youth? Shayla Adams \xe2\x80\x9908, Spanish and Urban Studies'"
"Standardized tests have long since been a means of testing students\xe2\x80\x99 ability to master material against pre-established norms. Since the Brown v. Board of Education decision, educational researchers have focused on examining why minorities continually score lower than their white counterparts on these tests. Access to academic course work is important because it affects student outcomes on assessments. For students who desire to attend college, access to Advanced Placement (AP) courses is crucial to their admission. Using national data, this presentation will show findings from my examination about how high schools students are distributed in AP courses in regard to race. I focus on how the location and academic environment of the school relates to student access to these courses. I will also present the relationship between access to AP courses and student achievement by comparing samples of high students using data from national longitudinal surveys and a Wellesley College first-year student survey.

"Anthropology This study examines perceptions of infertility in communities of urban Dakar and rural K\xc3\xa9dougou of Senegal. Twenty-five men and women were involved in the study and discussed with me questions regarding infertility perspectives and treatment strategies. Informants in Dakar believe women are responsible for the incidence of infertility and they indicate divorce as a social consequence of the illness. Informants in K\xc3\xa9dougou believe either a man or a woman is responsible and they perceive infertile individuals as normal members of society.

"The Other, defined through the notions of race, gender, and language, can be seen as someone distinct from either the individual or the collective Self.

"This presentation will focus on trends and issues facing women in California state politics today. Women in the California State Assembly have a unique relationship with male politicians in the state, epitomized by their rocky relationship with Governor Arnold \xe2\x80\x9cGirlie-Men\xe2\x80\x9d Schwarzenegger. Focusing closely on the Assemblywoman who represents Oakland, CA (Wilma Chan, D-16), I will discuss what legislative issues the Assemblywomen deal with most often. I will also discuss strategies that women in the Assembly must take to assure passage of their bills, as well as the interactions between male and female leaders in the legislature. Looking to the future, I will also examine whether term limits affect the number of women serving in the Assembly, and whether women will ever reach full parity in the legislature? Social Progress or Self-promotion: Analyzing the Influence of Antoinette Fouque on the French Women\xe2\x80\x99s Liberation Movement Danielle Friedland \xe2\x80\x9906, French'"
"What happens to a social cause when a fringe element suddenly claims to speak for the entire movement? The French Women\xe2\x80\x99s Liberation Movement (MLF) was forced to consider this issue in the 1970s, when Antoinette Fouque (a former psychoanalyst) and her anti-feminist followers (mostly ex-patients) took advantage of tensions among the various factions of the MLF to overemphasize their involvement in a cause with which they largely disagreed. This presentation will follow the movement through the tumultuous 1970s and examine the causes and effects of the shift from an anti-establishment movement to a movement whose self-declared mouthpiece not only complied with the system, but profited from it as well.

"Activated-Induced Manganese Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (AIM-MRI) is a technique that is used for functional MRI studies to measure activity in the nervous system. Manganese (II) is taken up preferentially by the nervous system because, like calcium (II), it is capable of selectively entering active neurons. Manganese (II) also enhances the contrast within MR images. AIM-MRI was applied to the crayfish visual and olfactory systems. Intermolt Procambarus clarkii were imaged multiple times after a MnCl2- saline intramuscular injection. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that signal intensities in the MR images plateau 40 minutes after injection, indicating that manganese accumulation within tissues was complete. Signal intensities within the accessory, olfactory, and antennary lobes in the brain in MR images were compared with and without a light or olfactory stimulus for any indication of preferential uptake by tissue due to the stimulus. This study provides the basic methods for future circadian rhythm and sensory experiments. (Research supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Robert and Karl Staley Fund.)

"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used to study neurologic diseases by providing quantitative information about concentrations of neurochemicals in the brain. We are using this technique to study Rett Syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects young girls. By analyzing the ratios of neurochemicals in a mouse model of RTT we hope to develop a more complete understanding of the nature of this disorder. The goal of this research is to analyze the effects of choline supplementation on brain chemistry to determine if choline can be a possible treatment for RTT. Lactating mice were given choline in their drinking water; nursing pups thus received choline through their mother\xe2\x80\x99s milk. These young mice were studied using ex vivo NMR spectroscopy to determine the effect of choline on their developing brains. Choline significantly increases the abnormally low concentration of N-acetylaspartate, an indicator of neuronal health, in RTT male mouse brains.

"The noninvasive nature of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with its powerful high-resolution images account for its popularity as a clinical diagnostic tool. Recent efforts to improve MRI focus on enhancing images using chemical contrast agents. A new class of contrast agents has emerged, showing immense potential for expanding the usefulness of MRI. The synthesis and characterization of one such agent TryGad, is the goal of this project. TryGad has been designed to enhance images in the presence of tryptophan-5-hydroxylase (TPH), a regulatory enzyme in the synthesis of serotonin. The differential activation of TryGad will provide insight into serotonin production. The synthesis of this agent is monitored through a variety of techniques ranging from proton NMR to electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI).

However, the perceptions of the female\xe2\x80\x99s social skills tended to be opposite to the males, which contradicted results found when studying the \xe2\x80\x9cradiation\xe2\x80\x9d of female characteristics to her male companion.'"
"When the air pollutants sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide combine with atmospheric moisture, they reenter the earth as acid deposition. This project examined the problem of acid deposition in the United States, and particularly focused on its impacts in the Adirondack region of New York. PH data from research conducted by the Adirondack Lakes Survey Corporation was compared with pH data that was measured in October, 2005 after a heavy rainstorm. The results show an example of episodic acidification and suggest that ecological damage will continue to occur until this process is mitigated and the acid neutralizing capacity of watersheds is restored.

"Neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, has been found in a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Neurogenesis in the brains of lobsters (Homarus americanus) and crayfish (Cherax destructor, Procambarus clarkii) is regulated by the day/night cycle. In these studies, we manipulate environmental light conditions and photoreceptors in order to learn more about how light regulates the production of new neurons and locomotory activity. We use two approaches to study the regulatory pathways: indirect interference through stroboscopic and constant light illumination and direct interference with the known photoreceptive systems. We present experimental results showing the effects of strobe and 24-hour light conditions on neurogenesis. We also introduce a new method of studying neurogenesis through the entrainment of locomotory activity patterns and photoreceptive systems of P. clarkii and C. destructor.

"Participating in ongoing research efforts using bacterial strains isolated from a heavy metal contamination site (Paintshop Pond), we examined the potential correlation between heavy metal and antibiotic resistance. Previous studies suggest this resistance may be conferred by plasmidderived gene products. Genomic and plasmid DNA extraction and amplification, as well as chromium, lead and antibiotic sensitivity tests, allowed us to determine the presence of, and correlation between, these types of resistance in our bacterial isolates via constructed phylogenetic trees. In addition, by analyzing the effect of pH on the toxicity of these metals, we investigated the potential role of acid rain in altering bacterial resistance to heavy metals at contamination sites. This study provides a more accurate understanding of the true toxicity of this past pollution and its environmental implications. (Research supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institution.)

Thousands of people organized to protest Goode\xe2\x80\x99s hanging, gathering at rallies, signing petitions and publishing pamphlets with unprecedented urgency. Why? Judges in this period were subject to great scrutiny; was the fame of the judge who tried Goode important?

"Young adult literature provokes controversy wherever it goes. From the classroom to the school library to the public library, young adult books are challenged on the grounds of morality. Questions such as who is challenging and to what they are objecting are explored through interviews, close reading, and historical evidence. In attempting to understand book challenges, both older books such as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Chocolate War and newer books such as Walter Dean Myers\xe2\x80\x99 Fallen Angels are closely examined. There are many different points of view in the book battles to consider, from the librarians and teachers who promote the challenged books to the variety of positions held by the challengers. Overall, the central issue in the young adult literature controversy is what information young adults should have and how should they be able to findthis information. Pornography as Product: A Speech Act Approach to Free Speech Courtney Klaips \xe2\x80\x9906, Philosophy and Biological Chemistry'"
"Pornography is currently protected under the First Amendment, and its protection is controversial. Some argue that pornography should be regulated because of the harms it causes. MacKinnon, by contrast, maintains that pornography is itself, a harm. In particular, she claims that pornography subordinates women. Although it may be initially unclear how speech could do such a thing, speech act theory demonstrates that speech can subordinate. This speech act approach faces several challenges. I argue that since pornography is a product and thus shaped by market forces, these challenges can be avoided, although other challenges are generated. We Were \xe2\x80\x9cBorn This Way\xe2\x80\x9d? The Ethics of Searching for a Gay Gene Ashley D. Hicks \xe2\x80\x9906, Biological Sciences'"
"Studies Recently, scientific research has been published that investigates possible genetic causes of homosexuality. Scientists who continue to search for a gay gene should recognize the impact of their research and its findings. The scientific community should acknowledge the legacy of past medicalization of homosexuality and allow members of the LGBT community to have a voice in research decisions. The search for a gay gene, coming on the heels of research for genetic causes of cancer and heart disease, implies that homosexuality is, at best, a biological anomaly. When many governments and societies sanction discrimination and violence against LGBT people, the potential for a gay gene to be used as a tool of homophobia and discrimination must be examined. As pre-implantation genetic diagnosis becomes more common and genetic testing for adults becomes available, the termination of fetuses with a gay gene and genetic discrimination by insurance companies and employers could become a reality.

"Parasocial relationships, defined as the symbolic, one-sided quasi-relationships between a viewer and a mediated personality (Horton & Wohl, 1956), have gained a great deal of recent interest. Adolescent girls may be especially prone to forming these relationships with media figures.

"The focus of my research is a qualitative examination of how current child-care policies in the U.S. affect the daily lives, choices and experiences of low-income women and their families. I have interviewed women with children from central Massachusetts who are in the process of transitioning off of welfare or still receiving welfare. These women all rely on child-care vouchers to attend either school or to work outside of the home and their ability to secure child-care vouchers are crucial to their being able to attain true independence and equality. I feel there are still many misconceptions about both child care and welfare recipients that work together to create an atmosphere of societal apathy. In my research I hope to understand better how low-income women combine their work and family lives while simultaneously struggling daily to make ends meet and to fulfill their welfare and child-care voucher guideline obligations.

"This presentation is the culmination of a semester of qualitative research completed in the seminar EDUC 307, Ethnography of Education and Classroom Discourse. The goal of the course was to understand the inner workings of a class at a small, private liberal arts college, and to analyze interactions that occurred between professor and students. Some of our guiding questions were: What is the culture of this specific classroom? What does it take to be a successful student in this particular class? The surprising results of the discourse analysis yielded possible reasons for the continuous high enrollment of students in this course. The First-Year Experience at Wellesley: Students\xe2\x80\x99 Transition to College Cristin Bates \xe2\x80\x9908, Sociology'"
"Do you feel like Wellesley is your home? This past year I have studied how first-year students develop a sense of belonging at Wellesley. Why are some students able to do this quickly and successfully, while others struggle to feel comfortable here? When and how are students able to strike a balance between course work, participating in extracurricular activities, and socializing with their friends? I considered these types of questions while taking part in discussions at first-year focus groups, examining survey data, and reading scholarly works on the first-year experience. My presentation will focus on what students learn about themselves in their first year, how they decide what is most important to them, and what goals they set for the years ahead.

"Linguistic Sciences/French Wellesley College is a haven for linguistic research on bilingualism, and my thesis project examines the speech habits of the local Japanese-English bilingual population. Code-switching \xe2\x80\x93 the alternation between two languages in a conversation \xe2\x80\x93 is a linguistic phenomenon that occurs frequently within bilingual communities. Code-switching is governed by grammatical constraints and is also influenced by a variety of social factors, such as the participants of the conversation, the location, and the topic under discussion. In order to explore these areas, I recorded conversations of Wellesley College Japanese-English bilinguals and transcribed and analyzed their code-switches. I also constructed a grammatical quiz to test proficient bilinguals\xe2\x80\x99 grammatical judgments of written code-switches. This presentation is an overview of the results I have obtained.

"With this research project, we took a brave leap to analyze ourselves as teachers. In order to examine our classroom talk and our interactions with students, we created a lesson, taught it to peers, and video- and audio-tape recorded it. Next, we transcribed the discourse that occurred during the lesson, analyzed it by using domains (categories), created a taxonomy (a map for understanding our unique classroom culture), and triangulated our findings. The investigation resulted in a crucial and revealing examination of us as teachers. Moreover, the study provided insights into the challenges presented in discussing sensitive topics, such as ethnicity and socio-economic status, in classroom settings.

The Atmosphere and Beyond (short talks) Science Center 104 Low-Energy Electron-induced Oligomerization of CCl4 on Mo(110) Lachelle D. Weeks \xe2\x80\x9906, Chemistry and French'"
"Chemistry The low\xe2\x88\x92energy, electron\xe2\x88\x92induced chemistry of condensed CCl4 has been investigated using postirradiation temperature programmed desorption (TPD). These experiments were motivated by the growing interest in developing facile and economical methods for decomposing CCl4 and other halocarbon environmental pollutants. The experimental procedure involves low\xe2\x88\x92energy (3\xe2\x88\x9250 eV) electron irradiation of nanoscale thin films of CCl4 (~10 \xc3\x85 thickness) grown at 100 K on a Mo (110) single crystal under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions (base pressure ~ 1 \xc3\x85~ 10 \xe2\x88\x929 torr). Results of post-irradiation temperature programmed desorption experiments were used to identify C2Cl4, C2Cl6, C4Cl6, and C6Clx as radiolysis products of CCl4. Neither C4Cl6 nor C6Clx has been previously identified as a \xce\xb3-radiolysis or electron-induced radiolysis product of CCl4. These results suggest that the electron-induced oligomerization of CCl4 produces two\xe2\x88\x92, four\xe2\x88\x92, and six\xe2\x88\x92carbon species but not three\xe2\x88\x92 or five\xe2\x88\x92carbon species. We propose a reaction mechanism involving trichloromethyl (\xe2\x80\xa2CCl3) and dichlorocarbene (:CCl2) radicals. Radial Velocities of Circumstellar Line Features in the Ultraviolet Spectrum of the Binary Star System VV Cephei Amanda Zangari \xe2\x80\x9908, Astrophysics and Mathematics'"
"From 1997 to 2003, the Hubble Space Telescope observed the binary star system VV Cephei. This system consists of a small, hot B-type star orbiting a cool M supergiant star so large, that if placed in the center of our solar system, would stretch beyond the orbit of Jupiter. The M supergiant is further surrounded by an extensive gaseous envelope. Every 20 years, the hot component goes into eclipse behind the cool supergiant. As it emerges, its orbital motion can be used to probe the structure of the extended supergiant envelope. This envelope is produced by rapid mass loss in a \xe2\x80\x9cstellar wind\xe2\x80\x9d from the supergiant, which can be detected through narrow, blue-shifted absorption features in the observed spectra. I will present measurements of the velocity of this wind as determined from these features as observed in different positions within the stars\xe2\x80\x99 orbits.

"I used the Wellesley 24-in. telescope to observe and record the brightness changes of asteroids in the Koronis Family. Then, learning to use the IRAF software for image analysis, I processed and extracted the image data from the pictures taken with the telescope. This data produced light curves which are used to determine rotation periods and spin directions for the asteroids. I will discuss my results, along with some \xe2\x80\x9csurprises in the sky\xe2\x80\x9d and other challenges I encountered when exploring the universe from a research telescope near sea level in southeastern New England.

"The importance of biomedical devices, with an estimated U.S. market of over $5B per year, has created a need to control surface interactions, especially as these devices become smaller and capable of performing more functions. Biomaterials are synthetic or natural materials that interact with a biological system. Using functionalized nanoparticles to form a self-assembled monolayer on varying substrates, the adsorption of proteins and cells to surfaces can be controlled. The focus is on having surface coatings that prevent nonspecific adsorption of proteins. 2-D and 3-D polymers are also studied. Thermoresponsive linear polymer chains are studied for use in surface modification of metals such as gold. Hydrogels are cross-linked polymer networks; here, hydrogels with temperature-dependent water interactions are investigated for use in drug delivery and environmental remediation.

Bach\xe2\x80\x99s Life Lessons: Reflections on Studying and Performing Partita no. 2 in D Minor (long performance) Pendleton West 220 Erika Larson \xe2\x80\x9906, Medical Ethics'"
"It is often said that one could study the unaccompanied violin sonatas and partitas of J.S. Bach and never stop learning them, not because they are prohibitively technical but because to perform them requires a lifetime of experiences. Despite this daunting description, the first and most challenging step is often simply to learn the notes and move on from there to add personal interpretation to the performance and build from those experiences. The process of learning Partita no. 2 in D Minor has spanned several years from high school through college, from Washington State to Massachusetts, and from one teacher to the next. During that time lessons on patience and dedication have been learned and become more poignant than other lessons learned in life. This performance of the complete unaccompanied partita does not mark the end of the journey but the next step in the process. Political Interventions: From Anarchy to Genocide (short talks) Pendleton West 212 \xe2\x80\x9cCivilizing\xe2\x80\x9d the Military: A Sociological Analysis of Human Rights Education in the U.S. Army Elizabeth Breese \xe2\x80\x9906, Sociology'"
"Modernity is characterized by the rise in military technology and capacity for destruction as well as by the development of a human rights culture throughout the world. My study analyzes the ways in which the two trajectories have become increasingly interrelated in the Army through the development of human rights education in the military. The ongoing public debate regarding human rights abuses and torture by members of the U.S. military make the exploration of the treatment of human rights in the military ultimately timely. Through on-site interviews with Army instructors, I explore how the unique elements of the institution of the Army, such as its strict adherence to hierarchy, affect the way in which human rights are taught by the Army. I also take up the question of how human rights are taught to military personnel in terms of the \xe2\x80\x9cWar on Terror.\xe2\x80\x9d (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship.) Organizing Anarchy: Negotiating the Tension between the Assertion of the Individual and the Creation of Collective Good Selina Cruz-Charrez \xe2\x80\x9906, Sociology'"
"Anarchism, the social and political theory characterized by extreme individualism and the radical overthrow of imposed authority, has made a popular resurgence among the contemporary activist culture. The term anarchism is often associated with utter chaos and thus also the absence of organization and cooperation. However, a look at the anarchist community in Boston shows that anarchists are deeply committed to building a culture of mutual aid by eliminating hierarchies within the social sphere of interrelations. Anarchists realize that the freedom of the individual is possible only through society and thus find themselves negotiating the tensions between the ultimate autonomy of the individual with the collective establishment of good. Theoretically based in what Anthony Giddens refers to as the \xe2\x80\x98modern project of the self,\xe2\x80\x99 this presentation is based on my (independent study) honors thesis, which focuses on anarchism as a community activity through which individuals find meaning in their lives.

Michelle Iandoli \xe2\x80\x9906, Sociology'"
"How can the international community best act in assisting genocide victims? How does one balance national sovereignty and international law with the moral compulsion to help those in need? How is sociological analysis useful in thinking about these dilemmas? In this presentation, I will summarize my thesis research about these topics, concentrating on Robert Merton\xe2\x80\x99s sociological theories of the unanticipated consequences of social action. I will give a brief history of the Sudanese conflict and, drawing on Merton\xe2\x80\x99s theories, suggest what might be the most successful strategies for humanitarian intervention in the region.'"
"Each country has erected barriers to trade and implemented subsidies which have distorted trade patterns. These measures alter the allocation of the world\xe2\x80\x99s resources and adversely affect growth opportunities which could benefit the poor. The richer nations have pledged to address the needs of the developing nations at the Doha round of trade talks, but differences among rich and developing nations remain. Our presentation will show the effects of subsidies and trade barriers, and the benefits of eliminating or reducing them. Financial Instability Olga Vidisheva \xe2\x80\x9907, Economics '"
"Financial instability has proven to be costlier for emerging markets than any other shocks, including wars, natural disasters, and changes in terms of trade. The benefits of capital flows are mitigated by recurrent financial crises, such as the Asian crisis of 1997. The crises have large implications on poverty, long-run growth rate, divorce and crime rates. I will talk about the impact of financial instability and solutions proposed for addressing this issue. 9:30 \xe2\x80\x93 10:40 Civil Wars Megan Shum \xe2\x80\x9907, Economics and Spanish, Erin Hung \xe2\x80\x9907, Economics, and Janet  Ng \xe2\x80\x9907, Economics '"
"Although the frequency and magnitude of violent conflicts have decreased significantly during the last decade, severe and costly civil wars continue to plague the world.

Literature and the Arts Romantic Chamber Music: Brahms and Schumann (long performance) Jewett Auditorium Julia Blood \xe2\x80\x9909, Japanese Language and Literature and Neuroscience, Stephanie Kim \xe2\x80\x9909, Neuroscience, Rathika Nimalendran \xe2\x80\x9908, Music, Katherine  Roth \xe2\x80\x9908, Music, and Cecilia Zhou \xe2\x80\x9908, Economics '"
"Robert Schumann\xe2\x80\x99s (18101856) chamber music is a major force of the Romantic Era. His Piano Quintet in E-flat major, op. 44 (1842) is considered one of his supreme works and has remained popular since its premiere by his wife, Clara Wieck Schumann, in 1843. Theme transference throughout all four movements creates a vigorous and exciting work. Johannes Brahms (18331897) followed in Schumann\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps, yet brought Romantic music to a new level with his unique compositional style. The String Quartet, op. 51, no. 2 in A Minor (1873) demonstrates Brahmsian characteristics of slow triplets and mixed rhythms which create a complete compatibility of music and sound. Schumann and Brahms represent some of the greatest and most original chamber music composers of the Romantic Era. Science and Technology Synthesis and Structure (short talks) Science Center 278 Evidence of Hydrogen Bonding in 1,2,4Triazolium Salts Claire Reddy \xe2\x80\x9909, Chemistry '"
"1,2,4Triazolium salts have important applications as customizable ionic solvents. When the anion is varied, an unexpected dependence of the H5 resonance on the anion is observed in CDCl3, greater downfield shifts corresponding with increased anion basicity. It is proposed that this chemical shift results from hydrogen bonding between the anion and H5 in solution. HC correlated NMR spectra were generated for 1allyl4phenyl1,2,4triazolium bromide in CDCl3 at concentrations from 0.04M to 0.6M. As concentration increases, an upfield shift in H5 (12.612.2ppm) and a downfield shift in H3 (9.110ppm) is observed. A possible explanation for this shift is that as concentrations increase, hydrogen bonding to H3 becomes significant, attenuating the acidity of H5. X-ray crystallography of 1allyl4phenyl1,2,4triazolium iodide and 1benzyl4phenyl1,2,4triazolium chloride show the anion located near both H3 and H5 in hydrogen bonding positions. Further investigation includes more X-ray crystallography and computational models.(Research supported by Staley Fund for Cancer-related Research.) New Directions in the Synthesis of a Vancomycin Derivative Incorporating an Unnatural Carbohydrate Residue at the Vancosamine Position Adelaide deGuillebon \xe2\x80\x9908, Chemistry and Joyce Ngai \xe2\x80\x9909, Chemistry '"
"Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is used to treat gram-positive bacterial infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus. Vancomycin functions by blocking the approach of several key enzymes involved in bacteria cell wall biosynthesis. Inappropriate administration of vancomycin over the past twenty years has led to the development of a number of vancomycin-resistant strains of bacteria. In response, researchers have set out to prepare more potent derivatives of vancomycin capable of treating vancomycin-resistant bacterial infections. Here, we present progress towards the synthesis of an entirely new analog of vancomycin that incorporates an unnatural carbohydrate residue at a key position. The proposed derivative will be used to further an understanding of the role of the carbohydrate component in the inhibition of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, and will serve as a foundation for the design and preparation of other glycopeptide antibiotic derivatives that can be used to reverse bacterial resistance. Preparation of Tryptophan Hydroxylase-activated Gadolinium-based NMR Contrast Agent'"
"Biologically site selective NMR contrast agents allow for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of biological activity. We have prepared a gadolinium containing contrast agent, using the 1,4,7,10tetraazacyclododecane N,N\xe2\x80\x99,N\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99,N\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99-tetracetate ligand. To direct this contrast agent to the site of tryptophan hydroxylase activity, we attached tryptophan at one of the acids through an amide linkage. Molecular modeling of this new ligand with a complexed gadolinium ion indicates that the pi electrons of the aromatic ring of the tryptophan interact with the gadolinium ion, resulting in exclusion of water from contact with the complexed metal ion. Upon interaction of the gadolinium complex with tryptophan hydroxylase, it is predicted that the tryptophan ring will fold out from the gadolinium ion, allowing interaction of the water molecules with the gadolinium, and resulting in increased contrast in T1weighted MR images. The synthesis and characterization of the complex, as well as preliminary contrast studies, will be discussed.

"We have investigated the low-energy electron-induced chemistry of several condensed halomethanes (CF3I, CF2Cl2, and CCl4) as a function of incident electron energy and fluence. Our experimental procedure involves temperature programmed desorption experiments following low-energy (1 \xe2\x80\x93 100 eV) electron irradiation of nanoscale thin films (< 10 \xc3\x85 thickness) of halomethane films grown at 100 K on a molybdenum single crystal in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber (p ~ 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9210 Torr). These studies serve to elucidate the pivotal role that low-energy electron-induced reactions play in high-energy radiation-induced chemical reactions in condensed matter. The studies may also provide information valuable to (a) furthering cost-efficient destruction of hazardous chemicals, (b) understanding the electron-induced decomposition of feed gases used in the plasma processing of semiconductor devices, (c) clarifying the role, if any, of low-energy electrons, produced by cosmic rays, interacting with CF2Cl2 and producing Cl atoms that contribute to the formation of the ozone hole, and (d) illuminating the dynamics of electron-induced oligomerization and/or polymerization (Research supported by BellSouth Mentoring in the Sciences Gift and the Office of the Dean of the College.) Determining the Time Evolution of Bose-Einstein Condensate Merideth Frey \xe2\x80\x9907, Physics '"
"Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) \xe2\x80\x93 produced when atomic gases are cooled to near absolute zero \xe2\x80\x93 offer a macroscopic way to view the quantum mechanical world. In order to measure certain properties of these condensates, the cooled gas must be released from its potential trap and allowed to expand. Oftentimes an analytic solution for the time-evolution of the BEC wave-function after release from the trap cannot be found and a numerical solution is needed. By applying a recent numerical method for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, the time-evolution for BEC after release from potential traps of various geometries can be found. These numerical solutions can show interference effects when two condensates overlap, allowing a unique macroscopic observation of the quantum behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates.

"A symbiotic star system consists of a small, hot star accreting material from a large, cooler companion star. For more than a decade, Wellesley professors and students have observed these stars using Wellesley\xe2\x80\x99s 24inch Sawyer telescope and analyzed their brightness fluctuations. To prepare the results of these observations for publication, I wrote a computer program to check observation dates among several databases and modified the analysis programs to be compatible with the way the CCD camera data is currently being read out. When we discovered that a limitation with the old configuration of the CCD camera might have caused errors in the results, I carried out a new observing program to assess the impact. Wellesley\xe2\x80\x99s observations will contribute to a growing body of knowledge about these fascinating star systems. (Research supported by the Office of the Dean of the College.)

"Nanoscale surface modification has potential for use in biomedical and marine applications including the mitigation of fouling, or adhesion of cells or organisms to a surface. In biomedical applications, cell or protein adhesion to an implantable device can impair proper device function. In marine environments, fouling of ships adds drag to the ship, thus increasing fuel consumption and green house gas emissions. To prevent fouling, surfaces can be coated with self-assembling thin films. We are examining the fundamental properties of thin films made from functionalized gold nanoparticles and polymers. The moderate to long-term stability of gold nanoparticle-based thin films and the thermo-responsive behavior of N-isopropylacrylamide-based polymers are being investigated. Gold nanoparticles are biocompatible and can also be used for the delivery of treatment to cells.

"As a user of a server, one is forced to trust the system administrators who maintain the system. Each system administrator who has access to the super-user account has unbridled access to all of the computer\xe2\x80\x99s resources. When an administrator obtains super-user access, the system is at her mercy. My work implements a security policy that divides the super-user\xe2\x80\x99s authority into a set of flexible roles. This prevents a single system administrator from having full control over the system. My system also provides an election mechanism that governs the administrative roles so no one administrator can govern roles. If any administrator needs to change a role, the election mechanism needs to be used, allowing all of the administrators to vote on the proposed change and committing it if the vote passes. By inserting this level of indirection to govern roles, no one malicious administrator can obtain the equivalent of super-user access. Reputation in Evolutionary Prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma Hitomi Yoneya \xe2\x80\x9907, Computer Science and Economics '"
"My thesis will determine whether reputation (defined by mutual ratings) can facilitate cooperation in a community where individuals have an incentive to cheat others. The situation in which players have an incentive to cheat, but collectively they would be better off if they cooperated, is called the Prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma (PD). For example, in electronic commerce, the buyer has an incentive to cheat (not pay) and so does the seller (not send the product). I am studying whether cooperation can be achieved through reputation, like the customer review systems in ecommerce companies such as Amazon.com. I developed a simulation program that allows an observer to create, modify, and run simulations of PD. I have extended this simulator with a reputation system and a hill-climbing procedure for finding the evolutionary stable state. The simulations will determine whether cooperation can be achieved through realistic reputation systems. Narrative and Interactivity in Video Games Sarah Abraham \xe2\x80\x9907, Media Arts and Sciences and Russian '"
"Unlike previous forms of artistic media, video games provide entertainment that interacts with the user. Academic study of video games is still limited because of their recent development, but meaningful analysis of the medium requires techniques suitable for understanding the relationship between narrative and interactivity. Since narrative implies inevitability while interactivity gives choices to the player, the two elements appear contradictory, yet the two aspects can have a synergistic relationship within game environment, game atmosphere, and characterization of the player\xe2\x80\x99s avatar. Depictions of the game space during cinematics provide hints and goals for actual gameplay, while the in-game space directs the events of the narrative. The mood created with cinematics carries over to the atmosphere of the gameplay, just as gameplay atmosphere affects the mood of cinematic events. In the same way, the characters\xe2\x80\x99 in-game appearance and abilities create a sense of personality, which cinematics further develop.

"Women have always been healers. They have cared for children and sick neighbors. They have experimented with herbs and innovative methods of healing. They were midwives and birth coaches, abortionists and counselors. They were the beginning of medicine and the power underneath it that maintains itself today. Women were not admitted to any medical schools until the late 1800s, and it was not until the 1970s that their enrollment went above 5%. During this time, women were kept out of medicine based on assertions of inferior control of their emotions, intellect, and general disagreement of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s true place. Since they were first rebuked for their sex, women have fought hard to become an integral and dynamic part of the medical profession.

"The term sweatshop was coined in Britain in the nineteenth century in reference to \xe2\x80\x9cthe sweated trades.\xe2\x80\x9d Although many assume that sweatshops are a thing of the past, sweatshops continue to exist in the United States. Most of all, sweatshops continue to exploit immigrants since they lack political authority and human capital. In my research, I interviewed two siblings who emigrated from Mexico. Both have worked in sweatshops since their arrival in the United States. My goal was to discover what brought them into this field, what has caused them to remain in the field, what their experiences have been in sweatshops and if there was a difference in treatment between the genders. Results indicate that gender does not play an important role in the exploitation process within sweatshops. I argue that this is due to the desire of the employer to pay the lowest possible wage to any individual regardless of sex. Women in Information Technology (IT)'"
"In the U.S., only about 35% of IT workers are female. This number has actually declined from 41% to 34.9% from 1995 and 2002. Similarly, the percentage of women in full-time, first-year undergraduate enrollment in engineering has dropped from 19.9% in 1996 to 16.3% in 2005. These statistics are evidence that there are few women in IT careers, and the numbers are dropping. What is going on here? How is it that in today\xe2\x80\x99s modern world, where women are fast catching up with (or surpassing) men in almost every field, we find a growing gender gap in IT? In this presentation, I draw together research and information from a wide variety of sources in an effort to explain this phenomenon. I then examine one case history, my own, in light of this research on women in computing. Natural and Unnatural Resources (short talks) Pendleton West 116 \xe2\x80\x9cSo Much to Extract, So Little Time\xe2\x80\x9d: Natural Resource Use in Latin America Catherine A. Silvey \xe2\x80\x9907, Political Science and Spanish '"
"Latin America is rich in natural resources; it has expansive tropical forests, large reserves of nonrenewable resources such as gas and oil, and a diverse range of wild flora and fauna. However, rapid deforestation and the exhaustion of petroleum resources pose possible threats for the individual states within Latin America, as well as for the maintenance of security within the region. Factors such as poverty, distribution of land and assets, population growth, income distribution, and a lack of government regulation can shape the way natural resources are treated in individual countries and communities within Latin America. I analyze how these factors are linked to the recent trends in deforestation and oil extraction, and what these findings say about general natural resource use in the region. Cold-war Menace or Climate Salvation? Nuclear Energy and Public Opinion'"
"As oilfields are depleted and energy security becomes more tenuous, determining the cause of public reactions to all alternative forms of energy becomes more and more important.

Some argue that nuclear energy is the only technology which can possibly reduce the world\xe2\x80\x99s use of fossil fuels quickly and to a low enough level to have any impact on global warming. If this is the case, any effort to increase the amount of energy produced by nuclear technology will need to have an accurate understanding of what members of the public are concerned about and what influences their opinion. I examine polling data on national support of nuclear energy to characterize a county\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the technology and its relationship to factors like education and concern about climate change. Not a Drop to Drink: Willingness to Pay for Clean Drinking Water in a Typical Neighborhood in Calcutta, India Shaheli Guha \xe2\x80\x9907, Computer Science  and Economics '"
The World Health Organization states that people have a right to access clean drinking water. Dirty water is a major source of communicable diseases in the developing world. Yet the United Nations estimates that there are over one billion people in the world who live without access to safe drinking water near their homes. Asia and Africa have the worst quality of drinking water. Studies have shown that the water supply in the city of Calcutta in India is often unfit for human consumption. This study aims at finding the willingness to pay for clean drinking water in a typical neighborhood in Calcutta. Knowledge of the citizens\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to pay for potable water will help the city water board to better distribute water resources based on the demand for water. Ethics in Action (short talks) Pendleton West 212 Closing the God Gap: The Democratic Party and the Use of Values Rhetoric  in 2006'
"The 2004 election perpetuated the idea that the Republican Party is the party of religion, faith, and morality. In 2006, the Democratic Party made a concerted effort to challenge this assumption. I will examine four case studies: the Senate races in Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. Candidates from both parties in each of these states mobilized their bases through reaching out to progressive faith groups, spoke with religious leaders who represented a variety of ideologies, broadcast their message on religious radio, framed their issue stances with values, and discussed their personal faith with voters in their speeches and advertisements. I will examine the variety in outreach techniques used, how factors such as authenticity and political climate influenced the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 use of these techniques, and their varying effects on the outcomes of the races World Population Growth vs. Reproductive Rights: The Ethics of Automatic Birth Control Lindsey Silver \xe2\x80\x9907, Philosophy and Political Science '"
"In \xe2\x80\x9cSex and Consequences: World Population Growth vs. Reproductive Rights,\xe2\x80\x9d Margaret Battin proposes that we address the global overpopulation crisis by making all people use \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic\xe2\x80\x9d birth control. Devices such as IUDs and subdermal implants provide constant contraception, so individuals who use those types of birth control must actively choose to have children by removing the device. Battin argues that if the implants were universal and reversible, they would curb population growth, decrease abortions, and avoid the moral problem of doctors deciding who can have children. I asked a variety of people, including Wellesley students and faculty members, to read the article, after which I interviewed them about the article and about why Battin\xe2\x80\x99s idea was morally problematic for them.  I will discuss the issues that emerged from those interviews and how I responded to them in order to defend Battin\xe2\x80\x99s idea. The Status of the Fetus and the Permissibility of Abortion in the Jewish Ethical Writings of Rashi and Maimonides'"
"Abortion is one of the most ethically controversial medical procedures available. From antiquity to the present, Jewish rabbis and scholars such as the medievalists Rashi and Maimonides have wrestled with such issues as the status of the fetus and the permissibility of abortion. Based on his interpretation of Talmudic passages, Rashi adopted a model of the fetus as not nefesh, which became a basis for permitting abortions in a broad range of situations. In contrast to Rashi, Maimonides\xe2\x80\x99 model of the fetus as rodeph provides much stricter criteria for permitting abortions. These two models have formed the basis for much of the abortion discussion in Jewish sources rooted in the Jewish textual tradition. Interestingly, the writings of Maimonides and Rashi on abortion bear similarities to the theories of modern bioethicists such as Don Marquis, Bonnie Steinbock, and Mary Anne Warren.

"Israeli and Palestinian national narratives of victimhood and the \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d frame individual acts of violence as part of an epic struggle fought by morally asymmetric forces. By studying the evolution of the media discourse on violence and victimhood in two Israeli and two Palestinian newspapers, I hope to illuminate how representations of the \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d and the religious and nationalist connotations of the terminology employed influence how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is perceived at home. In my comparative analysis I am focusing on the time period since the kidnapping of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit on June 25, 2006, which sparked the most recent wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence in the Gaza Strip. Viewing the conflict through Palestinian and Israeli news reports, I seek to understand the implications of this discourse for future Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, given the linguistic acknowledgements of the legitimacy of the \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d that have been demanded before the start of negotiations.

"King Philip\xe2\x80\x99s War, an Indian rebellion against the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1675, was the deadliest war in American history. The war challenged social and cultural identities and suggested new answers to the question of what it meant to be Puritan, English, or Indian. This study considers the manner in which different historical figures recorded their stories of the war and the role those stories played in constructing a more divided society. A Puritan woman held captive by Wampanoags, an English military commander, and a Native American patriot all saw the past in very different ways. Each was forced to consider the war\xe2\x80\x99s place in the larger story of New England\xe2\x80\x99s colonial past as well as in their cultural identity. Even while discussing the same conflict, each had a very different story to tell about what King Philip\xe2\x80\x99s War meant to their society.

"There are few excavations in the modern world that can shake the foundations of human evolutionary theory like Dmanisi, Georgia, the earliest hominid site outside Africa. There are also few processes more capable of interfering with the objective interpretation of excavation findings than national ideology. For this reason, an investigation into the reciprocal influence of nation building and paleoanthropology is an ethical necessity. Today the excavations constitute a significant component of Georgian cultural heritage (e.g. Homo georgicus). This presentation considers ethnic, political, and religious factors in Georgian national identity in order to evaluate the influence of national context on the scientific contributions of Dmanisi.

Colonialism, Nationalism, and Modernization: Conflicting Discourses in Haifa under the British Mandate Elise Duryee-Browner \xe2\x80\x9907, International Relations and History '"
"Under the British Mandate for Palestine, various groups competed for control of space and resources in Haifa, a port city in what is now Northern Israel. Unlike the other major cities in Palestine during the 1930s, Tel-Aviv-Jaffa and Jerusalem, Haifa\xe2\x80\x99s residents led a more cosmopolitan life; Jews, Arabs, and a surprising number of other ethnic groups lived and worked together in the city\xe2\x80\x99s old quarters. But increasing Jewish immigration to Palestine and the advent of the British Mandate caused major shifts in Haifa\xe2\x80\x99s structure. This project examines the process by which Haifa\xe2\x80\x99s cosmopolitanism gave way to sectarian violence and increasing segregation, paying particular attention to competition for ownership of space within the city, and the discourses used to maintain this dominance.

United States\xe2\x80\x99s Noninterventionist Policies during the Spanish Civil War Isabel Lecompte, \xe2\x80\x9908, International Relations and History '"
"Ethical debates concerning intervention have a long history in the United States. From the Spanish Civil War to the conflicts in Vietnam and now Iraq, the defense of democracy has been one of the guiding principles for American actions. In the Spanish Civil War a democratically elected government was denied direct assistance, which resulted in a dictatorship, and possibly contributed to the onset of World War II. During the conflict, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 government assumed a position of neutrality and placed a moral embargo for arms that further jeopardized the Spanish republican government. The threat of communism, the policy of appeasement towards belligerent regimes, and isolationist feelings were expressed across different sectors of American society, which lobbied against intervention.

"The issue of hunger and malnutrition is a serious problem, with its effects spanning the course of many generations. With an estimated one billion people suffering from malnutrition, it is obvious why the United Nations has placed the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger as the first priority in its Millennium Development Goals. Hunger and malnutrition is a pressing issue that must be addressed immediately; debate around this issue centers on how best to address it. Research suggests that merely encouraging economic growth would not suffice; small-scale programs such as vitamin A immunizations or micronutrient dietary supplementation might also play an encouraging role in efficiently negating the unfortunate dilemma of hunger and malnutrition.

Science and Technology A Chemical Approach to the Treatment of Type II Diabetes Mellitus (panel) Science Center 104'"
"We are investigating the deficiencies in the insulin-induction pathway in type II diabetes mellitus. In a normal insulin-producing pathway, food enters the intestine and stimulates the production of small molecule GLP1. GLP1 then travels to the pancreas where it stimulates its receptor and results in the production of insulin. Insulin allows cells of the body to uptake glucose, whose metabolism provides the cells with the energy required to run the body. Type II diabetics show resistance to the level of insulin their body naturally produces. Our projects aim to determine the molecular mechanisms of the interactions of GLP1 and its receptor in the insulin-induction pathway in hopes of developing a more efficient therapeutic treatment for type II diabetes mellitus.

"The popularity of organic gardening is increasing, as this method of horticulture is healthy for both plants and humans. The Margaret Ferguson Greenhouse at Wellesley College uses both organic and chemical methods to control pests and promote overall plant health. The goal of my experiment was to determine which process was best for one species (Calendula officianalis) that, like many plants grown quickly for greenhouse display, is a magnet for pests. Calendulas were grown using different soil treatments consisting of compost, worm castings, and synthetic vs. organic fertilizer. Bloom counts measured which plants were best aesthetically and insects were monitored to determine which treatment was most pest resistant. A Chlorophyll A-Fluorometer ascertained plant stress and the shoot biomass demonstrated which treatment harbored the best growth.

"Most American parents do not live with the fear that one day their parental rights will be terminated. Yet incarcerated mothers live with that fear daily. U.S. laws and their related policies and practices regarding termination of parental rights uniquely and unjustly impact incarcerated mothers causing them to be at high risk for losing their parental rights. Ideals and concepts about motherhood, criminality, race and class drive these laws and practices. My thesis argues that these ideals and concepts contribute to unjust parental right terminations for incarcerated mothers, thereby traumatizing the mothers and children involved. I offer a rethinking of those ideals and concepts and recommend alternative programs and policies that would minimize unjust parental right terminations for incarcerated mothers.

"This study examined the relationship between body image and two faces of narcissism: overt or grandiosity-exhibitionism and covert or vulnerability-sensitivity. Narcissistic individuals include people whose lives focus on issues of self-definition, self-worth, identity, and autonomy. In its broadest interpretation, narcissism can be characterized as self-investment. In its most adaptive form, this self-investment serves to enhance psychological wellbeing and promote positive feelings about oneself. In its maladaptive form, narcissistic individuals are most often characterized by negative behaviors such as exaggerated self-entitlement, exploitation, and grandiosity. One hundred and ninety Wellesley students completed multiple measures of narcissism and body image. Results are expected to demonstrate a positive correlation between body image and overt narcissism and a negative correlation between body image and covert narcissism.

Given some recent pornography produced by women for women, could there be a new conception of it as a medium for both men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s erotic pleasure? These are some of the questions I will present in my dissection of the history of pornography, the recent debate, and the conflicting perceptions of pornography as sexual violence as well as a site of erotic exploration. College students were interviewed about their perceptions and use of pornography, and how it influenced their sex lives. I will also discuss conflicting assumptions about gender and sexuality, and their influence on U.S. society. Japanese Girls\xe2\x80\x99 Culture and Boy\xe2\x80\x99s Love'"
"Boy\xe2\x80\x99s Love is a genre of Japanese girls\xe2\x80\x99 popular culture that depicts relationships between male characters with an emphasis on emotion, love, and personal interaction. Within this general framework is a large variety of media and subject matter that Boy\xe2\x80\x99s Love, both as a cultural and commercial phenomenon, possesses. Previous research on the genre has largely failed to realize this variety. By analyzing several mainstream, contemporary examples of the genre, a more accurate depiction can be achieved. This study focuses on the history of Boy\xe2\x80\x99s Love manga, its unique cultural characteristics, and its reception in the global marketplace.

"In the twenty-first century, more and more people belong to several communities in several places at once. They are redefining the boundaries of belonging, creating new kinds of memberships and citizenships that have the potential to challenge longstanding class and power inequalities. Through the Transnational Studies Initiative at Harvard University, we became involved in a series of events exploring the artistic and cultural products of transnational identities and their position with respect to ethnic and homeland art.

Economic Issues Essentials of Life: Health and Housing (short talks) Pendleton East 239 The Impact of Welfare Reform on Immigrant Health Audrey Stern \xe2\x80\x9907, Economics '"
"The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act involved substantial changes in immigrant eligibility for public assistance. Before the reform, immigrants had access to welfare programs on the same basis as citizens. Following the reform, immigrant access varied depending on their state of residence, as the reform let states decide whether to continue to offer immigrants access to welfare programs, and year of arrival, as only those immigrants who arrived after the reform\xe2\x80\x99s enactment were affected. As a result, immigrant eligibility for public benefits has been reduced to a greater extent than citizen eligibility and immigrants face far wider variation across states in their access to safety-net services. I explore these state-level differences in program eligibility to estimate the effect of welfare reform on the health of immigrant children using the Vital Statistics Linked Birth Infant Death Data Set. The Changing Psychology and Demographics of the Housing Market'"
"The equity in their home is the largest asset in the portfolio of the vast majority of households. During the last 12 years, home prices have more than tripled. They are now falling. A continuing downturn in the housing market could have serious consequences for households and for the underlying economy. Strong evidence suggests that consumer spending by households responds to changes in wealth, including housing wealth. Furthermore, any drop in construction can have a direct effect on GDP growth. Finally, a sharp decline in prices would be likely to cause a rise in mortgage loan defaults and foreclosures and could cause serious problems for financial markets. This thesis is designed to shed light on two important aspects of price determination in the recent downturn: demographics and psychology. To do so, I sent out 1,000 surveys to a randomly selected sample of buyers and sellers in the Boston housing market during the time of the recent slowdown.

Iuliana Pascu \xe2\x80\x9907, Economics and Mathematics '"
"Medicare Part D, the new prescription drug benefit program which started in January 2006, represents the single most significant expansion of public insurance programs in the U.S. in the past 40 years. To date, it offers subsidized drug coverage to 22.5 million seniors. The government delegated the delivery of the drug benefit to private insurers, arguing that market competition will help to drive prices down. Initially, there was concern that some states would not have enough plans supplied in order to ensure a competitive environment. But the opposite has happened, the set of possible options was wide ranging: in some cases people had to choose between more than 50 different plan options, with varying coverage benefits. Given the limited information available to the patients and the uncertainty inherent in this kind of decision, my project uses discrete choice models to analyze how people made choices from among these myriad programs.

"Health-related issues and concerns are not dictated solely by science and technology, but are greatly determined by history, politics, economics, and power relations. As such, social and cultural contingencies not only influence the form and scope of diseases, they also largely shape a patient\xe2\x80\x99s and a community\xe2\x80\x99s experience of illness. This study primarily investigated the ways in which the experience of cancer is constructed through socially or culturally organized processes. To this end, the study examined the relationships of power within an oncology ward by delineating and deconstructing the objective and subjective perspectives of both patients and health care providers. Through an analysis of patient-physician narratives and nonverbal practices gleaned through participant-observation, literature research and interviews, the project provides an interpretation of and insight into the structures and processes of power, knowledge, and authority that inform and deform a patient\xe2\x80\x99s experience with cancer.

Medieval Dream Poetry and Visionary Translations (short talks) Pendleton West 117 Writing Destiny: Dido, Aeneas, and the Power of a Poet'"
"In his Legend of Good Women, Chaucer devotes his most extensive narrative to the tragic story of Dido and Aeneas, their brief romance, and the betrayal that the Queen suffers. Despite bookend references to Virgil and Ovid, Chaucer drastically alters the tone and focus of the famous romance by removing one fundamental element: the fated purpose of Aeneas\xe2\x80\x99 travels that is the eventual founding of the Roman Empire. While analyzing Chaucer\xe2\x80\x99s depiction of Dido, Aeneas, and their relationship, we will explore the author\xe2\x80\x99s modification of a seminal classical text, and the artistic gumption that such changes reflect in Chaucer himself. Finally, considering the historical circumstances surrounding the composition of both Virgil\xe2\x80\x99s Aeneid and Chaucer\xe2\x80\x99s Legend of Good Women, we will explore the effect of cultural and political influences on a romance that at its heart bears the mark of political sacrifice and the building of the empire.

"Chaucer\xe2\x80\x99s House of Fame, written around 137980, is arguably his most bookish, idiosyncratic effort: packed into its 2158 lines are the medieval science of sound and motion, epic lists and other rhetorical flourishes, and multiple allusions to other writers like Dante, Virgil, and Boethius. For all its quirks, The House of Fame is a lucid (albeit incomplete) exposition of the thematic concerns that underlie The Canterbury Tales, such as the capacity of language to clarify and obfuscate, the temporality of earthly fame, and the tension between \xe2\x80\x9csentence\xe2\x80\x9d (earnest) and \xe2\x80\x9csolaas\xe2\x80\x9d (game).

In his religious dream-vision \xe2\x80\x9cPerle,\xe2\x80\x9d a bereaved man sees a vision of his daughter who died in early childhood, although she is now a queen in Heaven. In my presentation, I will explore the dynamics of the grieving narrator\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with the heavenly apparition of his departed daughter through the highly elaborate structure and language of the dialogue, as well as the religious aspects of the language and the poem\xe2\x80\x99s lush symmetry. Chaucer\xe2\x80\x99s Portrayal of Women Before the Canterbury Tales'"
"In his early poetry, Chaucer presents us with the range of women that we will later meet in the Canterbury Tales. For example, the Lady Whyte, in his first poem The Book of the Duchess, and Cleopatra, from the first tale in the Legend of Good Women, are opposites. They are both women who were loved by powerful and masculine men/warriors. However, the Lady Whyte is portrayed with no tangibility, substance, or voice. She is the ideal medieval woman. Cleopatra is her ironic inversion, portrayed as a powerful woman who was passionate and took an active role by her husband\xe2\x80\x99s side. The oppositions between these two women help us to interpret the roles they play in their respective poems and foreshadow the different images of the feminine that Chaucer will present in his later writing.

"Geoffrey Chaucer was a poet, an entertainer, an ugly guy. He was also a wishful thinker. In his dream vision, The Parliament of Fowls, he creates a fantastical world where birds convene to choose their mates on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Through the focal point of a female eagle, Chaucer concerns himself with the question of choice \xe2\x80\x93 do we have it? How much of our choices are dictated by society? To what extent does decision, or indecision, raise or lower one\xe2\x80\x99s power? Chaucer gives his fowl female the ultimate decision to choose a lover, but he leaves his reader wondering whether free will is simply an illusion.

I consider how one might learn the definition of the primitive predicate on in a 3D world of blocks, where the task is to build stacks of blocks. I study the role of visual information in determining whether an on relationship exists, using machine learning algorithms to learn the definition of on given training data from a perceptual study. I then use the definitions learned from different feature subsets to learn planning rules. The usefulness of these planning rules will determine the quality of each definition, and the relevance of the visual features used. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship.)

These results suggest that certain aspects of syntax can be shared between a bilingual\xe2\x80\x99s languages. My study attempts to replicate these findings in Russian-English bilinguals. In addition, while previous studies have examined bilinguals as a single group, my study compares early bilinguals, who grew up speaking two languages, to late bilinguals, who learned their second language after puberty. Such a comparison will shed light on whether different types of bilinguals organize the syntax of their two languages differently. (Research supported by Wellesley College Funds and a Jerome A.

"Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is a soluble metalloendopeptidase that has been isolated in a variety of cell types, such as brain, pituitary, and the testes. TOP metabolizes a variety of bioactive peptides and is implicated in the regulation of many physiological processes. Results from several laboratories, including our own, suggest that TOP can metabolize an unusually wide range of substrates due to flexibility of a loop opposite the binding pocket. For this study, we have conducted kinetic assays in the presence of reagents that induce flexibility or rigidity. We have examined activity of TOP towards substrates of different sizes, and have engineered the enzyme itself for decreased flexibility. Our data show that increasing rigidity improves the activity of TOP towards a small substrate whereas increasing flexibility enhances the activity of TOP towards a larger substrate.

"Cyanobacteria, this planet\xe2\x80\x99s oldest known organisms, are photosynthetic bacteria important in maintaining oxygen in the earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere. They are alkaliphilic and have been shown to increase the pH of their environment via several postulated means, including amino acid decarboxylation, when placed in acidic media. Amino acid decarboxylases are enzymes that catalyze the reaction in which a carboxyl group is removed from amino acids as carbon dioxide. Secretion of the resulting highly basic amine will raise the pH of the environment. We are using a carbon dioxide assay for decarboxylase activity and Western Blot analysis for decarboxylase synthesis in order to determine whether increased activity and/or increased synthesis of amino acid decarboxylases are part of the acid stress response of cyanobacteria. Current data have shown both increased decarboxylase activity and increased decarboxylase synthesis in acid stressed bacteria, suggesting that amino acid decarboxylation is involved in the acid stress response of cyanobacteria.

"Antimicrobial peptides are short proteins that are produced by a wide variety of  organisms to kill bacteria and other microbial cells. Buforin II, a 21amino acid peptide isolated from the stomach of the Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans, is one such peptide, which enters its target cells and destroys them through subsequent binding to DNA. Our research focuses on how buforin II interacts with these lipid membranes. We examined the interaction of buforin II with lipid membranes of varying chemical characteristics and concentrations. Previous work in the Elmore lab has considered interactions with membranes consisting of only phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol. However, our studies include two additional lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, which allows us to study how buforin II interacts with more physiologically relevant membranes.

"In addition to the complex immune system that organisms employ to deal with foreign objects and diseases, a more basic form of host defense consists of small antimicrobial peptides. One such peptide, buforin II, a more potent form of the buforin I peptide isolated from the Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans, enters the cell via formation of pores in the cell membrane. In order to better understand the membrane translocation mechanism of buforin II on a molecular level, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of buforin II-lipid membrane interactions using GROMACS. By applying a transmembrane potential, we have biased the entry of buforin into the membrane on the simulation timescale. In an age where bacterial resistance to drugs and antibiotics increases rampantly, studying antimicrobial peptides is important as they demonstrate promise as novel therapeutic agents, possessing a broad range of activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses, and even cancerous cells.

"Compared to other vertebrates, goldfish (Carassius auratus) are unique in their capacity to endure for up to five days with no environmental oxygen. Previous data from our laboratory suggest that the activation of specific ion channels is one factor that helps to protect vulnerable tissues under low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions. Hypoxia-induced activation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the heart, for example, may serve to increase tolerance of low oxygen. The purpose of this study was to resolve the mechanism by which this channel is activated when oxygen levels are low, and, specifically, to assess the role of nitric oxide (NO)-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (GC) and protein kinase G (PKG) in channel opening. Our data suggest that increased activity of GC is involved in the opening of KATP channels, but that this response is independent of PKG.

By analyzing two cases \xe2\x80\x93 the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999 and the Spy plane Collision on Hainan Island in 2001 \xe2\x80\x93 this project seeks to document and explain how domestic legitimacy concerns and relative power constraints influence China\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy choices rather than expansionist or hegemonic ambitions. The research shows that new Chinese nationalism implies popular awareness of and, to some degree, mass participation in politics. Consequently, nationalism has become a constraint in China\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy, limiting the Chinese state\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make foreign policy decisions at its will. France in the Edwardian English Popular Imagination Ariella Huff \xe2\x80\x9907, History '"
"Throughout centuries of military and political rivalry, France has served as mirror, model, and challenge to English self-perception. During the early years of the twentieth century, however, the Entente Cordiale enabled the nascent development of a deep and enduring political alliance. In a reflection of political change, this climate of friendship before the First World War facilitated the burgeoning of the contemporary relationship between the English and the French publics. Drawing upon original research from a wide variety of sources, this talk will address the effects of this new political reality on popular English perceptions of their old rivals across the Channel, focusing on the prominent themes of politics, art, and culture. In addition, I aim to show how shifts in perceptions of France reflected Edwardian England\xe2\x80\x99s changing conceptions of its own national identity.

"This presentation analyzes the way in which soccer helped to rebuild German nationalism in the post-World War II era. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, the German people lost all sense of pride in their nation. Far more than a national pastime, German soccer gave the country a renewed sense of patriotism beginning with the World Cup victory in 1954. When Germany successfully hosted the World Cup in 1974, it proved to the international visitors that it had become a welcoming and democratic country. After German reunification, a united national team of East and West Germans went on to win the World Cup in 1990. In 2006, Germany again played host to the World Cup and, for the first time since 1945, German flags decorated everything from shop windows to cars to strollers. This type of healthy patriotism, standard in most countries, is a revolutionary change in postwar Germany. The Failure of East Germany and Its Aftermath from a Generational Perspective Ana Ila \xe2\x80\x9909, German Language and Literature '"
"For post-World War II generations, the German Democratic Republic (GDR), East Germany, was a solution to the problem of Nazism and a path towards socialism. However, later generations felt that the GDR and its institutions (especially the \xe2\x80\x9cStasi\xe2\x80\x9d) took their political freedom away as the system required sacrifice of ideology and lifestyle. Hence, members of the younger generations wanted the system to be replaced. However, the reunification of Germany did not succeed in integrating the younger generations of East Germans into the newly established society. The attempt of German institutions to identify ex-Stasis and prosecute them when possible disrupted the process of creating a common culture already disturbed by fifty years of separation. Since the older generations did not solve the problem, the young ones are left unassisted in this transition. Perceptions and Human Interactions (poster session) Science Center Focus Decision-making Determinants in 2x2 Global Games: Some Experimental Results Chenying Zhang \xe2\x80\x9907, Economics and Mathematics '"
"Many important economic phenomena are modeled as coordination games. For example, bank runs and currency crises can be modeled as coordination games with incomplete information about payoffs; this type of game is referred to as a \xe2\x80\x9cglobal\xe2\x80\x9d game. Most of the existing work on global games is theoretical and few experimental results have been reported. I designed an experiment to test whether players perform as the theory predicts in a 2x2 global game and to determine whether behavior converges to the complete information equilibrium. The experiment results show that the mere existence of uncertainty regarding payoffs has an enormous impact on player behavior and that player behavior does not conform to the theoretical prediction. I propose several explanations for the observed behavior. Because the 2x2 game serves as the most basic model of the generalized multiperson global game, the experimental results have important implications for building financial models.

"This study examined the effects of perceptions of others based on what they ate, and what their mood was at the time of the meal. Female participants provided impression ratings through a questionnaire for a female target. The target was presented as being in a positive or negative mood as influenced by an external event, and as eating either healthy or unhealthy meals during that day. The target was perceived as having more positive characteristics overall when she ate healthier meals. Her mood at the time, as influenced by a specific external event, had a greater impact on specific personality characteristics. The interaction between her mood and what she ate also influenced perceptions of her, including perceptions of physical activity and how concerned she was about her general health. Results are discussed in terms of how perceptions of others vary based on what someone eats and his or her mood at the time of the meal.

"While traveling in India as part of the Wintersession program with the Peace and Justice Program, we, as two white women, found ourselves having to confront what it means to be white outside of the United States of America and specifically in India. \xe2\x80\x9cWhite\xe2\x80\x9d became much more than the color of our skin, or a box to check on paperwork, but rather a symbol of our background, our country, and our privilege. Though the focus of the course was nonviolent conflict resolution in India, we found that we ended up addressing conflict within ourselves just as much as in the structures and societies of India. During and after the trip, we worked on developing our sense of white privilege, and examining our motives and interactions during our time in India. At the same time, we came to realize the importance of recognizing and confronting our white privilege. Economic Issues Market Forces (short talks) Pendleton East 239 Executive Stock Option Backdating and Corporate Governance'"
"Over the past decade, corporations have increasingly relied on stock options as a means of compensating executives and aligning the incentives of managers and shareholders. The practice of stock option backdating, in which management manipulates the timing of option grants to the date of a particularly low stock price, has emerged as a topic of particular concern in the past year. Stock option backdating is an issue of corporate governance: it is the absence of sufficient shareholder protections that ultimately allows managers to have a greater amount of influence over the terms of their compensation, including the timing of stock option grants. In my thesis, I examine the extent to which strong shareholder protections mitigate backdating and suggest that companies with strong governance provisions have a lower incidence of backdating due to more stringent controls on management behavior, giving them less freedom to engage in opportunistic behavior. Unraveling the Economic Volatility Decline Puzzle SuiLin Yap \xe2\x80\x9908, Economics and Mathematics '"
"Volatility of the U.S. GDP, its components, and other macro variables such as interest rates, have declined substantially since 1984. Possible explanations include improved monetary policy, better inventory management technology, financial innovations and milder shocks. This collaborative independent study under Professor Case and a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston economist explores to what extent financial innovations can help explain the U.S. economy\xe2\x80\x99s greater stability using a difference-in-difference method. We compare the change in volatility across different types of investment \xe2\x80\x93 business fixed, residential and consumer durables \xe2\x80\x93 with the change in financing frictions for each type. If financial innovations mitigate credit constraints and enable households and firms to better smooth consumption and production respectively, then an investment whose financing arrangements have seen more innovations should experience a larger decline in growth volatility. Furthermore, this study utilizes cross-country variations to explore if  the same mechanism is at work in other G10 nations. Spillover Effects of FDI on Financial Services: Does FDI Promote Local Financial Development in India? ThuHang Tran \xe2\x80\x9907, Economics and Mathematics '"
"India liberalized its economy in 1991 following a severe balance of payments crisis. Major changes included a reform of the Industrial Licensing Policy, and the opening of the economy to foreign direct investment (FDI). Subsequently, during 1991 \xe2\x80\x93 2001, the government further allowed FDI in more industrial sectors. How did this new inflow of capital contribute to India\xe2\x80\x99s recent economic growth? Researchers have previously investigated the effects of FDI on economic growth through technology transfer, but not through the channel of domestic financial development. In this presentation,  I examine whether FDI inflows have benefited local financial services. I will exploit the variation in FDI across districts in India, based on preexisting industrial structure before liberalization and the timing of FDI reform for different industries, to establish whether bank branches and the volumes of credit and deposits increased more in districts that experienced greater FDI inflows. The Impact of Financial Liberalization on Corporate Governance in Emerging Markets '"
"Financial liberalization is the reduction of barriers to cross-border trade of financial assets. Lowering these barriers should theoretically result in increased international capital flows that raise GDP growth and reduce consumption volatility. More recently, economists have proposed alternative channels through which financial liberalization can bring about positive economic outcomes. One of these processes is better corporate governance. Improved investor protection provided by good corporate governance practices encourages investment at the micro level, which spurs economic growth. In my honors\xe2\x80\x99 thesis,  I attempt to establish a causal link between financial liberalization and the quality of corporate governance. I use two measures of corporate governance quality, along with de facto and de jure measures of financial liberalization as independent variables to examine this relationship.  I also use firm and country characteristics to control for other possible determinants of corporate governance.

Differences between the MR images obtained using the two contrast agents demonstrated the selectivity of Mn2+ for neural tissues. Extracellular recording of the crayfish optic nerve was employed to ascertain the optimum intensity of light needed to produce a significant photoreceptor response. The resulting data aided in the production of a light source that best stimulated the crayfish visual system. MR images were then obtained using MEMRI, and the signal intensities of the neurons within the visual system were compared with and without stimulation by the light source.

Comparing Locomotory and PDH Rhythms in C. destructor and P. clarkii to determine Exogenous or Endogenous Source'"
"Circadian rhythms are endogenous cycles of activities oriented around a 24hour period. This study is testing the relationship between locomotory rhythms and levels of Pigment Dispersing Hormone (PDH) in neurons and synaptic areas of the crayfish Procambaraus clarkii and Cherax destructor. In previous studies, P. clarkii shows a locomotory rhythm in constant dark conditions (D/D) reminiscent of that present in 12hr light/12hr dark (L/D), suggesting that locomotion is driven by an endogenous circadian clock. In contrast, C. destructor is arrhythmic in D/D despite having a locomotory rhythm entrained to a 24hr clock while in L/D conditions. In this species, in L/D conditions, PDH levels cycle over a 24hour period in specific neurons and synaptic brain regions. These data suggest that PDH may be an output of the endogenous clock. An assessment of PDH levels in parallel with locomotory rhythms will allow us to determine if there is a tight relationship between these and the endogenous clock.

Human Rights and Abuses  (short talks) Pendleton West 212 Karl Marx and the Anarchists:  A Sociological Analysis of Intellectual Conflict Sanja Jagesic \xe2\x80\x9908, Sociology and German Language and Literature '"
"Karl Marx is notorious for his spiteful attacks on opponents and competitors. His intellectual battles with the anarchists are especially demonstrative of the fundamentally conflictual \xe2\x80\x93 and even combative nature \xe2\x80\x93 of intellectual disputes. This spring semester I have studied three central figures in nineteenth-century anarchism and their intellectual responses and exchanges with Karl Marx: Mikhail Bakunin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and Peter Kropotkin. Throughout the study of these three different intellectual disputes, I have explored examples of varied intensities of intellectual exchange. In this presentation, I will focus on one specific case study of the vitriolic political and intellectual battles between Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin, battles which Marx essentially won, with great historical consequences. My presentation is a sociological analysis of the various aspects and dimensions of intellectual conflict. Marginalizing the Masses: Religious Persecution in Early Modern Europe Jessica Allan \xe2\x80\x9908, History and Peace and Justice Studies '"
"The Spanish Inquisition is well known as an abhorrent abuse of the legal system, of human rights and of the disenfranchised and marginalized members of society. What is not generally known is that during the Spanish Inquisition, the numerical majority of trials were not of Jews, Moors, Protestants, or even a combination \xe2\x80\x93 they were of Spanish Catholics. This interesting topic has not been extensively covered in existing historical writings and has not attracted the attention that it merits. The Inquisition existed originally to rout out Jews and Moors from Spain, but quickly spread to impact all of Spanish society. This presentation will focus on the prosecution of Old Christians in the Spanish Inquisition, and show the evolution of standards originally designed for Moors and Jews becoming the means to prosecute and persecute anyone who contested those in power. Moral Crimes and International Law: Evolution of the Concept of Genocide in the Context of the ICTY Robin Miller \xe2\x80\x9907, Sociology '"
"For lawyers, there is no hierarchy of international crimes; war crimes and genocide are on the same level. For human rights scholars however, genocide is \xe2\x80\x9cthe crime of crimes\xe2\x80\x9d; it is particularly reprehensible because it entails not only the destruction of a people, but the intent to destroy because of victims\xe2\x80\x99 membership in a certain group. I explore the changing conception of genocide within the context of the International Criminal Tribunal of the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), focusing on how \xe2\x80\x9cgenocide\xe2\x80\x9d is differentially defined and utilized by human rights scholars and lawyers. Analysis of ICTY genocide cases, scholarly writings on human rights, and interviews with ICTY prosecutors will reveal the current status of \xe2\x80\x9cgenocide\xe2\x80\x9d as a moral and legal category. Additionally, my thesis examines the moral compromises inherent in prosecution of gross human rights violations. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship.) The Social Construction of Evil:  The Chinese Government\xe2\x80\x99s Persecution of the Falun Gong Movement'"
"The common thread that runs through political persecutions is that persecutors legitimize their actions by identifying the persecuted as evil. This presentation offers a sociological analysis of the social construction of evil. Through the use of ethnographic content analysis of Xinhua, China\xe2\x80\x99s largest circulating newspaper, I examine how the Chinese government justifies its criminalization of the Falun Gong (a new religion banned in China since July 1999). By producing cultural narratives about the FLG that depict them as evil and dangerous, the Chinese government seeks to legitimize its actions against a group by constructing it as deceptive, fraudulent, physically and emotionally harmful to individuals, and a social threat seeking to destabilize Chinese society. Imagination, Creativity, and  Self-construction (short talks) Pendleton East 339 The Nature of Imaginary Companions: Answers from Children and Parents'"
"Nearly half of the children in the United States create imaginary companions at some point during their development, either in the form of invisible friends or personified objects. The current study examines children\xe2\x80\x99s motives for creating imaginary companions and the types of relationships children maintain with these companions. Because children sometimes have difficulty articulating their thoughts, parents are an important source of information. However, parents view the relationship from an outside perspective and may therefore be unaware of certain details about their child\xe2\x80\x99s imaginary companion. For this presentation, I examined data from interviews with preschool children and parents to determine the degree to which children agree with their parents, on both simple questions, such as the imaginary companion\xe2\x80\x99s age and gender, and more complex inquiries into what the child likes about the companion. This analysis will help to determine the differences in parents\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions in this field of research.

"Increasingly, rather than rely on face-to-face interactions to form and maintain romantic relationships, people use the Internet. Are particular personality traits related to a high frequency of Internet-mediated communication with one\xe2\x80\x99s significant other? This study examined the relationship between Internet-mediated communication in romantic relationships and shyness, introversion, self-presentation, and related personality traits. I administered a survey to female undergraduates to assess Internet use, personality variables, and attitudes about romantic relationships. I analyzed participant data based on shyness and introversion levels. I expected that highly shy, introverted participants would use the Internet to mediate romantic relationships with more frequency than extraverted, non shy participants, with other variables qualifying this main hypothesis.

"The researcher examined the relationships among self-determination, flow, and creativity. Students of the visual arts were asked to complete measures of general openness to experience and self-regulation. Participants were also asked to complete measures of intrinsic motivation and flow immediately following sessions in which they were engaged in the creative process. The products resulting from these sessions were then rated by independent judges for creativity. Results were expected to show that flow is most often accompanied by high levels of intrinsic motivation and creativity, and that individuals with high levels of openness to experience and high intrinsic motivation tend to be more creative.

"As both an artist obsessed with perfection and a fervent Christian, the Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky sought to reconcile his artistic principles with Christian dogma in his works, and refrained from indulging in overt preaching for fear of undermining their artistic value. Calling on his own transformation from doubt to faith, however, resulted in anti-Christian arguments so refined and artistically flawless that they threatened to devastate the Christian premise of his works. Responding to critical reviews of Brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky wrote the following: \xe2\x80\x9cThese fools could not even conceive so strong a denial of God as the one to which I gave expression...it is not like a child that I believe in Christ and confess him. My hosanna has come through a crucible of doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d In my senior thesis, I will examine the impact of this perversion of Christian doctrine on a modern reader\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Dostoevsky\xe2\x80\x99s late novels.

With the ambition of attending the Sundance Film Festival, America\xe2\x80\x99s preeminent showcase for \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d cinema, I decided to conduct an independent study on the evolution and significance of this integral aspect of the film industry. After considering the major festivals of Europe (Cannes, Berlin, Venice), I narrowed my course of study to solely focus on Sundance. In just 20 years, this Utah event has changed the face of film production and distribution. My research was consummated at Sundance, where I drew my own conclusions about the genre the festival has spawned and its permanent effects, both positive and negative, on the international film community.

"The two-toed sloth, Choloepus, violates a famous morphological rule: all mammals must have seven cervical vertebrae. The resulting morphology is highly variable and apparently without consequences to survival or general health. In this project we analyze vertebral variation in Choloepus, propose genes responsible for the variant morphology, and test our hypothesis through retrieval and comparison of sloth DNA sequences with the sequences of genes known to cause similar morphologies in experimental animals, such as the mouse. Lung Morphology in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome'"
"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a mutation in the X-linked gene for methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Among the numerous autistic-like symptoms that affect RTT patients, breathing abnormalities are among the most severe, eventually causing death by respiratory arrest in up to 26% of patients. My investigation examines the structural basis for these respiratory symptoms in a MeCP2 knockout mouse model through a histological quantification of pulmonary cell morphology and an immunofluorescence protocol designed to determine the cellular localization of MeCP2 in the mouse lung. The findings of this study will help to elucidate the pathology of breathing abnormalities in RTT patients and could contribute to the development of new therapies that target the structural basis of these symptoms.

"Buforin II is a 21amino acid cationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from the stomach tissue of Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans in 1996. It is hypothesized to target bacteria nonspecifically by crossing biological membranes without membrane permeabilization and binding to DNA. My research focuses on how lipid composition affects membrane binding and translocation of buforin II. The experiments performed utilize lipid vesicles as a model for biological membranes. To this end, I have used a fluorescence titration method to measure the binding of buforin II to lipid vesicles with varying compositions of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine, a negatively charged and neutral lipid. Current results suggest that the binding strength between buforin II and the lipid vesicles increases as the amount of negatively charged lipids increase. I have also adapted a biotin-avidin based protocol to measure buforin II translocation, across lipid vesicles of varying composition. (Research supported by the Office of the Dean of the College.) Biochemical Characterization of LNRA of Human Notch1 and Notch2'"
"The Lin12/Notch Repeat (LNR) module is a small disulfide-rich protein module of 35 residues first identified in Notch receptors, which are proteins involved in controlling cellular differentiation in multicellular animals. The structural importance of the three tandem LNR modules in Notch function is revealed by recent structural data from the extracellular domain of human Notch2. Based on sequence alignments and preliminary biochemical information, LNR repeats are predicted to be also present in PAPP and Stealth proteins. Selective Ca2+ binding and a unique disulfide bonding pattern are critical for the correct folding of the prototype LNR module and are thereby suggested to be the determining features of an LNR module. This work focuses on producing and purifying the first LNR module form Notch1 and Notch2 using a bacterial expression system in preparation for studies to determine the binding affinities of various divalent atoms for these modules.

"In developing countries, programs designed to improve child nutrition are widespread. The ability of such programs to improve the nutrition of individual children depends on how households choose to allocate resources among their members. If one child in a family is given a free meal in school, her parents might transfer some household food to other members of the family, such as her siblings. This implies that policies that target specific individuals in a household may be mostly neutralized by reallocations of the resource away from the child. On the other hand, the transfer may not be reallocated away, a phenomenon referred to as the intra-household \xe2\x80\x98flypaper effect\xe2\x80\x99 because the transfer \xe2\x80\x98sticks\xe2\x80\x99 to the child.

"In 1776, the Declaration of Independence created the United States as a nation guided by the principles of equality, liberty, unalienable rights, and limited government by consent of the governed. Popular support for the aforementioned values has been relatively consistent throughout the 232 years since Jefferson stated them. The widespread use of public opinion data since the 1980s allows for detailed measurement of fluctuations in core values. By separating political elites from the general population, we can assess whether the two groups see eye to eye on basic political truths. This insight may help in understanding why, for example, the pervasive polarization among the political class is almost completely absent in the rest of the citizenry.

Although both parties were initially successful, the extreme violence directed against its political leaders was sufficient to oust them from the political arena. Although we continue to observe formation of new political forces, the climate of insecurity created by insurgents and the State has impeded the consolidation of the opening of democracy proposed in the constitution of 1991.

We will explore the fundamentals of using the CCD camera on the 24-inch telescope to collect photons from distant celestial bodies. We will describe the process of making three-color combined images of deep-sky objects and consider what we can learn about the structure of those objects. We will also discuss how we used our own observations to determine the size of an extrasolar planet, the age and distance of a star cluster, the mass of Neptune, and the period of a variable star.

"This panel presentation will discuss student work addressing the major topics in neurogenesis research and their applications to human health. We will present studies on the genesis and growth of new neurons in the adult brain. Beyond the endogenous regulation of neurogenesis, environmental factors have an enormous impact on the growth of new neurons and their functionality. Effects of photoperiod and temperature on neurogenesis will be reported. Another topic of great interest in neuroscience has been how prescribed medications impact neurogenesis. Given that depression has been linked to low levels of adult neurogenesis, we will report results of research on how lithium, a common mood stabilizer, affects neuronal proliferation. Similarly, the results of a study completed in connection with MGH examining the effects of multiple commonly prescribed antidepressants on neurogenesis in crayfish will be discussed including the implications these findings may have for improving depression treatments.

"An estimated one million species of plants and animals inhabit our world\xe2\x80\x99s 600,000 square kilometers of coral reefs. However, 10% of these reefs have been destroyed while a predicted 60% are on the verge of collapse due to environmental and anthropogenic effects including overexploitation, coastal development, inland or marine-based pollution, and global climate change. This degradation results in the loss of habitat and the potential extinction of many species that inhabit the reef. The parrotfish is a keystone species that helps to maintain all reefs of the world via the grazing of algae and the breakdown of calcareous sediment. With growing reef degradation comes a heightened decline of parrotfish, thereby resulting in less reef maintenance and thus the potential for continued reef decline and loss of biodiversity. Low-energy Electron-induced Reactions of CF2Cl2: Implications for the Ozone Hole? Lin Zhu \xe2\x80\x9908, Neuroscience, and Samantha Skinner-Hall \xe2\x80\x9910, Chemistry '"
"The interaction between high-energy radiation and matter produces copious amounts of secondary low-energy electrons that, through inelastic collisions with molecules and atoms, produce distinct energetic species that drive a wide variety of radiation-induced reactions. Our research serves to elucidate the pivotal role that these low-energy electron-induced reactions play in high-energy radiation-induced chemical reactions in condensed matter. For example, cosmic rays produce low-energy electrons that, through interactions with CF2Cl2, produce Cl atoms that may con-tribute to the formation of the ozone hole. We conjecture that low-energy electrons also play a pivotal role in biology based on a recent claim that the cyclic variation of extra-galactic cosmic ray flux may help explain cycles of biodiversity on earth. Low-energy electron-induced reaction studies such as ours also have important implications for industry, including the cost-efficient destruction of hazardous materials and the electron-induced decomposition of feed gases used in the plasma processing of semiconductor devices. (Research supported by a Beck Fellowship.) Anxiety and Empathy (short talks) Pendleton West 116 Walking Contradictions: A Psychological Study of the Highly Sensitive Extravert'"
"A study of 64 Wellesley students investigated the relationship between the psychological constructs of extraversion and sensory-processing sensitivity. According to Eysenck\xe2\x80\x99s theory of extraversion, extraverts have an innately higher cortical arousal threshold for sensory stimuli than do introverts. However, people with high sensory-processing sensitivity, or \xe2\x80\x9chighly sensitive people,\xe2\x80\x9d are hypothesized to have a much lower cortical arousal threshold and to be easily overwhelmed by sensory stimuli than those with low sensory-processing sensitivity. How then do highly sensitive extraverts satisfy their conflicting needs for social stimulation and an escape from sensory overload? This study hypothesized that highly sensitive extraverts experience more general anxiety and are more aroused by anxiety-inducing situations than extraverts who are not highly sensitive. Discussion will focus on data collected before and after participants engaged in a potentially anxiety-arousing social interaction. Empathy towards Animals and Humans: A Study Using Video Clips Becky Salomon \xe2\x80\x9908, Psychology and English '"
"Studies suggest that although empathy towards humans and empathy towards animals are related, they are also distinct constructs. The current study explores differences between the two empathies by varying participants\xe2\x80\x99 exposure to three video clips: an emotionally arousing human-oriented clip, an emotionally arousing animal-oriented clip, and a control clip. I hypothesized that participants who viewed a poignant human clip would exhibit higher human empathy than those who viewed a poignant animal clip or the control clip. Those who watched the animal clip were expected to have the highest animal empathy. In this presentation, I will focus on theoretical elaboration and experimental results that help us to understand the two kinds of empathy and their relationship to each other. While the results did not support my hypotheses, I will discuss why this may have occurred, and propose paths for future research. Personality and Coping with Anxiety Alexa Fong \xe2\x80\x9908, Psychology and Anthropology '"
"Are there differences in the ways that extraverts and introverts cope with state anxiety? One strategy is the implementation of mindfulness, the awareness of emotions, behavior and experiences in a non-judgmental manner. This awareness is presented through paying attention, on purpose, to the present moment. While it is possible for mindfulness to be a part of innate personality, mindfulness may also be identified as a learned skill. Wellesley College students completed tests to measure mindfulness, extraversion, neuroticism, and anxiety, in addition to participating in a mindfulness exercise (mindful meditation). Results indicated that students who scored higher on extra-version had higher mindfulness scores as well as lower initial state anxiety scores in comparison to the introvert group. Results suggest that the change in anxiety was a function of extraversion. This study illustrates that the use of mindfulness exercises to reduce anxiety appears optimistic and confirms the interest in clinical programs such as Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction. Role of Steroid Receptor Coactivator-2 (SRC-2) in Estrogen and Progestin Action DaEun (Dana) Im \xe2\x80\x9910, Neuroscience and Women\xe2\x80\x99s Studies, and Mackensie Yore \xe2\x80\x9908, Biological Chemistry '"
"Estradiol (E) and progesterone (P) act in the brain to profoundly influence a variety of events, including cognition and reproductive behavior. These hormones carry out their physiologic effects by binding to their receptors, the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progestin receptor (PR), each of which is expressed as two distinct isoforms. Previous research has shown that coactivators, including Steroid Receptor Coactivator-2 (SRC-2), physically interact with ER and PR to facilitate transcription of target genes. In this study, pull-down assays were performed to determine if SRC-2 from rat brain interacts with the isoforms of ER and PR under various ligand conditions. Results show preferential inter-actions between SRC-2 and certain receptor isoforms, indicating that the receptor isoforms have different functions in brain. These findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of how hormones function in brain to regulate hormone-dependent gene expression and behavior.

"The immune system operates mainly through T cells and B cells to fight off foreign invaders, called antigens, that gain access to the body. T cells originate in the bone marrow as stem cells and migrate to the thymus, where they differentiate into different types of T cells. They then leave the thymus as na\xc3\xafve T cells and circulate in the blood and secondary lymphoid organs searching for antigen presentation by professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DC). At the onset of this initial T cell-DC interaction there are three phases, each characterized with a specific T cell-DC interaction duration. In this study, we have looked at the significance of phase II, characterized by the stable interaction between T cells and DCs. (Research supported by the Proctor Summer Fund.)

"Recent reforms to the Moroccan marriage and family code, or Al-Mudawana, have given rise to new rights for Moroccan women. In an attempt to spread awareness about these new privileges and protections, Moroccan nongovernmental organizations have undertaken a new public-education campaign. This study, performed in the rural, central Moroccan town of Boujaad, examines the workings of these classes and the women who have come to them. In these classes, not only pedagogical ends are being furthered: Moroccan women are coming together in solidarity to talk, share their experiences, and empower themselves as never before. Human Rights: Fact and Fantasy Rachel Behler \xe2\x80\x9910, Sociology '"
"The roles of NGOs and NPOs have become increasingly important in human-rights regulation, yet their ability to promote these standards is directly related to the capitalist market by which they are funded. Human-rights causes must strategically advertise themselves to fit the goals of the funding outlets available. Hence, the causes sponsored in the field are not necessarily indicative of the most serious breaches on the scene. Moreover, even if certain causes have funding potential, backlash and increased persecution of the repressed group must be considered. This presentation will discuss the systematic processes and ethical quandaries that arise in combating human-rights infringements within a global context of limited resources by drawing on modern-day, human-rights campaigns, successful and failed, and on personal field work to illustrate the politics of the human-rights market. Gender Quotas in Pakistan:  The Substantive Representation of Women in Politics'"
"Governments have used gender quotas to bring women into politics, which remains a largely male-dominated enterprise around the world. The belief that gender functions as a criteria for representation drives this initiative. But the question remains: Do women in politics represent other women? While gender quotas might lead to an increased presence of women in politics, these quotas do not necessarily ensure a political culture wherein women can represent other women substantively. In Pakistan, the government has reserved a substantial percentage of seats for women in local, provincial, and national-level representative bodies. But the institutionalized culture of patriarchy in politics poses an obstacle to women elected through quotas to performing their role as representatives.

"Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England witnessed the birth of a government shockingly similar to a modern welfare state, complete with community- owned industries, food and cash handouts and administrators.

However, assistance was only extended to those whose deprivation was unavoidable \xe2\x80\x93 the aged, the sick and the widowed \xe2\x80\x93 known as the worthy poor. Those judged to be the unworthy poor, the willingly impoverished, faced harsh measures intended to create productive laborers: whippings, brandings, enslavement, forced apprenticeship, mutilation and jailing. The looming catastrophe of the rootless, destitute masses served as the crucible that forged many of our contemporary notions of poverty\xe2\x80\x99s origins and the appropriate role of the state in its citizens\xe2\x80\x99 economic affairs and daily lives.

Being Black and Mormon: Exploring How Boundaries Are Negotiated Krystal Walker \xe2\x80\x9908, Sociology '"
"Mormonism is the third fastest growing religion in the world. From a small sect founded in upstate New York in 1830, it has grown into a huge movement, with close to 13 million members. Yet for over half its history, the Church denied full membership to its Black members. Not until 1978 were African Americans allowed to participate fully in the Church. My study, based on interviews with church members in Massachusetts and New York, examines how the more than 100,000 Black Mormons negotiate their voluntary minority status. I examine how these individuals make sense of their racial and religious identities and how they interact with each other. (Research supported by an award from the Office of the Dean of the College.)

"As recent headlines have made painfully evident, the subprime crisis has taken a considerable toll on financial markets. As a result of mortgage institutions\xe2\x80\x99 lax lending practices and other factors, investors appear to have underestimated the risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities (MBS). In a short period of time, risk was repriced across the board and liquidity for mortgage-backed securities dried up as they lost their appeal for investors. Like many other financial crises such as bank runs, currency crises, and debt crises, the subprime meltdown can be analyzed using a global-games framework where the con-sequences of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s actions depends on what others do. In my presentation, I will be looking into how recent advances in models of global games with heterogeneous information and investment complementarities can help us explain investors\xe2\x80\x99 behavior during the subprime meltdown.

"American law, originally adapted from English common law, has evolved to meet the unique and changing needs of American society. A topic of recent debate among economists is the importance of a country\xe2\x80\x99s legal origins for its subsequent financial development and economic growth. In 1822, the New York legislature copied French civil law when it introduced a new business form, the limited partner-ship, into the United States.

The Effects of Hosting the Summer Olympics on Housing Markets SuiLin Yap \xe2\x80\x9908, Economics '"
"Countries spend millions of dollars to bid for the Summer Olympics and billions more to host the Games in hope of economic benefits, urban revitalization, and global prestige. Housing booms occurred in most Summer Olympics\xe2\x80\x99 host cities after they won the bid. Post-Olympics house prices continued to soar in some cities but flattened in others. These trends raise concerns about housing affordability, infrastructure\xe2\x80\x99s importance for housing markets, and agglomeration effects from global recognition as leading cities. Since the winning host city is announced six to seven years prior to the Summer Olympics, the announcement and the Games can be treated as natural experiments to investigate the economic impact of the Summer Olympics. This thesis studies the effects of hosting the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (1984), Atlanta (1996) and Sydney (2000) on cities\xe2\x80\x99 house prices. I also hope to identify potential implications for Beijing (2008) and London\xe2\x80\x99s (2012) housing markets. The Impact of Capital Account Liberalization on the Onset of Banking Crises in Emerging Markets Maggie Settli \xe2\x80\x9908, Economics '"
"Banking crises occur when the ability of the banks in a country to lend is impaired because their capital is exhausted by failing loans. Such crises have become increasingly common in emerging markets. In fact, some researchers claim that external financial shocks impose the largest costs to emerging market economies, even more than conflict and wars. Because these crises are extremely costly, preventing them should be a top priority for public-policy makers. The major issue that stalls attempts to prevent banking crises from occurring is the lack of general consensus as to what triggers them. My thesis explores one potential link, the relation-ship between banking crises and capital controls. I analyze whether or not capital account liberalization, or simply put, the opening up to capital flows over time, has an impact on the onset of a banking crisis in emerging markets.

"We live in a primarily visual world where so much of what we learn about sex, sexuality, and sexual health is visual. In order to help them become integrated into our visual world, those who interact with the visually impaired must explicitly describe in detail that which they cannot see.

"The Brahms C Minor Piano Quartet was completed in 1875 after having been started nearly 20 years earlier in the key of C# minor.

"Franz Schubert\xe2\x80\x99s Piano Trio no.1 op.99 in B-flat Major (1827) is a masterful work for the violin-cello-piano medium. Schubert first wrote for the piano trio in 1812 with a one-movement Piano Trio in B-flat D.28, \xe2\x80\x9cSonata\xe2\x80\x9d. Fifteen years later he returned to the medium, producing two landmark piano trios. The B-flat Trio was never per-formed publicly nor published during Schubert\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime, although privately per-formed in Vienna in 1827. The substantial first movement has an airy piano-strings texture. The soaring patterns in the exposition are varied throughout the movement, ending with an inverted first theme in the coda. The second movement is a lyrical stream of melodic simplicity. This inspired movement\xe2\x80\x99s well-balanced structure is enhanced by unanticipated harmony changes. The energetic scherzo has a strong melodic motive in the piano. The finale, listed as Rondo but written in sonata form, is metrically surprising and references popular Viennese music.

Today\xe2\x80\x99s playwrights continue this tradition while investigating Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s rapidly changing, increasingly global society. In my project I analyze plays from the Irish Renaissance alongside the reactions of contemporary playwrights to Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s recent history. I explore the ways the playwrights choose to represent moments in Irish history, as well as the ways their characters shape their personal history through methods of storytelling. In these plays, establishing a new version of the past is a key step in the creation of a personal or cultural identity. (Research supported by a Pamela Daniels \xe2\x80\x9959 Fellowship.) The Savage Wars of Peace: Using Literature to Evaluate the Decline and Fall of Empires'"
"Imperial holdings occupy a unique place in the social and literary consciousness of the colonial metropole, even when the metropole\xe2\x80\x99s claim to those colonies begins to falter. In examining the relationship between the French Empire and their \xe2\x80\x9ccrown jewel\xe2\x80\x9d colony \xe2\x80\x93 Algeria \xe2\x80\x93 and the analogous relationship between the British Empire and India, I hope to address several questions. How does the way in which colonial powers perceive and under-stand the colonized influence the eventual (and inevitable) nationalist movements within those colonies? What importance may be ascribed to preexisting national identities in these conflicts? In this talk, I will use sources drawn from history, political theory, and literature to explore the relationship between national identity, violence (or nonviolence) in independence movements, and the process of decolonization. Contemporary Northern Irish  Art and Territory: Looking Beyond a Terrible Beauty'"
"The imagery documenting the Northern Irish ethnic conflict termed \xe2\x80\x9cThe Troubles\xe2\x80\x9d has been dominated by an iconography of struggle, pain, and destruction, and by a simple sectarian divide, as shaped by the media lens. In contrast to mass-media reportage, contemporary artists from Northern Ireland seek to reveal the diversity of discourses. By critically examining the historical construction of physical territory in the Irish and Northern Irish traditions, artists excavate complex narratives which have been buried by official accounts of the conflict. Works by artists such as Paul Seawright, Victor Sloan, and Willie Doherty describe a world which goes beyond the sensationalism of the media, a two-sided oversimplification of the conflict, and their own inherited sectarian prejudices, and which delves into issues of identity, marginalization of unofficial discourse, and personal and communal experience. My thesis examines their photographic projects.

"Inspired by the controversy surrounding Israel\xe2\x80\x99s separation wall, my thesis will focus on the origins of Vladimir Jabotinsky\xe2\x80\x99s theory of separation and the theory\xe2\x80\x99s role in Israel\xe2\x80\x99s greater historical legacy. I will explore whether there exists a theoretical link between contemporary separation policies and Jabotinsky\xe2\x80\x99s theory or whether these policies are a product only of security needs. I will use the statements and writings of various leaders, as well as the policies they instituted, to assess the theory\xe2\x80\x99s influence. Historically, separation has provided an ideological framework for many of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s dealings with the Palestinian population; under-standing this history is significant as it allows for the clarification of a tumultuous ideological past and new insight into the battle for peace in the state of Israel and the occupied territories. The Dilemma of Peasant Politics: A Nepali Narrative Erisha Suwal \xe2\x80\x9908, Economics and South Asian Studies '"
"Many Nepali peasants supported the decade-long Maoists\xe2\x80\x99 Peoples War. Today, both the Peoples War and the autocratic rule of the King have ended. Maoists are being rehabilitated; Nepal moves towards Constituent Assembly elections. But were the peasants ever revolutionary? A revolutionary peasant, according to the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists), will have both the political consciousness and the organizational ability to seize state power. However, many Nepali peasants were up in arms, not to seize state power, but to secure their land rights. Further, revolutionary politics in Nepal today includes nonparty agents as well as political parties. Peasants were mobilized by the dynamic involvement of NGOs advocating for land rights on behalf of the peasants. With the help of these NGOs, Nepali peas-ants organized themselves into a nation-wide network demanding their rights and land reform. As peasants gain political consciousness they do so to claim their rights, not necessarily to overthrow the state. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship.) Paris as Ideological Battleground:  The Third Republic, the Commune,  and Competing Visions of Modernity'"
"During the Paris Commune of 1871, the last in a series of radical uprisings that defined the nineteenth century in France, Paris became both a literal and figurative battleground of competing visions of modernity. The bloody conflict between the Third Republic\xe2\x80\x99s moderate republicans and the insurgent Commune\xe2\x80\x99s radical republicans would decide more than the command of the city; the outcome would determine France\xe2\x80\x99s future as a republican nation. To the Commune\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csocialist democrats,\xe2\x80\x9d the city represented the forefront of worldwide social regeneration and their Paris reflected this identity both physically and socially. When the Third Republic ultimately triumphed, the moderates undertook the conversion of France to republicanism and the sanitization of Paris\xe2\x80\x99s revolutionary past. In my presentation, based on my senior thesis, I will explore the ideological struggle for Paris as well as relationships between political ide-ology, urban space, and national identity.

Dealing with Stress: Lessons from Cyanobacteria (panel) Science Center 277 Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria of ecological and evolutionary importance, as they cause toxic blooms in polluted waters and maintain the earth\xe2\x80\x99s oxygen atmosphere. Since they have evolved over 3.5 billion years, these microorganisms have adapted to multiple sources of stress. This panel will discuss what we can learn from cyanobacterial stress responses.

"The goal of this research is to study the acid-stress response of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. To study the acid-stress response, stationary-phase proteins, produced as a response to acid-stress conditions at pH 6.2, were harvested through lyophilization and BPER extraction. One- and two-dimensional electrophoresis techniques were employed to accomplish proteomic analysis of the proteins extracted. 1-D electrophoresis separates proteins by molecular weight while 2-D separates by molecular weight and charge. The differences in proteins expressed between acid-stressed and non-acid-stressed cells observed from these studies, as well as those of previous students, have revealed the variation of gene expression at the protein level found under acid-stress conditions. Further isolation, comparison, and identification of stationary-phase acid-stressed proteins are underway.

"Cyanobacteria are alkalophilic and raise the pH of their environment when placed in acidic media via several postulated means, including amino-acid decarboxylation. Amino-acid decarboxylases are enzymes that catalyze the reaction in which a carboxyl group is removed from amino acids. Secretion of the resulting basic amine raises the pH of the environment. Previous results showed increased decarboxylase activity in acid-stressed cyanobacteria. Western Blot analysis of decarboxylase synthesis is being used to determine whether synthesis of amino-acid decarboxylases is part of the acid-stress response of cyanobacteria. Current data have shown increased decarboxylase synthesis in cyanobacteria acid-stressed for three different time periods, suggesting that amino-acid decarboxylation is involved in the acid-stress response of cyanobacteria. (Research supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.) The Acid-stress Response in Cyanobacteria: Raising the External pH'"
"When acid-stressed at a pH of 4.0 or above, cultures of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 are observed to raise the pH of their medium. The increase in pH appears to be density dependent when cells are stressed below a pH 6 \xe2\x80\x93 denser cultures demonstrate a greater increase in pH than less dense ones. Cells grown in non-acid-stress conditions also demonstrate an increase in external pH over time, but the increase is not density dependent. It is hypothesized that acid-stressed cyanobacteria excrete something into their environment, raising the pH. Ammonia was selected as a possible candidate for excretion since ammonium is readily avail-able in the cell, thanks to its role in nitrogen assimilation. Ammonium development over time in acid-stressed cultures was found, but never in a culture that survived the acid stress. It is possible that ammonium measured in these cultures came from lysed cells and not active excretion. (Research supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.) Investigating the Role of Sodium/Proton Antiporters in Acid-stressed Cyanobacteria Using 31P NMR Spectroscopy'"
"At least five antiporter genes involved in active transport have been identified for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a strain of cyanobacteria often used in scientific research. Studies suggest that sodium/proton antiporters play a role in regulating internal and external pH in acid-stressed cells. To study this hypothesis, the internal pH of cells grown under ideal and acid-stressed conditions was determined through analysis of Pi chemical shifts using 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Living cells were studied in 20mm NMR tubes, where light and 5% CO2 in air were provided, mirroring normal growth conditions; confocal microscopy showed cell viability. Future studies will focus on generating high-resolution spectra as well as using 23Na NMR spectroscopy to ascertain the role of the sodium/proton antiporters in a cell\xe2\x80\x99s ability to maintain its internal pH.

"The cyanbacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 has developed methods of optimizing growth in its environment. As photosynthesizers dependent upon light, Synechocystis 6803 cells have been shown to move relative to a light source. Cyanobacterial type IV pili appendages have been shown to drive bacterial movement toward or away from light as positive or negative phototaxis functions in motility and surface adherence. Cells were plated on mineral medium agar and were exposed to a unidirectional white light source to determine if phototaxis could be induced in Synechocystis 6803. The presence of type IV pili in Synechocystis 6803 cells exhibiting phototaxis was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and growth in plates.

Dormancy as a Bacterial Strategy: Challenging the Cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. with Ampicillin to Investigate and Characterize a Possible Dormant State '"
"Stressed bacterial populations face a critical choice between either proliferating and risking death, or suppressing growth to protect themselves until conditions are conducive to development. Bacterial per-sister cells and viable but nonculturable (VBNC) cells display the latter phenomenon. Cell dormancy, however, has not been investigated in cyanobacteria, and the objective of my research is to describe a potential dormant state in the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6308 challenged with ampicillin. Data indicate that ampicillin at concentrations of 160\xce\xbcg/mL and 800\xce\xbcg/mL is effective at lysing Synechocystis cells at log and stationary phases, respectively. Moreover, penicillinase at similar concentrations can induce cell recovery of cultures. These data will be used to determine the ability of cyanobacteria to grow and divide after being stressed with antibiotics before they are placed in new media.

"Sometimes vivid, sometimes elusive, sometimes misleading \xe2\x80\x93 for better or for worse, our memories make up part of who we are. Some events can be recalled deliberately, whereas others may influence our behavior without conscious recollection. These two types of memorial effects are examples of explicit and implicit memory, respectively. My thesis research focuses on a specific type of implicit memory called priming. Priming is the result of prior experience with task stimuli, and can affect task performance even when the rememberer cannot consciously recall having previously encountered the stimuli. My project seeks to determine if priming is beneficial or costly (or both) to our implicit memory processing. (Research supported by funds from the Class of 1966 Associate Professorship.) Thinking with Our Hands: The Role of Gesture in Word Retrieval Ma\xc5\xa1a \xc4\x90ikanovi\xc2\xb4c \xe2\x80\x9910, Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences '"
"Research has suggested that gesture may play a role in word retrieval. However, the findings are mixed \xe2\x80\x93 some studies show that gestures offer an alternative path to the lexicon (Butterworth & Hadar, 1989; Rauscher et al, 1996), while others find no relationship between gesture and lexical access (Goldin-Meadow, 2003). Yet all suffer from methodological issues that limit their interpretation. In this study, we examined the relationship between gesture and lexical retrieval by looking at tip-of-the-tongue states (ToT). We conducted a picture-naming task, during which participants were asked to name pictures likely to induce a ToT state. We allowed one group of participants to gesture,  and we inhibited the gestures of another group. Using Gollan & Accenas\xe2\x80\x99 (2006) stringent ToT coding scheme to isolate only those ToTs that are true retrieval failures, we anticipate that participants in the gesture-inhibited condition will not have more ToTs. Spatial Language and Cognition in Deaf Signers in Nicaragua and the United States Annemarie Kocab \xe2\x80\x9910, Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences '"
"Learners of an emerging sign language in Nicaragua present a rare opportunity to study the relationship between spatial language and cognition. In this unique linguistic community, the children have rapidly added the linguistic means to encode spatial relationships, while the adults have yet to acquire such language. This creates an inverted community where adults have more experience with how objects are spatially related than children do, but have less understanding of spatial language. This study examined whether mental rotation skills of the Deaf Nicaraguan signers correlated with their mastery of spatial language. We examined older signers, younger signers, and a comparison group of 11 American Sign Language (ASL) signers. We found that younger Nicaraguan signers outperformed the older ones, and their performance correlated with their spatial language. Further, their mental rotation skills did not significantly differ from ASL signers. Thus, language seems to play an important role in spatial cognition.

"Our work focuses on a new class of bacterial cyclic nucleotide-gated (bCNG) ion channels that will provide insight into ligand gating in higher organisms. Eukaryotic ion channels analogous to bCNG ion channels play an important role in such physiological processes as sight, smell, and cardiac function. Past computer modeling studies predicted the structure of bCNG ion channels. We are looking to verify this predicted topology using biochemical techniques. By converting specific amino acids to cysteine, we induced mutations in our channel. We then used a reagent that would only react with cysteine residues outside of the cell membrane. Any reagent attached to cysteine was visualized by Western blot using a luminescent detection reagent. We successfully made these mutations in E. coli, an easily manipulated species. Mapping the topology of the membrane protein will aid in future studies focusing on the channel.

"Buforin II (BF2) is a twenty-one amino acid polycationic antimicrobial peptide that is believed to translocate into cells and bind to nucleic acids without causing membrane permeabilization. The sole proline residue of BF2 has been shown to form a disruption in the peptide\xe2\x80\x99s \xce\xb1-helical structure and to be important to translocation. We have investigated a series of BF2 variants that alter the position of its proline by one residue or one helical turn. To elucidate the mechanism by which wild type BF2 and these variants interact with and enter cells, the interactions of buforin II with lipid vesicles of varying compositions of were examined. Fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism measurements were utilized to determine the membrane affinity and secondary structure of buforin II. We have also measured the translocation ability of the BF2 variants into lipid vesicles using an ELISA-based assay with biotin-labeled peptides.

La Vie in Silico: Molecular Dynamic Simulations of Bacterial Ion Channels'"
"Bacterial cyclic nucleotide-gated (bCNG) ion channels are a recently identified family of channels gated by cyclic nucleotide ligands and potentially by voltage and mechanical stress. Models of the bCNG channel from Synechocytis sp. have been refined in this study through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that analyzed stability of the channel and its domains along with response to gating stimulus. The stability of different structures of the controversial C-terminal domain of the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) in M. tuberculosis at physiological pH was also investigated using MD simulations. Altogether, these simulations offer insight on structure-function relationships in bacterial ion channels and their domains. Proteomics of the Chloroplast Outer Envelope Membrane of Arabidopsis thaliana'"
"Chloroplasts, organelles found in plant and algal cells, are the sites of various biosynthetic functions such as photosynthesis, synthesis of plastid membrane components, and lipid-derived signaling molecules. Chloroplasts originated from the uptake of free-living cyanobacteria by host cells through endosymbiosis. For endosymbiosis to be successful, the invader, cyanobacteria, had to integrate itself into the host cell\xe2\x80\x99s cytosolic protein network. This integration presumably involved multiple protein-protein interactions between the host cell and the cyanobacteria. Our goal was to identify some of the proteins involved in such interactions. To accomplish this, we incubated isolated chloroplasts with concentrated and biotinylated crude protein extracts from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves and analyzed which proteins were associated with the chloroplast\xe2\x80\x99s outer surface membrane or envelope. Our results have revealed that a large number of proteins appear to bind to the outer envelope, suggesting that the chloroplast acts as a hub in the cellular network.

"Traditional classrooms are usually teacher-centered and based on Initiation-Response-Feedback (I-R-F) discourse patterns. Nontraditional classrooms tend to be more student-centered and consist of a variety of discourse patterns. However, some classrooms fall somewhere in between traditional and nontraditional models of classroom discourse.

The Struggle for Teachers\xe2\x80\x99 Rights: The Origins of Teacher Unionism in New York City'"
"New York City\xe2\x80\x99s teachers gained the right to bargain collectively in 1960 after decades of struggle. Like their counterparts in many other cities, teacher unionists in New York faced resistance from the public and from fellow educators. To many, the traditional perception of teaching as a self-less, feminine occupation was difficult to reconcile with the supposedly selfish act of unionizing. Teachers who were comfort-able with unionizing often divided themselves along gender, ethnic, and educational lines and competed with each other for power and benefits. Using archival materials and secondary sources, this presentation will trace the uniting of a diverse teaching force into a single organization and illustrate how conflicted Americans are about paying teachers good salaries, a problem that discourages many from going into the profession. The Influence of Maternal Depression on Preschoolers'"
"The preschool years are a critical time in which the interaction between social and gender development strongly impacts how young children view others and how they behave. Gender-based rules of behavior are often transmitted from parents to their children. What behaviors develop when preschoolers are raised by a depressive mother? Studies have demonstrated that children influenced by maternal depression will display more maladaptive behaviors than children without depressed mothers. However, while many studies have focused on infants and older children, few have focused on the links between maternal depression and preschoolers\xe2\x80\x99 behavior problems. My research investigated the relationship between maternal depression and the development of problem behavior in preschool-aged children, with a focus on gender differences.

That Space between Butch and  Femme: Performances of Lesbian Sexuality in Seattle'"
"Consider for a moment the ways in which you interact with your environment. Most people can agree that they tend to present and conduct themselves according to the location or situation in which they find themselves. I am curious about the ways in which this general idea applies to the ever-growing LGBT community in my hometown of Seattle. More specifically, I have studied the many ways it differs between lesbian-identified women who grew up in the Seattle area and those who grew up in presumably more conservative regions of the United States. Using the background notions of social constructionist and queer theories, sexual migration, and regulation of space, I will discuss the variety of ways in which \xe2\x80\x9cnative\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-native\xe2\x80\x9d lesbian-identified women present themselves in both LGBT and heterosexual spaces, the parameters of which include the boundaries of Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhoods and Washington State\xe2\x80\x99s above-average inclusion of the LGBT population in its protective laws. Controlling Sexuality: The Campaign against Pornography Elizabeth Diflo \xe2\x80\x9908, Neuroscience and Women\xe2\x80\x99s Studies '"
"In modern American society, pornography has been defined and regulated in ways that help sustain a particular power structure and sex hierarchy. As Gayle Rubin has outlined, the only \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d sexuality is considered to be heterosexual, missionary, marital, procreative, and loving, and any deviation from that is \xe2\x80\x9cbad sex\xe2\x80\x9d. The anti-pornography feminist movement demands the right to gender equality through the elimination of pornography, and the end to violence against women through practice of \xe2\x80\x9cproper\xe2\x80\x9d sexuality. Similarly, the state wants to create sexual order by way of laws and statutes against certain types of sexual activity as well as \xe2\x80\x9cobscenity\xe2\x80\x9d. Both crusades strive for the same thing, the regulation of obscenity/pornography, while exerting the power of sexuality to control society, and in so doing, perpetuate the sex hierarchy, and demonize anyone who deviates. Grrrls, Bois, and Everyone Else: Perceptions of Identity and the Medical Establishment in Trans Zines'"
"While some trans people protest against medical and psychological definitions of transexuality as a disorder, most rely on the medical establishment for basic health care, hormones, or surgery. Trans individuals who write zines, or self-published pamphlets, make up a radical subculture within the transgender community, further complicating their relationship with medicine. Trans zinesters often consider gender to be fluid, expressing a freedom to play with gender and a desire to subvert the gender binary. Many write about resistance to centralized authority, including medical authorities, yet others encourage their readers to seek medical care. Examining zines drawn from four major archives, I explore both the criticisms and medical needs of trans zinesters, showing how the current medical system both alienates and assists this community of self-identified radical trans persons.

Musical Creativity and Expression in Works for Solo Flute (long performance) Pendleton West 220'"
"While compositions for flute and keyboard instruments are most prevalent in the flutist\xe2\x80\x99s repertoire, solo works for the instrument offer their own unique opportunities for examining the flute\xe2\x80\x99s great potential for musical creativity and expression. In contrast to the multiple voices and harmony created by a flute together with other instruments, a flute alone can only provide a single melodic line. Both challenging and, in some ways, liberating, these solo works demand a particular clarity of musical direction and experimentation with tone color. Through the performance of pieces from the baroque through the twentieth century, we will explore the sound worlds that can be created by solo flute. \xe2\x80\x9cTelling\xe2\x80\x9d Stories (short talks, literary reading) Science Center 396 Path of a Story: Development in a Newsroom and Back to an Audience Mehroz Baig \xe2\x80\x9908, Spanish '"

While renowned for his highly allusive and frequently baroque style, Akutagawa has also been the subject of scholarly attention for his self-confessed preoccupation with \xe2\x80\x9cprose fiction without a story-like story\xe2\x80\x9d, a mode of writing that Akutagawa himself considered highly mimetic. I contend that the tension between these two modes of writing \xe2\x80\x93 one artificial and the other mimetic \xe2\x80\x93 is one that plays itself out in his stories. This project will examine a selection of critical writings and short stories spanning Akutagawa\xe2\x80\x99s career as I attempt to reconcile these two disparate literary impetuses in his work. \xe2\x80\x9cBooks Are Where Things Are Explained to You\xe2\x80\x9d: Julian Barnes and the Postmodern Problem of Truth'"
"Julian Barnes is a name that neither academics nor recreational readers are very familiar with. An author whose work ranges from essays, to short stories, to novels, Barnes is unique in that he explores postmodern concepts in his writing, while simultaneously disclaiming any attachment to theory. My thesis attends to four of his novels: Flaubert\xe2\x80\x99s Parrot, A History of the World in 10 \xc2\xbd Chapters, Talking it Over, and Love, Etc. Although the books are distinct in subject matter and style, each takes up the connections between truth and fiction, representing the complexity of these connections both thematically and formally. By examining Barnes\xe2\x80\x99s influences, contemporaries, and works, I offer a study into an intensely self-contradicting author whose work nonetheless contains consistent themes and ideas, and which is ultimately essential to the study of contemporary literature.

Identity and Violence: A Memoir'"
"Psychologists provide a number of therapies, treatments, and medications to help their patients cope with traumatic situations. Abuse, in particular, requires more than drugs, since the dignity lost cannot be replaced by the few hours of happiness medications can provide. After years of abuse, which affected every aspect of my life from friendships, school, work and family, I looked at an alternative healing method: writing. The endeavor of writing a memoir was a means to understand the writing process (editing, frustration, and writer\xe2\x80\x99s block) better, and the form by which to reevaluate my emotions.

Of Mice and Monkeys:  Brain Function (short talks) Pendleton West 116 Focal Colors in Humans and Macaque Monkeys Cleo Stoughton \xe2\x80\x9911 '"
"Imaging studies of macaque monkey have found regions in posterior inferior temporal cortex called \xe2\x80\x9cglobs\xe2\x80\x9d, several millimeters wide, that respond more strongly to color than black-and-white. Using single-unit recording, we determined that most glob cells had color tuning. For the 325 glob cells tested, the strongest color preference was red, followed by yellow, green, and blue. These four colors constitute the complete set of focal colors. (Focal colors can describe almost all other colors, e.g. orange is reddish-yellow.) This is the first demonstration of an explicit representation of focal colors in the brain; moreover, the relative proportion of neurons tuned to each of the focal colors matches the stereotyped sequence, shown by Berlin and Kay (1969), in which color names are adopted in language. These findings suggest that focal colors are a fundamental feature of the trichromatic primate brain and may underlie the universal evolution of color-naming. The Disneyland Effect: Recovery following Environmental Enrichment in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome '"
"One of the most devastating aspects of the developmental disorder Rett Syndrome is that affected girls develop typically for 6 to 18 months before entering a period of regression and losing acquired skills and language. Because of this regressive nature, the need for treatments effective after symptoms have manifested is pressing. We have found that exposure to an environment enriched with cognitive and sensory stimulation alleviates some of the motor and cognitive deficits associated with Rett in a mouse model of the disorder. Because we did not introduce the enrichment until relatively far into development, our results provide promising evidence for the effectiveness of late interventions in the disorder. Further research will examine neurochemical changes associated with the behavioral improvement following environmental enrichment. (Research supported by a Wellesley College Faculty Grant.) Investigating the Schizophrenic Model with Pre-pulse Inhibition'"
"Schizophrenia, a debilitating mental disorder, is characterized by positive symptoms (e.g. hallucinations), negative symptoms (e.g. flattened affect), and cognitive disorders (e.g. subtle memory deficits). Currently drug treatments for schizophrenia treat primarily the positive symptoms leaving the more subtle negative and cognitive symptoms largely untreated. We hypothesize that the negative and cognitive symptoms are related to malfunctions in the glutamatergic neurochemical system. We are working with mice with a genetic mutation in one enzyme in the glutamatergic system to model the symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Here we show that the mutant mice react virtually identically to controls in pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), a behavioral test to determine whether the mice can learn to dampen a response to high-decibel sounds. Other previous studies have used pre-pulse inhibition to model schizophrenic symptoms. These data do not support our original hypothesis but may indicate that symptoms resulting from the mutation may be too subtle to detect with PPI.

Uncovering a Novel Role for the Growth-Regulatory Protein TOR in the Yeast Cell-Division Cycle Lieu T. Tran \xe2\x80\x9909, Neuroscience '"
"Rapamycin is a drug with immunosuppressive and potential anticancer properties that inhibits growth of eukaryotic cells by disrupting the activity of the protein TOR. TOR plays a fundamental role in control-ling a variety of processes related to cell growth, most notably ribosome biogenesis. Although growth and division are distinct cellular processes, links between the TOR pathway and the cell-division cycle are likely to exist. Research shows that cells lacking Clb5, an important cell-cycle regulator called a cyclin, are hypersensitive to rapamycin, suggesting that TOR and Clb5 may have overlapping functions. Rapamycin treatment has been shown to cause microtubule depolymerization and nuclear-positioning defects in wild type cells. Using fluorescence microscopy, this research aims to determine if these defects explain the rapamycin hypersensitivity of Clb5 and, more broadly, to uncover a novel connection between TOR and the cell cycle.

"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer low-toxicity and high-specificity alternatives or adjuncts to conventional cancer treatment. Immunotherapy using mAbs is a promising approach to treating pancreatic cancer, which has poor prognosis and is typically unresponsive to chemotherapy or not amenable to surgery. The mAb CHO31.1 binds to a membrane glycoprotein A33 (GPA33) over-expressed by gastrointestinal tract tumors and kills pancreatic tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Part of our ongoing development of CHO31.1 as a potential immunotherapeutic is the molecular characterization of the CHO31.1 binding site (epitope) on A33 and its genetic effects on the tumor cell. The epitope recognized by CHO31.1 is determined by assessing fluorescent mAb binding to GPA33 expressed on noncancerous mammalian cells transformed with genetically engineered A33. Removal of regions within the extracellular domain of A33 should localize the CHO31.1 epitope (Research supported by Staley and Schiff Fellowships.) Brain and Behavior (poster session) Science Center Focus Investigating the Expression of Cholinergic Cells in the Striatum Region of the MeCP2-Mutant Mice Natalie Chen \xe2\x80\x9908, Neuroscience '"
"Rett syndrome is a developmental disorder that predominantly affects girls, and its phenotypes include gait ataxia, stereotyped-hand movements, emotional disturbance, and mental retardation. We speculate that alterations of the cholinergic system in the striatum regions of the brain result in an imbalance of excitatory vs. inhibitory inputs in the basal ganglia motor circuit. This imbalance leads to many of the aforementioned motor deficits, particularly stereotyped movements. In this project, I will investigate the number of cholinergic interneurons, which provide primarily inhibitory inputs, in the striatum region using MeCP2-null mice as a model for Rett syndrome. Estrogen, Enzymes, and the Female-Reproductive System Lindsay Kua \xe2\x80\x9908, Neuroscience '"
"Hormones use systems of checks and balances on each other. During the female-reproductive cycle, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus stimulates the release of estrogens (primarily estradiol) and progesterone, which feed back into this system to alter GnRH levels by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesized that these hormones modulate the expression of the natural GnRH-degrading enzyme, thimet oligopeptidase (TOP), thus regulating GnRH levels. Using immunodetection methods, we examined how ovariectomy and subsequent estradiol and/or progesterone treatment changed TOP expression in female rat and mouse brains. TOP levels in both species were highest in the hypothalamus compared to other brain regions. Estradiol-treated animals showed lower TOP expression in the hypothalamus compared to controls, indicating that estradiol may downregulate TOP expression to maintain high levels of GnRH at certain points in the reproductive cycle. Additionally, we explored the possible role of estradiol in activating TOP by phosphorylation. Cells in Reproductively Relevant Mouse Brain Regions Express Ovarian Steroid Receptors and Nuclear Receptor Coactivators Courtney Ackeifi \xe2\x80\x9910 '"
"Estradiol and progesterone act in the rodent brain to elicit changes in behaviors and physiology. Estradiol induces progesterone receptor (PR) expression in brain regions involved in female reproduction. Nuclear-receptor coactivators enhance the ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of steroid receptors, including estrogen receptors (ER) and PR. Work by our lab and others has shown that two nuclear-receptor coactivators, steroid-receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and SRC-2, are important in ER-mediated induction of PR in brain and in steroid-dependent behaviors. In order for nuclear-receptor coactivators to function in hormone-dependent transcription and behavior, the receptor and coactivator must be expressed in the same cell. Using a triple-label immunoflurescence technique, we will determine if individual PR containing cells in brain express SRC-1 and SRC-2. These experiments will further our understanding of basic mechanisms of how hormones act in the brain, and their possible role in brain disorders such as depression and Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease.

"Notch receptors are multidomain trans-membrane proteins that are important for cell-cell communication and development. The Lin-12/Notch Repeat (LNR) is a small disulfide-rich sequence of 35 residues first identified within the Notch receptor. Deregulated Notch signaling has been linked to many human diseases such as sclerosis, artereopathy, and leukemia. Functionality of this protein depends on the proper folding of the molecule. It has been shown that Ca2+ is required for LNR folding. This study will test the effect of other divalent cations during LNR folding using the first LNR from human Notch1 and compare it to that of Ca2+. The results of this study will help to elucidate the mechanism of metal binding and importance of metal type specificity during the protein-folding process.

"Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is a metalloenzyme highly expressed in the brain, testis, and pituitary glands of mammals, and is involved in the metabolism of small peptides active in the central nervous system. Previous work suggests that TOP can metabolize an unusually wide range of substrates due to the flexibility of a loop opposite the binding pocket. Therefore, we are exploring the relationship between structure and function of the enzyme by comparing the activity of wild type and mutated forms of TOP with different size substrates to determine which mutations affect its binding capacity. Specifically, we are investigating the 599-611 loop region of TOP which has been chosen because of its high glycine content, known to give an enzyme flexibility. By substituting glycine with much bigger amino acids like alanine or proline, we can pinpoint which residues are specifically involved in TOP\xe2\x80\x99s unusual flexibility. (Research supported by the AT&T (BellSouth) Mentoring in the Sciences Gift.) Metal-ion Selectivity and Affinity of the LIN-12/Notch-Repeat'"
"Notch receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins that regulate cell fate in multicellular organisms via a highly conserved signaling pathway. Three tandem LIN-12/Notch-Repeats (LNRs) are responsible for maintaining the receptor in its resting con-formation prior to ligand binding. These highly conserved LNR modules contain three characteristic disulfide bonds and a group of conserved aspartate/asparagine residues that coordinate a Ca2+ ion, which is essential for its correct folding. In this work, we used human Notch1 LNRA (hN1LNRA) as a model system to investigate the binding specificity and affinity of calcium, zinc, and terbium to an LNR using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We also compared the binding affinities of these metals for the wild type hN1LNRA to a mutant form of hN1LNRA, where the serine in position 19 is replaced by an aspartate. This work represents important steps in elucidating the basis for metal-ion selectivity by the LNRs.

Investigation of the Morphology of Alveolar Type II Pneumocytes in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome Hyon S. Kim \xe2\x80\x9908, Neuroscience '"
"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is diagnosed almost exclusively in girls and that is caused by a mutation in the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene on the X chromo-some. The phenotype of RTT includes hypotonia, apraxia, microcephaly, mental retardation and autistic-like behaviors. Respiratory abnormalities, typically exhibited as alternating episodes of hyperventilation and apnea, are also one of the most striking characteristics of RTT and considered to be the primary cause of sudden death. While the neurological contributions to the phenotype have been studied, very little is known about what is occurring at the cellular level in the lung. This study used light and electron micros-copy to characterize the morphology of alveolar type II pneumocytes in the peripheral lung of a MeCP2-knockout mouse model. A MeCP2 deficiency is thought to cause morphological changes in these cells, which may contribute to the respiratory abnormalities.

"Compared to other vertebrates, goldfish (Carassius auratus) are unique in their capacity to survive for several days without environmental oxygen. Previous data suggest that the hypoxia-induced activation of cardiac ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels may serve to increase tolerance of low oxygen, and we have characterized a nitric oxide (NO)- and cGMP-dependent signaling pathway by which this occurs. The purpose of the present study was to resolve the altered expression of genes associated with this pathway in response to hypoxia acclimation. Goldfish were exposed to moderately hypoxic conditions (2.6 mg O2/l)) for one week. Using quantitative RT-PCR, the expression of KCNJ11, a gene coding for a subunit of the KATP channel, NOS2a, (NO synthase) and HIF1a (hypoxia-inducible factor) were characterized in the hearts of acclimated vs. nonacclimated animals. Preliminary data support the hypothesis that the response to chronic hypoxia in this species involves an upregulation of KATP channels during acclimation.

"The history of twentieth-century Latin America was marked by revolution. Revolutions dramatically altered all aspects of national society including health-care systems and social services. Two such movements, the Cuban Revolution of 1959, and the military coup led by General Pinochet in Chile in 1973, provide the context for my analysis of the significant changes in health care that came about in these nations as a result of these two very different revolutions. A historically informed analysis of the socialized medical system put in place in Fidel Castro\xe2\x80\x99s Cuba and the contrasting neo-liberal, market-based system implemented by the Pinochet regime in Chile allows for a unique discussion of health care, human rights, and revolution in Latin America.

Post-Hurricane Mitch Nicaragua: The Impact of Early Childhood Malnutrition on Education Grace Logan \xe2\x80\x9908, Economics '"
"Nicaragua is a country with a long history of poverty and inequality. In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch made landfall, bringing with it flooding and winds that killed thousands, destroyed vast amounts of infrastructure, and left hundreds of thou-sands with limited access to food, water, and shelter. The resulting shock to nutrition in children in the early stages of development will have a long-term impact on their physical and cognitive development and also negatively affect school enrollment, and educational attainment. I will look at how early childhood malnutrition played a role in delayed school enrollment for those children impacted by Hurricane Mitch. The measured impacts can shed light on how important early childhood nutrition can be for advancing education in developing countries.

"Research shows that men are significantly more influential than women (Lockheed, 1985) and moreover, that men particularly resist women\xe2\x80\x99s influence (Eagly & Carli, 2007). Influence differences between males and females begin as early as preschool and like men, boys resist female influence more than male influence. Boys even resist their mothers more than girls do. An investigation of 2-6 year-olds concluded that boys listen more often to their fathers than their mothers, but girls are equally influenced by both parents (Power, McGrath, Hughes, & Manire, 1994). However, this phenomenon may be culture bound. Evidence suggests that women are viewed as more agentic in the African American community than among Caucasians, suggesting that African American boys may be equally influenced by both males and females (Kane, 1992). To test this hypothesis, in this study I assessed how influential male and female puppets were when interacting with African American and Caucasian preschoolers.

"The current study will examine the relationship between eating attitudes and two of its potential risk factors, level of voice and internalization of the superwoman ideal, in over 150 seventh- and eighth-grade students. Previous research has found that unhealthy eating attitudes and behaviors predict eating disorders in adolescents. It is expected that low levels of voice, defined as the difficulty one has in expressing his/her thoughts, feelings, and needs in relationships, will positively correlate with unhealthy eating attitudes and depression. We also expect to find a correlation between unhealthy eating attitudes and internalization of the superwoman ideal, defined as an unachievable internalization of both masculine and feminine characteristics.

"France in the mid-nineteenth century was plagued with an identity crisis.

Within this context of political and social upheaval, Eug\xc3\xa8ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879) emerged as both a celebrated architect, and as a welcome voice of national pride and values. Viollet-le-Duc\xe2\x80\x99s restoration of Notre Dame de Paris (1845) was part of a larger movement to preserve the rapidly disappearing structural remains of Gothic culture in France.

"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder which is the second leading cause of mental retardation in girls, and for which there is no cure. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to non-invasively investigate the brain chemistry in a mouse model for RTT. We calculate the metabolite concentration ratios choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) and N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) by integrating the corresponding peaks of the MR spectra obtained on post-natal days 21/22, 35/36 and 42/43. Preliminary data suggest that postnatal day 35/36 is an important time in development, because at that point the Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr ratios are lower in females with Rett syndrome compared to wild-type. This information may be useful in understanding the source of the symptoms, and in future studies to determine the relative efficacy of putative treatments.

By looking at the similarities between reported interactions with imaginary companions and with real friends, I am able to draw conclusions about how children rep-resent social relationships. Additionally, by examining differences in how descriptive children are when talking about real and imaginary friends, we gain an appreciation for the function of the imaginary companion as a conversational tool.

"Second-order false-belief understanding is the understanding that people can have beliefs about the beliefs of other people. That is to say, I understand that Mia thinks that Sara thinks her dog is green. This awareness normally develops in children between the ages of six and seven. However, many language-delayed children, like those with autism, struggle with understanding these complex mental states. It is unclear however, whether their struggles result from an inability to follow the complex language of the traditional measures of second-order false-belief understanding, or from a true failure to understand this concept. Currently, there are no second-order false-belief measures that do not require complex language to administer. We have been testing the validity of several different nonverbal measures of second-order false-belief understanding with a normal adult population. If these tests are successful, we hope to modify them for use with several low-verbal populations. (Research supported by a Sophomore Early Research stipend.)

New Korean Cinema: The Surge  of Hanryu Hits South Korea  (interactive teaching presentation) Collins Cinema'"
"Recently, there has been a great amount of interest given to New Korean Cinema. To name just a few, directors like Sang-soo Hong, Ki-duk Kim, Chan-Wook Park, Chang Dong Lee, and Joon-ho Bong have recently made famous/infamous films that made South Korea a noticeable rookie in the film world. We will focus on three films: Oasis (directed by Chang Dong Lee), Tale of Two Sisters (directed by Ji-woon Kim), and I\xe2\x80\x99m a Cyborg, But That\xe2\x80\x99s OK (directed by Chan-Wook Park).

"Immediately dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lunatic Express\xe2\x80\x9d by critics in the British Parliament, the Uganda Railway never promised much by way of development; on the contrary, its main purpose was to beat the Germans to effective occupation of Uganda and (supposedly) protect the Suez Canal through control of the Upper Nile. However, the \xc2\xa35,502,592 bill forced the British to find a way to make the railway profitable, leading to the formulation and implementation of technocratic visions aimed at molding East Africa into a self-sufficient satellite of the British Empire. The results, of course, were mixed. This presentation discusses the complex ways in which the Uganda Railway transformed social, political, and economic life in Kenya and Uganda.

"The partition of India and Pakistan did not begin on August 15, 1947, but as an idea early in the twentieth century and continues as a reality today. By examining the context of religious revivalism both as an invented identity of colonization and as an inherent ideal for religious groups in India, I will discuss the narratives of many Punjabi Hindu Nationalists who migrated to India from what is now Pakistan. Hindu Nationalists debated with members of the Muslim League and other groups over how to make the nation truly independent, discussing issues such as representation in the new government and choosing a national language. Furthermore, Partition caused rifts not only on communal or sectarian lines, but also along regional and ideological lines. Thus my work illustrates the trajectory of partition from invented British colonial definitions of identity to the way these identities were internalized and continued after Independence.

"A comparative study of Irish and Indian nationalism in the late-colonial era reveals a number of similar themes and obstacles in the elite formations of national identity. Visions for a postcolonial nation were often divided between a religious, ethnic interpretation of national identity and the lure of a more modern, often socialist overthrow of Empire. Not mere products of cultural coincidence, intellectual elites of Ireland and India often found themselves in London. Through movements such as Labour, Theosophy, and modernist literature, the anticolonial nationalist dialectic was played out within the cultural bounds of the city. Intellectual currents interacted with Indian and Irish expatriate populations to construct a political narrative that was aware of, yet distinct from, corresponding anticolonial movements within India and Ireland themselves, and attached instead to the metropole of the Empire.

"Color arises from a network that begins with the cones and progresses through stages of processing involving cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), primary visual cortex (V1), and prestriate areas. Representation of color along the red-green axis is derived from an opponent process whereby responses from medium-wave-length (M) cones are subtracted from those of long-wavelength-selective (L) cones, leading to Type I L/M cells in the LGN. Color contrast arises through double-opponent receptive fields defined by spatial and color opponency in both center and surround. Recent physiological studies have identified such double-opponent receptive fields in V1 and characterized them with high-resolution spatial maps. Our model considers known variations of red-green Type I cells as building blocks, defined by a difference of Gaussians and sizes of center and surround based on experimentally observed values, of physiologically characterized double-opponent cells to understand the spatiotemporal response properties of V1 neurons. Catching Balls: What Visual Cues Are Used to Judge the 3-D Trajectory of a Moving Object? Rosa-Lynne B. Fernando \xe2\x80\x9908, Neuroscience and Computer Science '"
"We created a virtual ball-catching task that simulates a fly ball launched from a central point and had human subjects predict where the ball will land. Many properties in the task were changed such as the ball\xe2\x80\x99s absolute size, its varying size throughout the trajectory, the presence of a background grid as a reference point and the percent of the flight trajectory shown to the viewer. Analysis of the viewers\xe2\x80\x99 catching paths and final landing site pre-dictions as a function of our variables helps to determine which visual cues are used to perform this task. This study also addresses the extent to which viewers predict the ball\xe2\x80\x99s flight trajectory as opposed to relying on a self-correcting tracking strategy while the ball is in flight.

Variational Monte Carlo Method Applied to Spins in 2-Dimensional Square Lattices with Zero Doping Sunita Kannan \xe2\x80\x9908, Physics and Mathematics '"
"My research involves the theoretical study of cuprates, which are compounds whose elements are sandwiched between copper oxide, square lattice plane layers. We know that when electrons are removed from these planes (through \xe2\x80\x9cdoping\xe2\x80\x9d) the electron interactions change. The specific aim of my thesis is to find the best possible model at zero doping. This involves taking a model Hamiltonian (in the form of the Extended Heisenberg Hamiltonian), deter-mining its groundstate wavefunction by the Variational Monte Carlo method (which involves testing different \xe2\x80\x9ctrial\xe2\x80\x9d wavefunctions \xe2\x80\x93 specifically the striped and the \xe2\x80\x9ccheckerboard\xe2\x80\x9d wavefunctions), then using this groundstate wavefunction to determine the magnetization predicted by that model. By comparing this magnetization with experimental results, I can find the most suitable model. Using that model, we can find the way the electrons interact with one another in that particular state because, at its core, the Hamiltonian essentially encapsulates the way the electrons interact.

"As sustainability becomes a common buzzword, it is important for our community to back up this word with actions that work. Food is critical, and indeed is one of the areas requiring the most change, as food production has a long history of not always providing for the needs of the population. In order to create a more self-sustaining community, we must reconstruct how food is eaten, produced, transported, and ultimately, grown. At Wellesley, we have started a farm that uses sustainable techniques. With the formation of this farm, we have begun to build relationships with Dining Services and El Table Cooperative Cafe. Our presentation will include a history of the Wellesley College farm project, as well as more general information about the sustainable food movement. This presentation is recommended to anyone interested in learning how to make healthy food choices for themselves and their com-munity at large. Philosophy and the Construction of Knowledge (short talks) Science Center 277 The Role of Status Anxiety and Emotion in Intellectual Conflict: The Case of Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin Sanja Jagesic \xe2\x80\x9908, Sociology and German Language and Literature '"
"Intellectuals as a group are defined, and define themselves as rational, disinterested, truth-seeking individuals. As a result of these characteristics being ascribed to intellectuals, they occupy a privileged space in society. Because of their presumed disinterest, their ideas are often accepted as the most correct, as uncorrupted by the need for financial and other forms of gain. However, studies of interactions among intellectuals reveal that they cannot simply be defined as disinterested and purely rational. Instead, it is evident that factors such as nonrational emotional arguments and status anxiety play a significant role in the work of intellectuals. In my presentation, I analyze these factors by looking at the case of intellectual rivalry between the nineteenth-century radical theorists Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin. This research is based on a qualitative content analysis of the theoretical writings and letters by each theorist. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship.)

"Jos\xc3\xa9 Vasconcelos was a writer, a philosopher, an educator, and a politician. He was one of the more influential intellectuals in M\xc3\xa9xico\xe2\x80\x99s early history. In La Raza C\xc3\xb3smica The Cosmic Race, published in 1925, Vasconcelos envisioned that the Americas would produce a hybrid or \xe2\x80\x9ccosmic\xe2\x80\x9d race that would generate a new era of humanity. This new era would be based on the joy and love of knowledge and not on skin color, ethnicity, or convenience. Vasconcelos\xe2\x80\x99 work has often been read as a racist text. I propose an alternative reading, one which understands race within the debates intellectuals like Vasconcelos took part in the early twentieth century. I argue that Raza then was understood in spiritual and cultural terms rather than biological ones. The controversies that have surrounded Vasconcelos\xe2\x80\x99s writings are due in great part to this misinterpretation. I propose further that in order to more fully understand Vasconcelos\xe2\x80\x99 theories one must look at his intellectual development historically and consider, among other things, his growing up during El Porfiriato, the impact of positivism and of the Mexican Revolution in his thinking as well as his appointment as the first Secretary of Education in 1921. It is only in this historical context that one can better understand Vasconcelos\xe2\x80\x99 idea about the Cosmic Race.'"
"Japan\xe2\x80\x99s all-female Takarazuka Revue has been staging large-scale musicals to mostly female audiences for almost 100 years.

However, are these representations static? Changes in the Takarazuka repertoire over the past 15 years could be a reflection of a greater redefining of gender roles in Japanese society as a whole.

"Suppose a diner asks, \xe2\x80\x9cCan you pass the salt?\xe2\x80\x9d Although her utterance is literally a question (about the physical abilities of the addressee), most would take it as a request (that the addressee pass the salt).

C\xc3\xa9sar Franck and His Violin and Piano Sonata (long performance) Pendleton West 220'"
"The nineteenth-century Romantic Era is characterized by its passionate and expressive nature, and its unlimited imaginative and fantastical possibilities. In Belgium, a dominant force in music at this era was C\xc3\xa9sar Franck (1822\xe2\x80\x931890). Over his life-time, Franck\xe2\x80\x99s compositions included operas, symphonies, organ works, and the Violin and Piano Sonata in A major, being among Franck\xe2\x80\x99s best-known compositions. The term \xe2\x80\x9csonata\xe2\x80\x9d, in Latin literally means a piece to be played as opposed to being sung. Sonatas of the Romantic period retained the musical form of the Classical Sonatas, but emphasized the emotional possibilities that were never achieved before. Franck\xe2\x80\x99s Sonata in A major (1886) is a perfect example of this sonata of the Romantic period. Franck uses the cyclic form in which same musical themes are developed throughout the piece, resulting in a unity among the four movements. Art, Feminism, and the Home: Domesticity Reexamined (exhibition) Jewett Art Center, Student Gallery'"
"My independent studies in printmaking this year have explored issues of feminist art. Throughout the year, I have been considering the concept of home and belonging by viewing objects through a feminist lens. I wanted to explore and present these ideas using different visual formats, including handmade books, prints, sewing, and performance. Along the way, I have become particularly interested in traditionally feminine objects associated with the home: aprons, spools, teapots, and the like. Currently, we are seeing a kind of new domesticity, or reclaiming of domesticity emerge; motifs and styles reminiscent of those used in the 1950s and \xe2\x80\x9960s are popular once again.

"After four years of Arabic study both at Wellesley and abroad at Middlebury, in Egypt, and in Morocco, two students decided to explore Arabic literature in order to continue their progress in mastering the language. Structured around informal weekly meetings, discussions of contemporary literary works by writers from Taha Hussein to Hanan Al-Shaykh were held in Arabic, enabling students to practice the language by speaking about its literature. Using this untraditional, independent, and informal setting, students were able to focus specifically on their interests and needs in the spirit of salon-style learning without the commitment of taking a course for academic credit.

"The United States, without a doubt, has the most technologically advanced military in the world. From unmanned aerial vehicles to social networking systems, the United States uses this technology to give its military an immense advantage over its enemies. As the world seems to turn away from conventional warfare to unconventional warfare, we can examine how technology is used in asymmetrical operations and how it can contribute to the success or failure of a mission. Precision-guided munitions are only one piece of technology used by the United States military. However, by tracking the history of their use in major conflicts beginning with Gulf War I until today, we can see that doctrine is created to fit the current technology and technology is conversely adapted to fit the doctrine.

"Nanoscale science has potential for use in numerous fields such as biomaterials. Proposed biomedical applications include the creation of nanoscale thin films for the mitigation of biofouling and the development of novel nanoscale materials for drug delivery. We will present results from studies of two nanoscale biomaterial systems. The first focuses on using thin films of gold nanoparticles that have their surfaces functionalized with organic molecules. These films have been proposed as coating for medical devices and as substrates for sensing of biological molecules. Despite these interests, little is known about the stability of such films, a property we have been investigating. The second system involves pH-responsive nanoscale metal oxide particles. These hollow materials are based on molybdate (MoO42) and may have good stability in acid environments but dissolve rapidly in neutral or basic solutions. Steps toward creating and characterizing these potential drug delivery vehicles will be highlighted. (Research supported by the Brachman Hoffman Fund and Wellesley College.)

The Growing, Learning Brain  (short talks) Pendleton West 116 Modeling Adult Neurogenesis'"
"Like humans and many other species, crayfish produce new neurons throughout their entire lives. The goal of this research is to build a computational model of the crustacean neurogenic system using MATLAB. This model is not only a descriptive summary that helps to unite and consolidate previous findings, but it also functions as a predictive tool, allowing for a better understanding of how possible modifications and treatments influence neural proliferation at the systems level. The existence of a simulation built solely on quantitative analyses also allows us to test the accuracy of our current under-standing of this system and may lead us to pose new experimental questions that have not been previously considered. Sexual Dimorphism in Brain  Serotonin Levels in Crustaceans Zehra Omer \xe2\x80\x9910, Neuroscience and Middle Eastern Studies '"
"The neurohormone serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine) has both behavioral and developmental effects in crustaceans, including regulation of the molt cycle and the rate of neurogenesis. Preliminary experiments in crayfish suggested that brain serotonin levels may differ in a systematic way between males and females. This project aims to compare brain serotonin levels in American lobsters, Homarus americanus, where we use the brains of sibling male and female adults to quantify serotonin levels using HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) methods. We examine whether the differences in serotonin levels are correlated with the gender or size of the animal, as measured by carapace length. This work also raises the question of how any differences in serotonin levels may be related to the development and overall functioning of the organism. Do I Know You?: Determining How the Brain Processes Xiaoyue Guo \xe2\x80\x9911, Neuroscience '"
"We can immediately pick out one face among a sea of faces, but this seemingly effortless ability involves complex mechanisms of object recognition. One accepted theory of facial representation describes a \xe2\x80\x9cface-space\xe2\x80\x9d where faces are points in a Cartesian space; multiple dimensions represent the varying ways to distinguish faces (e.g. by gender, age). Inverted faces, being especially difficult to recognize, are proposed to not be represented in this perceptual space. This summer, I used a contrast-based adaptation paradigm to measure human subjects\xe2\x80\x99 abilities to discriminate images of inverted or upright faces (test) after adapting to a face in either orientation (adaptor). By varying the contrast, and thus difficulty, of test faces, I could see which adaptors facilitated or harmed test-face recognition. Surprisingly, upright adaptors affected the recognition of inverted tests, but not vice-versa. This asymmetry in adaptation transfer suggests that separate neuronal populations code each orientation, but have some one-way interaction. (Research supported by a CIHR Summer Studentship.) What Do Babies Know?'"
"Babies can draw rich inferences even after a brief experience with a single object. For example, upon learning that a toy has a squeaking property, infants can infer that a similar looking toy also squeaks. They accurately generalize that object property even if only small amounts of data are available. But what makes their inferences so accurate? Studies have shown that infants as young as eight months can tell the difference between random and non-random samples of a population of toys, showing a powerful capacity for inductive learning. The present study explores how infants\xe2\x80\x99 sensitivity to statistical properties of a sample may constrain inductive inferences, thereby increasing the accuracy of their generalizations. The results show that infants between 13 and 18 months learn what they see, and they generalize what they learn. However, when given information that is inconsistent with their intuitive statistical inferences, they resist generalizing that knowledge.

"As a white activist, I have identified an existing tension in the realm of working for racial equality. As a woman who grew up with a tremendous amount of privilege I have worked to find my role in a struggle that centers on empowerment. I have witnessed the empowering effect of the hip-hop movement and have studied both the roots of this movement and the role white women rappers have played. While observing the power of this movement, I also recognize the conflicts in my relation-ship with this movement and the conflicts of all white women who choose to participate and perform within hip-hop.

"The imaging of Asian Americans has been transformed and recycled throughout American television and film history.

"Critics of heavy metal music have described its images of violence and transgression as enacting a misogynistic hypermasculinity predicated upon the objectification and violation of women. Traditional scholarly analyses presuppose that women listening to heavy metal music will identify with the sexualized images of women encoded in the lyrics and that they will passively internalize and perform this construction of femininity. I, however, contend that by choosing to identify with the active, transgressive figure embodied in the implicitly-masculine narrators of heavy metal songs, women can construct a subcultural identity that subverts main-stream constructions of femininity.

"America was founded by immigrants, and now a whole new wave of their children is coming of age. Many scholars have studied first generation immigrants, but what about their children? This is an important population to examine, particularly right now. This modern second generation accounts for one out of every six 18\xe2\x80\x9332 year olds in the United States. This issue is particularly salient to the American Jewish community; nearly every Jew in the United States is descended from an immigrant to our shores and most are only separated from the old country by three or four generations.

"During the earlier years of the Japanese occupation of Korea, most Koreans lived in poverty and many decided to move to Japan where they could find employment. Entering Japan was not difficult since Koreans were considered citizens of Japan; however, the most difficult part was living in Japan. Koreans were treated as second- class citizens and faced harsh discrimination within Japanese society. Towards the end of Japanese colonial rule, many Koreans in Japan repatriated to their homeland. However, approximately 600,000 Koreans decided to remain in Japan. These Koreans and their descendants came to be known as \xe2\x80\x9cZainichi\xe2\x80\x9d Koreans. Once Korea was an independent nation, first generation Zainichi Koreans lost Japanese citizenship and were given Korean citizenship. However, once the Japanese government allowed Zainichi Koreans to become naturalized citizens, many decided to naturalize. Today, many third and fourth generation Zainichi Koreans struggle between their ethnic Korean and modern Japanese identity. Does naturalization lead Zainichi Koreans to lose their Korean identity? The Theme of Exile in Maghrebi Thought from 1948 to the Present Alma Rachel Heckman \xe2\x80\x9909, French and Middle Eastern Studies '"
"To be an exile is to be uprooted from one\xe2\x80\x99s homeland. Before French colonization and until the founding of the modern state of Israel (1948), Jewish communities thrived alongside Arab ones in the Maghreb although their rapport was not always perfectly harmonious. However, most Jews fled North Africa to become exiles due to an increasingly hostile environment, which was accompanied by policies of religious exclusivity in new nation states. At the same time, Arabs, too, experienced exile both from within and geographically outside the extreme political climate of fundamentalism that characterized some of these states. In my thesis work this year, I have been exploring, through comparative study, Jewish and Arab views of exile in North African Francophone literature.  I will share my findings on the complex experience of exile through Jewish and Arab voices of the region and reflect upon an enlarged understanding of this emotive concept.

During the time, Qing authorities began incorporating the ethnically differentiated populations of Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia by applying the policies used in China\xe2\x80\x99s provinces. This was a dramatic shift from the way these areas were previously governed. What factors and changing ideas about governance within the Chinese state led to these adjustments?

"The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 changed the face of the United States airline industry, altering its competitive structure and eliciting several antitrust concerns. One key change to air travel has been the increased prevalence of low-cost carriers (LCCs) as a discount choice for passengers. In recent years, several LCCs have exited the market through bankruptcy or liquidation, citing rising fuel costs as a primary cause. Did established carriers significantly increase their airfare when competing LCCs left city-pair routes? Should there be a shift in policy to encourage a larger LCC presence in the industry? Easing the Transition to Adulthood: The Effects of Increasing the Age of Dependency for Health Insurance to 25'"
"Young adults represent the largest group of Americans who are not covered by health insurance. One third of young adults (13 million) lack health insurance, compared to 16 percent of the population as a whole. Limited access to coverage and rising costs are primary barriers facing young adults first entering the labor force from obtaining insurance. Since the early 1990s, 20 states have implemented extended dependent coverage laws, allowing unmarried young adults to be covered under a parent\xe2\x80\x99s private health insurance plan until their 25th birthday. This research examines whether these laws work as designed to increase health insurance rates among young adults. We take advantage of the cross-state variation in the timing in which these laws were introduced and examine the success of the laws by investigating their effect on health insurance rates within the target demographic group. The Effect of Falling House Prices on Labor Mobility Lindsay Relihan \xe2\x80\x9909, Economics '"
"The efficiency of the American economic system relies on the mobility of capital and labor across regions. However, labor mobility is largely dependent on the performance of the housing market; before a worker can migrate, he or she must sell a home and buy a new home. Falling house prices slow this process and, therefore, the speed with which workers obtain new employment. Using state-to-state migration data, I attempt to quantify this effect.  I expect to find that states with falling house prices experience higher unemployment as a result of restricted migration. The recent collapse of the housing market and subsequent recession will be slower to recover if this relationship holds. Migration and the Gender Wage Gap: Mexico Post-NAFTA'"
"There is much debate about how trade liberalization, a force behind globalization, affects women. One of the most important trade liberalization agreements in the decade of the nineties was the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), implemented in 1994 among the United States, Mexico, and Canada. NAFTA was expected to have a particularly significant effect on Mexico because it was gaining market access to two large, prosperous economies in the United States and Canada. Though wages and GDP increased in Mexico post-NAFTA, certain regions and industries may have benefited more than others. Similarly, certain groups in the population may have benefited more than others from these changes. NAFTA may have had differential effects on male/female wages and migration. I investigate how the gender wage gap changed during this time period and whether those changes are related to NAFTA. For example, did NAFTA change male/female mobility patterns in Mexico? Did NAFTA generate changes in job opportunities that differentially affected men and women?

"Many contend that (further) regulating pornography would be an unconstitutional infringement of the free speech right. Catharine MacKinnon argues instead that failing to (further) regulate pornography violates women\xe2\x80\x99s right to free speech. According to MacKinnon, pornography silences women by systematically interfering with women\xe2\x80\x99s ability to successfully perform certain speech acts. If this is right, then the free speech rights of pornographers directly conflicts with the free speech rights of women. Using the philosophy of language, Rae Langton and Jennifer Hornsby offer a speech act account of silencing. Alexander Bird criticizes their account.

"When new students arrive at college, they confront the campus landscape, not just its physical geography but also its less concrete yet still palpable atmosphere. Whether the student experiences a sense of belonging, a sense of rootedness, or a sense of displacement on campus, she unavoidably interacts with this geography to construct or develop a relationship with and attitude towards it. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with students at three of seven schools participating in a panel study of the class of 2010, my presentation will focus on the various ways that students come to feel \xe2\x80\x9cat home\xe2\x80\x9d and develop place identities rooted in the college environment. I will also examine the influence of students\xe2\x80\x99 personal environmental histories (i.e., those landscapes\xe2\x80\x94birthplaces and other residences, primary and secondary schools\xe2\x80\x94with which the student has already established a relationship) on their responses and attachments to the college landscape. Male Cross-registrants at a  Women\xe2\x80\x99s College: Effects on the Academic Achievement of Wellesley College Students Yo-Jud Cheng \xe2\x80\x9909, Economics '"
"The number of male cross-registrants at Wellesley has reached unprecedented levels over the past few years. During the fall 2007 semester, 11 percent of classes had at least one male student. The mission of Wellesley College is to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide an excellent liberal arts education for women,\xe2\x80\x9d but how important is the \xe2\x80\x9cfor women\xe2\x80\x9d aspect of a Wellesley education? Research suggests that the presence of male students in a classroom environment can significantly affect the interactions between students and faculty, and may even unconsciously influence the behavior of students through stereotype threat. I use an econometric framework to analyze whether or not the enrollment of a male student in a class affects the academic achievement of Wellesley students.

Urban Convents in Eighteenth Century Italy: The Case of Santa Maria Egiziaca in Bologna, 1689-1760s Liise Lehtsalu \xe2\x80\x9909, History and  Italian Studies '"
"As a small urban convent designed to house repenting prostitutes, Santa Maria Egiziaca provides an interesting case study of the dilemmas faced by many early modern convents. On the one hand, both ecclesiastical and secular authorities perceived female monastic institutions as subject to enclosure that separated them from the surrounding secular world. On the other hand, the demands of long-term financial survival and institutional continuity required convents to engage with near-by communities and encourage outside interest in convent affairs. Balancing this conflict of interests became a struggle that resulted in continuous com-promise of stated principles and open challenges to the convent identity.

"In an academically competitive atmosphere like Wellesley, does ambition contribute to a college culture of \xe2\x80\x9cstress,\xe2\x80\x9d or does our environment furnish our ambition? What are the motivations behind the majors that we choose, the activities in which we participate, and the internships that we complete?

Cross-cultural Research Cross-cultural Health Issues  (short talks) Science Center 104 Cold Showers and Tuberculosis: Ethnographic Insights from a Guatemalan TB/HIV Clinic'"
"The tuberculosis and HIV clinic of Guatemala\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital Rodolfo Robles exemplifies a holistic approach to patient care that offers lessons for medical care in the USA. My ethnographic study of the clinic while a volunteer there in 2008 suggests that the philosophy of the clinic operates on principles of Zapatista ideology: Though the stay is free, the patient is expected to perform menial tasks such as cleaning dishes, washing laundry and maintaining his or her living space. These activities train the ill to take responsibility not only for their own care, but for the healing environment itself. My participant-observations in Guatemala address the benefits of Zapatista self-sufficiency, but contextualize such benefits within the framework of a neoliberal state that has historically viewed self-sufficiency as a threat to governmental power. An understanding of such conflict is critical in highlighting the role of NGOs in the anti-politics of healthcare reform.

"Heroin addiction is a pervasive cross-regional public health problem in American society that often results in expensive hospitalizations and injury-related deaths. Heroin is a semi-synthetic opioid created from morphine that brings analgesic effects similar to the body\xe2\x80\x99s natural painkillers, but provides euphoria when used recreationally. In Boston, heroin is the primary \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d recreational drug used; therefore it is necessary to explore addiction\xe2\x80\x99s causality and the ways that heroin\xe2\x80\x99s properties and highly addictive nature contribute to addiction. Furthermore, I also address how that definition negatively influences treatment and health outcomes for users. Social suffering and marginalization from society enable them to create their own subculture that continually gives them access to social networks, gift/exchange relationships and relative economic stability. My goals are to express the shortcomings of homogenous abstinence-only treatment modules and stress how they do not adequately address the comprehensive health needs of a heterogeneous heroin-using population.

Economic Issues Trading Up  (short talks) Pendleton East 139 The New Trade Theory:  Extensions to Occupational Wage Inequality in the U.S. Andrea Liang \xe2\x80\x9909, Economics  and Mathematics '"
"Does international trade significantly affect wage inequality in the United States? Traditional trade theory says that yes, it does; however, many notable economists have written papers which have concluded that trade of the type and scale which the United States is typically engaged in has not been a major factor in the vast increase of wage inequality in the U.S. over the past three decades. These papers have chiefly focused on the effect of trade on the wages of low-skilled workers; little work has been done to determine whether burgeoning top-tier inequality has any roots in international trade. This research determines the implications of the New Trade Theory\xe2\x80\x94espoused by Paul Krugman (1979) and Marc Melitz (2003)\xe2\x80\x94on domestic wage inequality, suggesting that trade patterns contribute significantly to widening upper-tail inequality.

"Americans treated themselves to more than 700 million gallons of wine in 2007, fueling a $30 billion industry. Wine is produced in 48 states, often by small-scale wineries whose owners long to expand their business by selling directly to customers nationwide. Many state governments, however, prohibit the direct shipment of wine from out-of-state producers to consumers in their state. Wine must instead pass through wholesalers, who contend that allowing direct shipping would harm not only their business, but also consumers and wineries. Consumers are frustrated by an inability to purchase certain wines locally and accuse wholesalers of using their monopoly on distribution to inflate prices. I will discuss the relevant legal issues and the results of two natural experiments focused on the economic effects of shipping laws in five states, including Massachusetts, that restrict the direct shipment of wine to varying degrees. The Impact of Financial Modernization on Women-owned Businesses'"
"Access to credit is fundamental to the well-being and growth of small businesses, and historically, small businesses have disproportionately received loans from small banks. Two landmark pieces of legislation in the 1990s, the Riegle-Neal of 1994, and the Gram-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, resulted in significant consolidation of smaller banks into larger institutions. This may have had a particularly important impact on women-owned businesses, as women-owned businesses tend to be smaller than men-owned businesses. My research examines the impacts of these banking law changes on the relative access to credit for women-owned businesses compared to men-owned businesses. Using the Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s Survey of Small Business Finances, I look at loan interest rates, size of loans, and likelihood of loan approval for women-owned businesses, controlling for observable characteristics, before and after each law passed to determine the impact of financial modernization on loan financing for women-owned businesses. I further test for whether, conditional on loan terms, female-owned businesses have better outcomes than male-owned businesses. If so, that would provide evidence that banks are using a different decision rubric to determine whether to make loans to women-owned firms.

Ariettes oubli\xc3\xa9es: Symbolist Correspondence between Music and Nature (long performance) Jewett Art Center, Auditorium Elizabeth Merrill \xe2\x80\x9909, Music '"
"Claude Debussy (1862\xe2\x80\x931918) was a com-poser who believed that music had the power to evoke nature without having to directly imitate it. He demonstrates this idea in his song cycle, Ariettes oubli\xc3\xa9es (1885\xe2\x80\x937), which is based on poems by the Symbolist poet, Paul Verlaine (1844\xe2\x80\x931896). Debussy uses compositional innovations in harmony, melody, and texture to highlight natural imagery in his songs. These musical techniques allowed Debussy to convey an experience of nature that was in keeping with ideals of Symbolism, a nineteenth-century literary movement that favored the evocation of objects and emotions through elusive suggestion rather than explicit textual representation. In this presentation, I will undertake text-music analysis to inform my performance of song extracts. My goal in so doing is to show how Debussy\xe2\x80\x99s settings of these poems enhance Verlaine\xe2\x80\x99s allusion to various emotional states, while intensifying the poet\xe2\x80\x99s attention to nature\xe2\x80\x99s effect on human emotion.

"Italy has been experiencing exponential growth in its immigrant population since the early 1990s. Though historically a country of emigration, Italy has some of the toughest and most unforgiving immigration laws in the European Union. Racism and discrimination against immigrants are a recognized problem for both the citizenry and the government. Italian immigration law reflects these negative attitudes. It permits immigrants to enter Italy relatively easily, but makes it nearly impossible for these immigrants to renew their visas and maintain their legal statuses. Instead of returning home, most of these irregular migrants become illegal and are forced to work in the grey sector to preserve their livelihoods. To demonstrate this phenomenon, I examine the experiences navigating modern Italian immigration law of arguably the largest group of migrants in Italy\xe2\x80\x94Albanians\xe2\x80\x94through both research and one-on-one, visually-recorded oral histories.

Yet the military maintained active and passive consensus in Argentina and retained significant foreign support. These feats were primarily accomplished through their use of a new language of power. By publicly introducing strategic words and phrases, the military shaped the perceived reality in Argentina, naturalizing human rights abuses in the process. The military\xe2\x80\x99s use of this new language is contrasted to the language used by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the only Argentine human rights organization that, at the time, publicly denounced the ongoing disappearances.

"Sensory information is processed along parallel tracks within the brain; within each track, information is communicated along a series of hierarchical stages beginning with the sensory receptors and ultimately integrated by brain centers involved in cognition and behavior. Within the visual system of mammals, evidence suggests that parallel tracks process information about color, form, and motion. Our lab is interested in understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie this process. We explore the mechanisms for vision in human and animal models, including macaque monkeys, squirrels, and rats. Monkeys are used to  investigate mechanisms of trichromatic color. Visual experiments investigating object recognition, dichromatic color matching, and spatial navigation are carried out in simpler animals, like rats and squirrels. The lab is also involved in experiments that address the relationship between vision and art.

"As people go about their daily lives, their decisions and actions affect the environment. If individuals adopted more sustainable practices, they could reduce the U.S. carbon emissions and have a positive impact on global warming. While individuals might be aware that their choices have an impact, they often lack the education or motivation to follow-up on sustainable actions.

"What role does a country\xe2\x80\x99s political system play in its commitment to nature preservation? The historian Donald Worster argues, \xe2\x80\x9cThe protection of wild nature owes much to the spread of modern liberal, democratic ideals...\xe2\x80\x9d Based on qualitative studies of the history of environmental protection, he and other historians have argued that democracy has been a driving force in the creation of national parks, wilderness areas, and wildlife refuges.

To address this apparent contradiction, this study evaluates which national characteristics, including the strength of a state\xe2\x80\x99s democracy, the size of its economy, and the extent of its biodiversity, best predict its commitment to establishing nature reserves.

"Orange jewelweed is one of a number of plant species that use ballistic seed dispersal. The seed pods explode, transferring mechanical energy stored in the pod wall to the seeds, increasing their kinetic and potential energies. The mechanical performance of a launch mechanism of this type has not been measured. The valves forming the seed pod wall had a mass specific energy storage capacity of 124 Jkg-1, comparable to that of spring steel. This energy storage capacity depended on the level of tissue hydration, suggesting a role for cell turgor pressure in generating tension within the pod walls. The efficiency with which energy was transferred to the seeds was 0.51 \xc2\xb1 0.26 % (mean \xc2\xb1 SEM, N = 13). This low transfer efficiency may be due to the absence of a direct mechanical connection between the pod valves and the seeds. Leeches Suck\xe2\x80\xa6Then Shrink!

"Blood-sucking leeches can increase their body mass by up to 900% during feeding. This restricts their mobility and makes them vulnerable to predation. This may create a selective pressure for rapid recovery of locomotor capacity. We have found that leeches can recover up to 50% of prefeeding swimming speed within one hour of a meal by actively expelling excess fluid. We performed a series of experiments on the medicinal leech following a blood meal, in order to test whether energy requirements for rapid return to locomotor capability are met via increased oxygen consumption, mobilization of intracellular carbon stores, or behavioral thermoregulation, independent of blood meal digestion. These data offer insight into possible adaptive mechanisms contributing to the rapid locomotor recovery of leeches following a blood meal.

This protein, Patellin1 (PATL1), is one of six PATL proteins found in Arabidopsis and one of forty-four PATLs found throughout the plant kingdom. Phylogenetic analysis has divided the PATLs into four distinct clades, suggesting different roles for different PATL proteins. Using transgenic plants expressing PATL promoter:;reporter gene fusions, we are investigating patterns of PATL1 and PATL3 expression in Arabidopsis thaliana; publicly available microarray coexpression data will also be analyzed for all Arabidopsis PATLs using ATTED-II (Arabidopsis thaliana transfactor and cis-element prediction database) and Arabidopsis eFP (Electronic Fluorescent Pictograph) Browser. This will provide insight into the role of PATL proteins in Arabidopsis and highlight redundancies and singularities in function among  the different PATL family members.

"Small noncoding RNA genes are found throughout all kingdoms of life. They are referred to as sRNA in bacteria and act as posttranscriptional regulators. sRNAs are quickly being discovered, but their cellular functions are still mainly unknown. With recent studies identifying sRNAs as regulators of virulence factors in Vibrio cholera and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, better tools for sRNA target identification are needed. Current computational pro-grams for identifying sRNA targets make predictions based on the maximization of sRNA:mRNA base-pairing. While there is abundant thermodynamic data for ribonucelotide interactions, there is a current lack of programs utilizing these parameters for sRNA:mRNA interaction prediction. For my senior thesis, I wrote a computer program that uses thermodynamic data to predict stable sRNA target interactions. This program was validated on known sRNA:mRNA interactions in a well studied bacterial species. Novel sRNA targets in a less well studied bacterial species were predicted and validated with in vitro experiments. (Research supported by a grant from the National Institutes  of Health.)

With this multiple-gene dataset we are studying the colonization history and mechanisms of diversification of these endemics in five of the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos islands. Preliminary results indicate that contrary to the majority of island colonizers, phylogeny estimates for Stomion do not appear to follow the progression rule of island biogeography whereby islands are colonized according to their age. This interesting preliminary assessment of the diversification patterns in Stomion allows relevant comparisons with already well-established patterns in other systems studied in the laboratory, i.e. Galapaganus.

"VV Cephei and KQ Puppis are binary star systems consisting of a supergiant star with an extensive, expanding wind and a smaller, hotter companion star. When the hot companion\xe2\x80\x99s light shines through the supergiant\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, the absorption of its light by the atmosphere of the supergiant star can give us information about the composition and spatial structure of the supergiant\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere. VV Cephei was observed by the Hubble Space Telescope at different parts of the companion\xe2\x80\x99s orbit, including total eclipse. KQ Puppis was observed only once by Hubble at a configuration similar to some of the VV Cephei observations. For both these star systems, Hubble was able to detect spatially extended emission from the wind of the supergiant. In my poster, I will be comparing the observations of KQ Puppis with those of VV Cephei to analyze the atmospheres of both supergiants. Illness in the Cure Teresa Le \xe2\x80\x9911, Anthropology '"

"\xce\xb1-Synuclein (\xce\xb1Syn) is a small protein that is closely associated with Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s disease (PD). Substantial evidence links \xce\xb1Syn to mitochondrial dysfunction, and there is evidence that \xce\xb1Syn oligomers are the toxic species causing neurodegeneration in PD. Though \xce\xb1Syn is the focus of much research, its pathophysiological role in PD remains unclear. The goal of this project is to understand the functional implications for \xce\xb1Syn overexpression in cells, gain insight on its relationship with mitochondrial health, and determine whether these effects are mediated by \xce\xb1Syn oligomers or monomers. Human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells with and without overexpressed \xce\xb1Syn were treated with a panel of mitochondrial toxins and the effect of \xce\xb1Syn overexpression on cell health was determined by cell viability assays. Also, purified mitochondria and whole cells were exposed to \xce\xb1Syn oligomers, and their mitochondrial health was determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting in order to determine the toxic effects of \xce\xb1Syn oligomers.

Into the Depths of the Mind\xe2\x80\x99s Jungle: A Search for TOP and PEP'"
"In studies of illness related to reproductive physiology, abnormal production of the ovarian steroid hormone estradiol may be an underlying cause for a number of disorders common to women. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is an important regulator of estradiol release. Estradiol, in turn, exerts feedback control on GnRH. GnRH may be further regulated by the hormone degrading enzymes thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) and prolyl endopeptidase (PEP). In this project we analyzed how estradiol affects levels and activity of these two enzymes in various mouse brain regions, using immunohistochemistry and fluorometric activity assays.

Cells in Female Mouse Brain Coexpress Progestin Receptors and Nuclear Receptor Coactivators Christina Tognoni \xe2\x80\x9909, Neuroscience and Spanish, and Courtney Ackeifi \xe2\x80\x9910, Biological Chemistry'"
"The ovarian steroid hormones, estradiol and progesterone, act in the brain to elicit profound effects on behavior and physiology. One physiological function of estradiol is the induction of progestin receptors (PR) in brain and other steroid- sensitive tissues. In this estradiol induction of PR, estradiol binds to estrogen receptors (ER) to induce the transcription of the PR gene in reproductively-relevant brain regions. In vitro studies have shown that nuclear receptor coactivators, such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and SRC-2, enhance the hormone-dependent transcriptional activity of ER. In the present study, we used triple-label immunohistochemistry to investigate the coexpression of SRC-1, SRC-2 and PR in individual cells in female mouse brain regions that regulate reproductive physiology and behavior. These experiments will further our understanding of how hormones act in brain and their possible role in brain disorders that are influenced by hormones, such as Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s Disease and depression.

"For most people who speak more than one language, it is impossible to speak them both at the same time. However, bimodal- bilinguals, people fluent in a signed and a spoken language, can produce elements of both languages simultaneously. Bimodal bilinguals produce ASL facial grammar while speaking English: they raise their eyebrows when speaking an English conditional sentence, and they furrow their eyebrows when asking a wh-question. Yet signers tend to inhibit the expression of  the furrowed brow more than the expression of the raised eyebrows. One possible reason for this inhibition is that the fur- other LNRs can only form two disulfide bonds. In this work we present our findings on the effect of various reduction potentials as well as the elimination of the first disulfide bond in the in vitro folding of hN1 LNRA through a comparative analysis. The results of this study will help to elucidate the impact of disulfide bond formation during LNR folding. Amino Acids That Are Critical for Structural Stability and Functionality within the Heterodimerization Domain of Notch Marina Pellon Consunji \xe2\x80\x9909, Biological Chemistry and International  Relations-Economics, and Lucien C. Montenegro \xe2\x80\x9910, Chemistry '"
"The integral role of Notch proteins in the normal development and tissue homeostasis of metazoans is orchestrated through the tightly regulated proteolytic processing of its Negative Regulatory Region (NRR). Ligand binding at an extracellular region activates Notch by facilitating a proteolytic cleavage at the heterodimerization (HD) domain within the NRR. This cleavage is a prerequisite for the subsequent intramembrane cleavage that permits the translocation of the intracellular region of Notch to the nucleus to activate transcription. In this work we present the algorithms we have developed to evaluate the relative importance of specific amino acids for the structural stability and functionality of the HD domain. These include predictive models derived from bioinformatic analysis as well as experimental data from circular dichroism, chromatography, and mass spectrometry studies that compare the wild-type HD domain with two mutants identified in leukemia patients. Our results provide valuable insight to the mechanism of Notch activation. Characterization of the Ca2+ Binding Affinity and Coordination Site of the LIN-12/Notch Repeat'"
"Notch receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins of a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulate cell fate in multicellular organisms. Notch proteins include three tandem LIN-12/Notch Repeats (LNRs) responsible for maintaining the receptor in its resting conformation prior to ligand binding. These modules contain highly conserved arrangement of three disulfide bonds and a Ca2+ ion that is essential for its correct folding. In our previous work, we used the first repeat of human Notch1 and showed that it exclusively binds to calcium ion. In this work, we used a combination of computer modeling and experimental approaches to characterize and compare the Ca2+ binding affinities and coordination geometries of LNR repeats across different protein families. We expect this work to elucidate the basis for Ca2+ ion selectivity by the LNRs that is integral for their proper regulation in the Notch signaling pathway. LIN-12/Notch Repeat B: The Effects of Disulfide Bonding and Hydrophobic Residues on Its Autonomous Folding'"
"Notch proteins are transmembrane proteins involved in controlling cellular differentiation, growth, and death. An extracellular negative regulatory region (NRR) contains three contiguous LIN-12/Notch Repeats (LNRs)\xe2\x80\x94LNRA, LNRB, and LNRC. Two factors of LNRB folding of much interest are its disulfide bonds and distribution of hydrophobic residues. To study the effect of disulfide bonds on the independent folding of LNRB, one of its three pairs of disulfide bonds was eliminated by mutating cysteine-45 and cysteine-69 to two alanine residues. Because of its more central location in relation to the rest of the protein, LNRB participates in more extensive interactions via its exposed hydrophobic tryptophan residues. To study the possible destabilizing effect of hydrophobicity in LNRB imparted by hydrophobic residues, trypto-phan-52 was mutated to an alanine. This work presents data on different lengths of LNRB with the above-mentioned mutations to help define the minimal requirements for the autonomous folding of LNRB.

"Design, simulation and optimization of electrostatic lenses are crucial to the ion imaging techniques employed to investigate molecular chemical reaction dynamics. The images obtained from studies of photodissociation dynamics are particularly dependent on the electrostatic lens configuration, which determines the spatial quality of the image. In order to optimize image spatial resolution, a simple three-plate electrostatic lens with open electrodes is simulated so that all particles with the same initial velocity vector are mapped onto the same position on a 2D detector, regardless of their initial distance from the electrostatic lens axis. Characterization of the electrostatic lens apparatus is performed using a 3D ion trajectory simulation software package. The simulations are designed to accurately reproduce experimental results and guide the design of a new experimental velocity map imaging apparatus.

"The valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory taught in introductory chemistry predicts the NCN bond of  cyanamide (H2NCN) to be linear. However, experiments have shown that the NCN bond of the molecule is, in fact, slightly bent.

Besides investigating the nonlinearity of cyanamide\xe2\x80\x99s NCN bond with multiple levels of theory, this project also explored the properties of substituted cyanamides to see how the different substituents affect the NCN bond angle in these molecules.

The Inner Workings of the Ballistic Pendulum'"
"How can you determine the velocity of a speeding bullet? It is easier than you might think. Designed in the late eighteenth century, prior to many modern technological advances, the ballistic pendulum was a simple tool used to determine the launch speed of a bullet. Applying the fundamental physical principles of conservation of linear momentum, conservation of angular momentum, and conservation of energy, we used a modified ballistic pendulum to calculate the initial velocity of a steel ball launched from a spring-loaded gun. Can the law of conservation of linear momentum be applied in this situation? How does conservation of energy even relate? We will not only discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods we implemented but also draw conclusions regarding our experimental results.

"Many preschoolers create relationships with imaginary companions, and these special friends generally fit into one of two categories: invisible companions or personified objects (e.g., a stuffed animal that the child treats as real). I examined videos of children with and without imaginary companions, who were asked to engage in three types of games: teaching, caretaking, and free-play. Through these videos,  I want to compare children with and without imaginary companions, as well as children with either invisible or personified imaginary friends, in terms of their levels of engagement for the three tasks and their game preferences. I would also like to examine whether the type of relationship a child has with his or her imaginary companion, whether hierarchical or egalitarian, relates to how children play. These comparisons will show us how children represent relationships through play and tell us how they conceptualize their real and imaginary relationships with others.

The Role of Explicit Memory in Priming Effects Priya Josyula \xe2\x80\x9910, Neuroscience, and Sara Teichholtz \xe2\x80\x9909, Neuroscience '"
"Human memory is made up of multiple subtypes, each of which operates through a different mechanism. Two subtypes are explicit (conscious) and implicit (unconscious) memory. An example of implicit memory is priming, where performance is influenced by recent experience, even though one is not explicitly remembering that experience. For instance, if individuals are asked to identify a very briefly flashed word (e.g. 13 milliseconds), performance is improved if they have had recent exposure to the word. Surprisingly, while explicit memory is impaired in amnesia, implicit memory, including priming, is largely retained. However, in a recent study, amnesic and healthy control participants unexpectedly displayed different priming patterns. Our study questions whether these differences are due to the use of explicit memory by healthy control subjects.

"Midway through Middlemarch, the young Dorothea Casaubon resolves to complete her dying husband\xe2\x80\x99s Key to All Mythologies\xe2\x80\x94a work so ineffectual and time-consuming it would preclude  her desire to lead \xe2\x80\x9can epic life\xe2\x80\xa6 of far-resonant action.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather than indicating failed ambitions, Dorothea\xe2\x80\x99s decision marks her moral maturity, for she now realizes that compassion and sacrifice are inseparable and seldom bring glory. Before Dorothea can make her promise, her husband dies, and, through his will, she discovers his intent to make a second, more sinister demand. Paradoxically, in a novel committed to sacrifice, Dorothea then revokes her decision to complete the Key. Does Eliot have her do so because the sacrifice would be too great? Because Casaubon is unworthy? Or because she never officially made the promise? Critics have long struggled with these questions, and I will explore them through a comparison of Dorothea\xe2\x80\x99s intended sacrifice with Mrs. Bulstrode\xe2\x80\x99s fulfilled one.

Not only have they survived for billions of years, but they have been found in extremely diverse locations, ranging from glaciers to geysers. With that much longevity and diversity, these bacteria have adapted significantly to survive under many stressful conditions.

"Airborne pollution and acid rain are causing the acidification of bodies of fresh-water around the world. Cyanobacteria are being threatened by this man-made ecological disaster. Since cyanobacteria have adapted to survive in environments with alkaline pH, the decreasing pH of their habitats will have important consequences for cyanobacteria and the entire freshwater ecosystem. In the lab we are trying to determine how the bacteria will respond to acidification by stressing them at low pH and attempting to identify proteins that are expressed differently under acid-stress. Proteomic techniques such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, trypsin digestion, and MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry will be discussed. (Research supported by the Roberta Day Staley and Karl A.

"Membrane proteins involved in transporting Na+ and H+ ions across the membrane, Na+/H+ antiporters, may help regulate the internal and external pH of acid-stressed cyanobacteria. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 contains at least five Na+/H+ antiporters. Studies suggest that these proteins help regulate the internal pH of acid-stressed cells, but how are the internal pH and Na+ concentration of cells with a 1.5 \xce\xbcm diameter measured? 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to determine the chemical shift of the pH sensitive inorganic phosphate peak. 23Na NMR spectroscopy using chemical shift reagents is used to detect the relative amounts of Na+ inside and outside the cells.

"Many different forms of bacteria form a biofilm as a coping mechanism during times of stress. A biofilm is an aggregate of bacterial cells surrounded by a sticky extracellular matrix anchored to a biotic or abiotic surface. The main component of this matrix is exopolysacharride, or EPS. Often the presence of type IV pili, small hair-like appendages coating a cell\xe2\x80\x99s surface, are rumored to have an important role in the initial anchoring and subsequent growth of biofilms, along with motility of cells that are not in a biofilm. In this research I am finding if the cyanobacterial species Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, which exhibits surface motility and has type IV pili, forms biofilms. I grow the bacteria under a variety of stressful conditions and then search for the presence of EPS. I then support these results by verifying the presence of type IV  pili using the electron microscope. (Research supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.)

"Water pollution with heavy metals is a problem worldwide, including on the Wellesley College campus in Lake Waban and Paintshop Pond. Lead is one such heavy metal that can cause hypertension and impair nerve and kidney function if ingested. Bioremediation is a method of removing pollutants using microorganisms, and cyanobacteria might be model organisms to remove heavy metals from polluted waters. One cannot, however, release cyanobacteria directly into the water, as this would disrupt the ecosystem. Cyanobacteria can be contained within beads made of calcium-alginate, an algae-derived substance, and the beads could easily be removed from the water system after remediation. The beads themselves can also remove metals from water. Our research examines the ability of cyanobacteria, free and immobilized within beads, to remediate lead from water systems.

"Animal models provide a unique opportunity to study basic mechanisms of human disease, such as how genetic and nutritional factors interact to influence disease symptoms, and to test preclinical therapies. Rett Syndrome (RTT) and Schizophrenia (Schz) are both neurological disorders that originate early in fetal development and are linked to specific genetic mutations. However, nutritional factors can also influence the severity of symptoms. Here, we test the effects of maternal nutritional supplementation (choline) or deprivation (folate) around the time of birth in genetically modified mice that model RTT and Schz, respec-tively. In RTT-like offspring, we find that choline supplementation improves both physical and cognitive symptoms. In Schz-like offspring, a single genetic mutation unexpectedly protects against the harmful physical and cognitive effects of folate deficiency. These nutritional manipulations, both choline and folate, interact with genetic mutations to influence neurological disorders and underscore the critical nature of maternal nutrition.

Investigations of Disease  (short talks) Pendleton East 239 The Significance of Stable DC-T Cell Interactions in the Differentiation of Effector T Cells'"
"The immune system constantly surveys the body for the presence of antigen. It operates mainly through T cells and B cells to fight off foreign invaders, called antigens, that gain access to the body and dendritic cells (DC), which are specialized in alerting the immune system about the presence of antigens. T cells originate in the bone marrow as stem cells and migrate to the thymus, where they differentiate into different types of T cells. They then leave the thymus as na\xc3\xafve T cells and circulate in the blood and secondary lymphoid organs searching for antigen presentation DCs. At the onset of this initial T cell-DC interaction there are three phases, each characterized with a specific T cell-DC interaction duration. In this study, we have looked at the significance of phase II, characterized by the stable interaction between T cells and DCs, with respect to activation, proliferation, cytotoxicity and memory generation.

The goal of this research is to determine which regions of \xce\xb1-synuclein are involved in aggregation. With this information, drugs may be produced to target these regions specifically. Twenty residue fragments were synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis and purified using HPLC. Lewy bodies are known to exhibit a b-sheet secondary structure; the goal is to determine which fragments of \xce\xb1-synuclein are more prone to be in this conformation. Using FTIR spectroscopy, the secondary structure of fragments was determined by examining the amide I band. Those fragments with a predominantly b-sheet structure were further examined to determine their aggregation kinetics using the fluorescent dye Thioflavin T. Aggregates that form more easily and rapidly are thought to be more essential in forming the toxic species.

"Informal observations have often been made that a country\xe2\x80\x99s language is reflected in its instrumental music. Language and music are both ways of organizing sound, and it may be that the distinctive temporal and melodic patterning of a language also appears in the related music. Little research has explored this possibility, but the few studies conducted have found similarities between the rhythmic and melodic characteristics of French music and language on the one hand and British music and language on the other. Using acoustic measurements, my research compares the rhythmic and melodic characteristics of the music and language of the Shetland Islands in Scotland, County Donegal in Ireland, and the state of Kentucky. It aims to determine if these characteristics are correlated in the speech and music in each dialect area; such a correlation may provide support for the hypothesis that music and language share processing resources in the brain.

"A controversial topic in linguistics is known as the argument/adjunct distinction. Arguments are phrases that form integral components of a verb\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, while adjuncts are simply \xe2\x80\x9cmodifiers.\xe2\x80\x9d For example, in \xe2\x80\x9cMary gave the package to the mailman in the afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cin the afternoon\xe2\x80\x9d is an adjunct, while the other bracketed phrases are arguments. This distinction is important for the study of linguistic ambiguity, especially PP-attachment ambiguity. For example, the PP \xe2\x80\x9cwith the telescope\xe2\x80\x9d in the sentence \xe2\x80\x9cThe detective saw the man with the telescope\xe2\x80\x9d could mean that the detective used the telescope to see the man or that the man he saw had a telescope.

Through looking at the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s student-teacher interactions with Professional-Amateur (Pro-Am), social, and competitive dance students, it is arguable that gender performance in the American ballroom dance workplace is largely dictated by the American public\xe2\x80\x99s demand for dance instruction and by the use of traditional gender roles within actual dance performance/competition.

"Women have made great progress across all fields of science, especially bioscience. However, unemployment statistics and leadership position statistics indicate that gender inequality is still ever present in the bioscience workplace. Yesterday, women faced blatant discrimination due to stereotypes; today, women face subtle discrimination and a glass ceiling. Drawing on my summer internship in a bioscience laboratory, I address the question: Although there is an equal percentage of qualified women and men potential employees for the bioscience workforce, why is there still gender inequality in employment rates and structure of the workplace? At my internship, I experienced first hand the practices that uphold the glass ceiling. However, the company\xe2\x80\x99s decision to allow my participation in research displayed that they are open to the idea of allowing women to participate at an equal level and that their gendered practices may be subconscious.

"Due to the feminist movements of the twentieth century, the modern workplace is now outwardly more open to female advancement than in the recent past. Places of employment in the public service sector specifically have been experiencing a shift in gender representation and employment structures. However, the barrier of the \xe2\x80\x9cglass ceiling\xe2\x80\x9d for employed women is still a very real phenomenon. Do gendered interactions in offices of female elected officials accurately reflect this structural change that has been occurring in the public sector? At the office of one of relatively few female elected officials in the United States, the observed workplace was progressive in many ways. However, the gendered actions that were visible but not discussed showed that even work environments that are better than most in terms of gender equality still have a need for improvement.

"Whether they are used to facilitate dialogue or to grasp at a particular word, gestures are embedded in most, if not all, linguistic interactions.

In our previous research, we compared the TOT experiences of participants who were allowed to gesture to those were prohibited from gesturing. While we found no overall difference in number of TOTs, we found that once in a TOT state, the gesture-allowed group was more successful at resolving their TOTs. In this follow-up study, we ask whether inhibition of another body part, in this case the neck, can affect the resolution of TOTs. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to a gesture allowed, gesture inhibited, or neck inhibited condition and were asked to name 52 pictures. The findings will speak to the nature of the relationship between gesture and speech. (Research supported by the Office of the Dean of the College.)

"Italian tax evasion is one of the highest among developed countries. As noncompliance has negative effects on equality and government revenues, in the 1990s the Italian government attempted to reduce noncompliance by implementing the \xe2\x80\x9cStudi di Settore\xe2\x80\x9d (SDS). Under the SDS, the Italian government provides small/medium businesses with a tool to estimate gross revenues, according to their field of activity. This estimation becomes a benchmark; if firms declare their revenues to be less than the benchmark, then the probability of audits becomes larger. In my honors thesis, I empirically test the effectiveness of the SDS method. I expect the introduction of the SDS to have led to more substantial changes in declared income among those types of firms that historically have had more tax evasion, such as smaller firms and firms in the Southern region. I test this hypothesis using data from the Italian tax authority. Do Institutions Create a One-way Street for Foreign Direct Investment?'"
"Does a country\xe2\x80\x99s legal framework, its prevailing investment environment, or its corruption levels have an effect on its economic outcomes? This relationship between the quality of a country\xe2\x80\x99s institutions and national economic outcomes is difficult to estimate statistically because of reverse causality and issues related to measurement error. My thesis makes an attempt to overcome this challenge by analyzing the impact of institutions on foreign direct investment in the aftermath of an external growth shock to the economy. The preliminary regression results indicate that the adverse impact of a negative growth shock on FDI is less in a country with good institutions. In the aftermath of a positive growth shock, however, institutions do not play a similar role i.e. they do not increase the flow of FDI. My presentation will outline the identification strategy for growth shocks, the methodology used, and the validity of my results. Basketball: For Love of the Game or for the Love of Money?

"Ragtime, America\xe2\x80\x99s popular music of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, was influenced by European dance music, the concert band march, and African American spirituals and folk songs. When it emerged in the late 1800s, ragtime was played by string bands to accompany high-spirited social dances. Composers also published original ragtime pieces as sheet music for wider public consumption. Although most such ragtime compositions (\xe2\x80\x9crags\xe2\x80\x9d) were scored for either solo piano or piano and voice, some were written for other instruments, such as banjo and accordion.

"Within a world defined by new levels of interconnectedness, dependency, and com-petition, globalization has fundamentally changed the ways countries economically compete. Strategic sequencing of economic policies is a necessity in creating economic stability and growth, but not the sole requirement. Rather, multidimensional sequencing describes the strategic sequencing of policies within economic, social, and state capacity realms to assure economic stability and growth. This theory, culminating honors senior thesis research and a summer of fieldwork in India through a CWS-identified internship, is the explicit recognition of the interdependency of the economy on state and social dimensions, as supported by an extensive case study of the economically promising country India. Through understanding the current status within India, it becomes evident that policy sequencing within the political institutions, the social sector, and the market provide the most comprehensive strategy to allow developing states the ability to participate in the global economy.

In order to obtain higher resolution localized images and spectra we have designed and built a new surface coil that resonates at the Larmor frequency of protons in our Bruker Avance (400 MHz, 9.4 Tesla (T), 8.9 cm vertical bore) micro MRI system. We have also optimized parameters of different three-dimensional pulse sequences that can be used to produce fast high-resolution, 3-D images in our ongoing mouse and crayfish studies.

"the College Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1/10,000 girls, making it the second leading cause of mental retardation in females. The goal of our research is to study the neurochemistry of RTT using the mouse model Mecp21lox. The non-invasive techniques of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy allow us to perform a longitudinal study of the mice between ages three and six weeks. The images obtained are used to localize the region for spectroscopy (image below). Spectra of brain metabolites such as creatine, choline, glutamine, glutamate, taurine, and N-acetylaspartate are then quantified; these neurochemicals are involved in important brain functions. Eventually, this will help us monitor disease progression, identify RTT at an early stage, and investigate the neurochemical effects of potential treatments.

"Neurogenesis, the process of generating new neurons, is important in learning and memory. Our lab is interested in using Activity-induced Manganese MRI (AIM MRI) to identify potential sites of neurogenesis in an invertebrate model, a crustacean called Cherax destructor. AIM MRI cannot directly visualize the production of new neurons; however, new neurons normally appear in activated regions of the brain. AIM MRI uses the contrast agent manganese, Mn2+, to visualize activated regions of the crustacean\xe2\x80\x99s brain. Mn2+ travels through the blood-stream and is taken up by tissues through calcium-gated ion channels. When synapses fire, the activity of calcium-gated ion channels increases, which leads to an elevated uptake of Mn2+. The regions with increased Mn2+ concentrations produce areas of increased intensity in MRI images.

Scratch, an easy-to-use programming language, provides a means for kids to design and implement their own projects, teaching creative problem solving skills in the process. As children actively write programs, the computer becomes a tool for artistic expression rather than a surrogate TV. Used in conjunction with the PicoBoard, this research explored ways of extending Scratch programs to the real world. Using various art supplies and craft materials, several sample projects were created to illustrate the immense possibilities of the PicoBoard.

"As the Internet becomes a more dangerous place and as software becomes increasingly complex, computer security becomes more important. Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an extension to the Linux operating system that provides fine-grained controls for preventing malicious agents from exploiting software vulnerabilities. It can be very effective, but its policy language is extremely low-level, making it difficult to map a high-level idea of a security policy to what needs to be done in SELinux. To address this discrepancy, I am building a language on top of SELinux to implement administrative role-based access control (ARBAC), an intuitive and flexible security paradigm well suited for user confinement. This language will better express high-level security policies and help prevent Linux security vulnerabilities from becoming exploits. Evaluating the Role of Syntax for Novice Programmers: Is Drag and Drop Really a Drag? Ariel Hathaway \xe2\x80\x9909, Media Arts  and Sciences '"
"Novice programmers are often initially frustrated with the strict syntax of computer programming languages. Recently, in an effort to ignite interest in computer programming and eliminate some of the difficulties that novice programmers may face, computer-based learning environments have been developed, which eliminate the need for the user to learn the syntax associated with a programming language. These applications allow users to drag and drop code segments, thus enabling them to learn the logic and problem-solving fundamentals of programming, without the risk of producing incorrect code. Despite the increasing popularity of such environments in computer science classrooms, the question remains\xe2\x80\x94are these methods efficient for teaching programming, or do they simply prolong the inevitable of learning proper programming syntax?

"The interactive medium of the Internet, specifically through Web sites such as YouTube.com, provides presidential candidates with innovative ways to advertise. The 2008 presidential campaign was the first during which YouTube existed, and both major party candidates took advantage of this new advertising tool. Both candidates not only posted their television ads there, but they also produced ads that were just distributed online. This project seeks to determine whether Internet ads differ significantly from their TV counter parts or are just more of the same. This subject is very important because Internet ads will likely play a larger role in coming campaigns, and if this new medium is especially negative, it may alienate voters and fail to realize its potential as a democratizing force in elections.

Veronica Cole \xe2\x80\x9909, Psychology '"
"In times of political uncertainty, some individuals cling to convention, resist change, and show antipathy to those unlike them. These individuals exhibit a trait known as Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), which is linked to many forms of intolerance and prejudice. Using longitudinal data spanning from adolescence to late adulthood, we isolated two pathways leading from adolescent personality to authoritarianism in old age. First, RWA in old age was predicted by an absence of wide interests, and a lack of introspective-ness and openness to new experiences in adolescence; this finding has been reported by other researchers. Secondly, we found that, independently of lack of openness to experience, authoritarianism at age 70 was characteristic of individuals who as adolescents were fearful and sub-missive but simultaneously reported troubled relations with parents. For these individuals, intolerance and prejudice appear to be the result of displacement of personal hostility onto the outside world. Culture of Secrecy'"

In this study, a mouse-on-mouse pull-down assay was developed to examine the physical interactions between GST-tagged mouse PR subtypes and coactivators from mouse brain. By taking a proteomic-based approach, we hope to identify other coactivators and potentially novel proteins that physically interact with PR subtypes to mediate progesterone action in the brain.

"Under low light chloroplasts spread out within a cell in order to maximize light interception (accumulation response); at high light they move to the edges of the cells minimizing light interception (avoidance response). A comparison of 10 widely di\xef\xac\x80erent plant species showed that while all plants showed accumulation and avoidance responses, the kinetics and the magnitudes of chloroplast movement were signi\xef\xac\x81cantly di\xef\xac\x80erent.

Bugging Out (short talks) Science Center 104 Nutrient Dependent Regulation  of the Timing of the Molt in Manduca sexta Larvae Karen Kemirembe \xe2\x80\x9912, Biological Sciences and Spanish '"
"Molting, or the shedding of the epidermis, is crucial to insect growth and development. Although the mechanism underlying the secretion of the molting hormone, ecdysone, is known, the factors regulating its expression and the timing of the molt remain poorly understood. To examine whether certain nutrients obtained from diets are responsible for the initiation of the molt, fourth instar Manduca sexta larvae were fed diets of varied nutrient concentrations and composition until they molted. Results showed a direct correlation between the amount of protein intake and the duration of molting. Sucrose, however, failed to induce a molt. Amino acids, coupled with TOR signaling therefore may play a key role in regulating the molting process. Investigations on the link between amino acids and the endocrine regulation of molting are underway.

The Role of Temperature and Hox Genes on the Regulation of Abdominal Pigmentation in Oncopeltus fasciatus'"
"Complex traits, such as body pigmentation, often exhibit phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a genotype to produce contrasting phenotypes in di\xef\xac\x80erent environments. Yet the mechanism underlying phenotypic plasticity is not well understood. To begin to investigate the regulation of phenotypic plasticity in abdominal pigmentation of the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, the roles of Hox genes were investigated. The knockdown of Abd-B Hox gene expression through RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in increased abdominal pigmentation, indicating that Abd-B likely plays a repressive role in the temperature sensitive regulation of abdominal coloration. Furthermore, bugs injected with Abd-A double-stranded RNA developed into adults that completely lacked abdominal pigmentation, indicating that Abd-A most likely plays an important role in the generation of the black pattern. Analyses of genetic interactions between these two Hox genes and the temperature sensitivity of Hox gene expression are currently underway.

"Normal organismal development requires the correct timing of developmental events, and coordination of these events is a result of programmed changes in gene expression. One gene implicated in the temporal organization of development encodes for the transcriptional regulator Abrupt. Much of what is known about its role comes from Drosophila studies: repression of Abrupt in \xef\xac\x82y abdominal muscles during pupal development prevents progression to the adult stage, and Abrupt may temporally regulate border cell motility through ecdysone signaling in \xef\xac\x82y ovaries. To examine the evolutionary conservation of the function of this gene, the e\xef\xac\x80ect of removal of Abrupt was examined in the beetle Tribolium casteneum using RNA interference (RNAi). Abrupt RNAi resulted in phenotypes that included precocious eye development, reduction in pupal wings, and fusion of adjacent segments of the antennae. Further investigation on the expression of Abrupt in Tribolium development and its potential interactors are underway. (Research supported by the O\xef\xac\x83ce of the Dean of the College.)

However,  the roles of FGFs in the postembryonic development of insects remains to be characterized. To elucidate the developmental roles of Fgfs and the \xef\xac\x81broblast growth factor receptor (Fgfr) in larvae of the beetle Tribolium castaneum, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to deplete the four Fgf genes (Fgf1a, Fgf1b, Fgf8, and Bnl) and Fgfr gene products in the last larval stage. The knockdowns of Bnl and Fgfr both produced defects in cuticle scleritization and texture in the larval and pupal stages. The knockdown of Fgf8 resulted in disrupted gut tracheation in the adult stage. In contrast, the Fgf1a and Ffg1b knockdowns did not produce any morphological changes. Experiments  to determine the e\xef\xac\x80ects of Fgfr and Bnl knockdowns on epidermal cell proliferation, tracheal development, and leg regeneration are underway.

"Did you know that Koreans have been migrating to Russia since the 1860s? They mostly settled in the Russian Far East and by the early 1900s, there were more than 300,000 Koreans in the region. However, in 1937, Stalin forcefully removed approximately 180,000 Koreans from the Russian Far East to Central Asia. These deported Koreans are known as Koryo Saram and the majority of Koryo Saram have been living in Central Asia for the past 70 years. However, since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Koryo Saram in Central Asia are facing language, religious, and ethnic discrimination as they try to adapt in the newly formed republics of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

"Harriet Beecher Stowe\xe2\x80\x99s anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Cabin is often cited as one of American literature\xe2\x80\x99s most successful social justice works. It is also agreed among literary critics to be one of the most racist works of American \xef\xac\x81ction. In the novel Stowe pronounces evils of slavery while providing stereotypical depictions of black characters. Stowe\xe2\x80\x99s sentimental writing style results in her attributing a great deal of sentimental integrity to the African race. This is countered by her belief in racial essentialism. The end result? An anti-slavery novel that is benevolently racist, esteeming the African race while carefully assuring the superiority of white America. These factors, as well as others, are responsible for making Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Cabin a novel that galvanized a nation and caricatured a people, which is perhaps why it is one of the most telling and meaningful works of American literature today.

Environmental Issues Environmental Policy:  A Global Perspective (panel) Science Center 104 In order to understand how to make environmental policy, we need to understand how and why various actors behave when faced with environmental issues. This panel considers four separate research papers that ask about the determinants of environmental behavior. What gives disadvantaged states bargaining power in international negotiations or leads developing states to comply with international environ-mental agreements? Under what conditions do states form precautionary or permissive rules to protect against new technologies and how do communities respond to efforts to create these new technologies from their resources? These papers all evaluate the role of socioeconomic and political factors in determining environ-mental outcomes. Non-compliance with International Environmental Agreements'"
International environmental agreements continue to grow in importance and number. When do states make an e\xef\xac\x80ort to follow international agreements? When a state is found in violation of international expectations are there ways to predict whether the state is likely to return to compliance? Are there actions the international community can take which make a return to compliance faster or more likely? Knowing which states will make the e\xef\xac\x80ort to return to conformity with international rules can help create stronger environmental regulations on the international level. I examine 22 countries that spent time out of compliance with the Montreal Protocol in an e\xef\xac\x80ort to determine what traits are held in common by states that become non-compliant and then successfully return to compliance. Community Response to Bioprospecting (or Biopiracy?) in Central and South America'

Factors examined include economy type, colonial language use, domestic regulation, and non-governmental organization involvement. Communities with a greater level of participation in the capitalist economy were more likely to comply with or even embrace bioprospectors, while communities with higher levels of pro\xef\xac\x81ciency in the colonial language were more likely to actively resist a project. For activists who wish to prevent the exploitation of indigenous communities by \xe2\x80\x9cbiopirates,\xe2\x80\x9d these data suggest that increased economic independence and education in the colonial language could help communities protect themselves.

"The genre of poems about paintings, called ekphrasis, has fascinated poets from Homer to the present. In my senior thesis, I studied the role of visual art in the poetry of John Keats, Wallace Stevens, and John Ashbery.  I examined questions such as how poets rep-resent (or do not represent) visual works such as sculpture and painting in language and the role visual art plays in relation to desire and the imagination. In addition to considering traditional mediums of visual art such as painting and sculpture, I looked at how these poets incorporate visual information into their poetry, such as Keats\xe2\x80\x99s sonnet Bright Star which focuses on a speaker looking at an object and the attractions and problems of a solely visual engagement with the world.

How might the concepts of tonic/dominant and major/minor apply to a non-tonal mode? I will also present excerpts from my song cycle, the harmony of which is based around a palindromic mode where diminished and augmented chords replace major and minor triads, and the \xe2\x80\x9ctonic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdominant\xe2\x80\x9d are related by an augmented fourth. Finally, I will discuss how I used this new musical language to express Dorothy Parker\xe2\x80\x99s poetry. George Sand\xe2\x80\x99s Mauprat:  A New Adaptation for a New Era (field studies, performance) Pendleton East 139'"
"I will present my French Honors thesis/Pamela Daniels Fellowship project: the writing and staging of my adaptation of George Sand\xe2\x80\x99s 1837 novel, Mauprat. The author of the novel adapted the play herself in 1851 for the stage as a result of its extreme popularity. Her play received a lukewarm reception by the public and was criticized by critics of the era. The new adaptation, set as an eighteenth century courtroom drama, chronicles the transformation of Bernard de Mauprat, from a savage into a civilized man as a result of education and love. I will discuss how I adapted a nineteenth century novel for the stage, focusing on the challenges of maintaining the central message of Sand while updating them for a new audience. Several scenes from my play will be performed, after which I will discuss the process of staging and directing based on Sand\xe2\x80\x99s own techniques. Political Development War, Independence, and Leadership (short talks)  Pendleton East 339 Crises, Contagion, and Leadership Changes'"
"The \xef\xac\x81nancial and economic crisis that began in 2007 quickly became a topic of much heated debate in the 2008 United States presidential election. However, thorough empirical analysis of the relationship between crises and leadership changes remains relatively inchoate due to two principal reasons, which my research seeks to address. First, the direction of causality between crises and political transitions remains unclear: which precedes the other? The goal of my research is to employ contagion as an instrument to study the causal e\xef\xac\x80ects of crises on leadership changes, controlling for various country-speci\xef\xac\x81c characteristics and variation across time. In addition, I utilize multiple criteria for the crisis variable, instead of focusing mainly on the decline in income as a proxy for all economic or \xef\xac\x81nancial shocks. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, I observe three types of crises: banking crises, income crises, and currency crises. Politics, Investments, and Instability in a Changing West African Geopolitical Dynamics'"
"Africana Studies Discourse on growing foreign investments and on dysfunctional political structures dominates contemporary West African Francophone geopolitics. New economic partners such as China have opened di\xef\xac\x80erent frontiers, a situation leading to a lessening regional hegemony from France, the traditional partner of most countries in the region. While some see this provisional autonomy as an opportunity to tackle the daunting task of successfully recreating post-colonial political structures, many governments have used this newfound autonomy to undermine democratic rule in their countries. Niger, one of the largest uranium exporters in the world, underwent a contested constitutional change in favor of indeterminate power rule despite threats of political isolation and economic sanction from ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, and from the European Union. Ultimately, how has the emergence of these new markets, many of which profess a policy of non-interference in politics, changed the governance structure of West African countries?

"In the twentieth century, the traditional idea of Democracy was shaped and questioned by the totalitarian systems which developed during those hundred years. The rise and fall of the Soviets, Fascism, and Nazism were proof of its precariousness and ultimate success. One of the strongest democratic movements of that period, however, occurred in Spain in 1931 with the birth of the Second Spanish Republic. When \xef\xac\x81sticu\xef\xac\x80s erupted between the newborn Republic and the Bourgeoisie supported by the Fascist army\xe2\x80\x94igniting the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)\xe2\x80\x94the cries of democratic Spain went unheeded by many western powers. At its beginning, the majority of the population supported the democratic transformation of the country, but by war\xe2\x80\x99s end, democratic sympathies had become a death sentence. What factors led to such an outcome? How did a burgeoning democratic society with majority support fail? Our presentation examines the complex factors that lead to a Fascist victory. Science and Technology Perception and Memory  (short talks) Pendleton East 239 Color Memory and Color Discrimination Kate Munger \xe2\x80\x9910, Neuroscience  and Anthropology '"
"Two studies on color perception in  humans will be presented: the \xef\xac\x81rst on color memory and the second on color discrimination. Color memory describes the perceptual phenomena where familiar objects appear more saturated than they truly are. This \xef\xac\x81rst line of research explores how color memory in\xef\xac\x82uences artists\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions and consequently renditions of familiar objects. The second study in this presentation analyzes the human ability to discriminate between colors. Subjects were given a delayed match to sample, two alternative forced choice test. It has previously been demonstrated that the human ability to discriminate between colors is not uniform over the visible spectrum. This study seeks to characterize these non-uniformities in humans and compare them to the discriminatory performance of trichromatic macaque monkeys given the same task. Conscious Perception Jillian Cunningham \xe2\x80\x9910, Neuroscience, Neria Douglass \xe2\x80\x9910, Neuroscience, and Linnea Herzog \xe2\x80\x9912, Neuroscience '"
"The Wiest lab\xe2\x80\x99s research centers on decoding the neural mechanisms responsible for conscious perception, also known as the neural correlates of consciousness or NCC. We are training rats to perform a detection task in which they must consciously perceive an auditory stimulus. We will eventually reduce the volume of the tone to a level that can be detected only 50% of the time. This way, the same stimulus may or may not produce a conscious perception, depending on whether the rat detects the stimulus or not. Using electrode arrays, we will record from di\xef\xac\x80erent cortical regions as the rats perform this detection task in order to determine which regions of the brain are involved in generating a conscious perception, and whether neuronal synchronization is required.

I Never Forget a Face: The Link between Face Memory and Career Emily Strong \xe2\x80\x9910, Psychology '"
"We\xe2\x80\x99ve all heard of politicians who \xe2\x80\x9cnever forget a face,\xe2\x80\x9d but despite empirical reports, the phenomenon has never been studied before. We proposed that individuals in careers that involve more social interaction have a greater ability to remember faces. Participants in the \xef\xac\x81elds of politics, business, and pastoral work completed a demographics survey and took the Super-Recognizer form of the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT). Results indicate that individuals in politics are signi\xef\xac\x81cantly better at face memory tasks in comparison to controls, while individuals in business perform within the normal range, and individuals in pastoral work may perform worse. Though contradicting our hypothesis, these results provide important insights into individual di\xef\xac\x80erences in face recognition and indicate that people in politics are an important group to target for further face memory research.

"Attention is a fundamental cognitive process that de\xef\xac\x81nes human experience. However, there are limits on our capacity to attend to information that is being presented to us. Meditation may be one way to enhance this attentional capacity, helping individuals achieve greater attentional \xef\xac\x82exibility. The focus of this study was on a phenomenon known as the attentional blink. During this phenomenon, an individual\xe2\x80\x99s attention is captured by one stimulus, which prevents attention to other stimuli for a brief period of time. The e\xef\xac\x80ect of seven days of meditation on the attentional blink phenomenon was measured. The experimental group included 24 older meditators and the control group included 24 age-matched individuals who did not engage in meditation. The attentional blink was also examined in 24 younger individuals who did not engage in meditation. Performance on questionnaires measuring empathy, rumination, and stress was also investigated before and after seven days of meditation.

"The muscles of swimming \xef\xac\x81sh expend energy to maintain balance and maneuver-ability, power forward propulsion, and drive respiratory movements. The aim of this study is to investigate the relative energetic costs of these di\xef\xac\x80erent skeletal muscle roles in Rainbow Trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, during undulatory swimming. By injecting microspheres into trouts\xe2\x80\x99 bloodstream to trace muscle blood \xef\xac\x82ow and by monitoring oxygen consumption in a \xef\xac\x82ume tank, the correlation between blood \xef\xac\x82ow, muscle oxygen consumption, and aerobic energy expenditure during active swimming is being investigated. Thus, by measuring blood \xef\xac\x82ow through looking at microsphere concentration in speci\xef\xac\x81c areas of skeletal muscles, their aerobic energy expenditure is determined. Results indicate the di\xef\xac\x80erence in functional cost among groups of skeletal muscle, the increase in blood-\xef\xac\x82ow per gram of muscle from anterior to posterior mytomes, and the transition from branchial pumping to ram ventilation during swimming.

Versatile Design of a Chamber for Environmental Photochemistry of Small Molecules Using the Velocity Map Imaging Technique Madeline Elkins \xe2\x80\x9910, Chemistry '"
"Among the fundamental ideas of physical chemistry is the study of the nature of chemical reactions. In general chemistry classes, chemical reactions are described by simple equations such as A + B -> C + D; however, this gives little information about how the reaction actually takes place on a molecular level. As physical chemists, we understand reactions as a series of transitions between known quantum mechanical states, so by mapping how energy \xef\xac\x82ows between these states over the course of a reaction, we know why and how the reaction occurred. As a primary goal, the project consists of the design and construction of an experimental vessel for gaining this type of state-speci\xef\xac\x81c information for gas-phase photodissociation reactions. An understanding of the process of photodissocation, A + light -> C + D, is crucial to our understanding of our atmosphere and thus combating problems like global climate change.

"Smooth pursuit eye movements refer to the ability of the eyes to follow a moving object smoothly, e.g., watching a baseball \xef\xac\x82y over a \xef\xac\x81eld. Previous studies in our lab have found a small relationship between smooth pursuit precision and both athletic and video game playing abilities. Surprisingly though, a particularly strong relationship was found with gender, favoring males. We have conducted a replication of the previous studies to see if we would again \xef\xac\x81nd a gender di\xef\xac\x80erence, and extended those studies to probe for a relation-ship between smooth pursuit precision and current and/or prenatal hormone levels, which are responsible for large sex di\xef\xac\x80erences in physical abilities and a variety of cognitive tasks.

A Day in the Life of a Cyanobacterium  (panel) Pendleton West 116 Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria of ecological and evolutionary importance. Since the evolution of cyanobacteria over 3 billion years ago, these organisms have been impacting earth\xe2\x80\x99s environment, from the formation of our oxygenic atmosphere to responses to pollution and global warming. Three physiological and biochemical properties of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis are studied in our lab: bioremediation, acid-stress response, and biofilm formation. Combating Pollution:  The Application of Cyanobacteria for Lead Bioremediation'"
"Water pollution is a major human health problem that limits access to clean drinking water worldwide. Lead is a heavy metal that is commonly found at unsafe levels in freshwater due to pollution. Lead can cause irreversible damage to the reproductive, nervous, and cardiovascular systems. Bioremediation, the use of biological organisms for the treatment of polluted environments, is a promising method for water decontamination. Cyanobacteria have been demonstrated to absorb heavy metals. This project examines the potential of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis for lead bioremediation. To allow easy application and removal from water systems, the bacteria are immobilized in beads made of alginate, a substance derived from brown algae, which contributes to lead removal. The lead removal properties of cyanobacteria immobilized in calcium-alginate beads are being characterized for potential application in environmental lead removal.

"Bioethics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the ethics of science, medicine, and related research and technology. As each new development provokes further bioethical debate, the question arises as to the role of scientists in such debate. Currently, scientists do not o\xef\xac\x80er much beyond facts and research to bioethical debate, despite the fact that they have the most active role in the overall process. Few scientists have bioethics training, although the number is increasing. However, there is little requirement for or availability of such training at the undergraduate level. This talk presents a series of proposals to add bioethics to the science curriculum of Wellesley College, either by adding a bioethics requirement to the relevant majors, or, perhaps more e\xef\xac\x80ectively, by incorporating bioethics training into class curricula.

Money Matters (short talks) Pendleton East 339 Foreign Shocks and Domestic Policies: Evidence from Credit Default Swap Spreads Leslie Sheng Shen \xe2\x80\x9910, Economics and Political Science '"
"Since the onset of the era of \xef\xac\x81nancial globalization, emerging market economies have sharply increased their holding of inter-national reserves, from approximately 8% of their GDP in 1990 to almost 30% of GDP in recent years. One popular explanation for this development is that reserves can serve as a self-insurance tool to insulate domestic economies from foreign adverse shocks. As economies have become more \xef\xac\x81nancially integrated, the potential for sudden reversals in capital \xef\xac\x82ows and the international transmission of \xef\xac\x81nancial stress has increased as well. Therefore, it is especially important to assess the e\xef\xac\x80ectiveness of reserves as a self-insurance policy tool. This study empirically investigates whether countries with higher levels of reserve assets were able to better withstand the shock from the U.S. subprime crisis. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, we use sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) as an indicator of \xef\xac\x81nancial vulnerability and analyze the relationship between CDS spread movements and reserve accumulation. Who Owned Early Corporations? Wealth, Status, and Stockholding in the Early Nineteenth Century U.S.'"
"The proliferation of business corporations in the early nineteenth century transformed the American economy. Critics of these enterprises claimed that they were created and owned by wealthy elite, and served interests that were \xe2\x80\x9codious to the people.\xe2\x80\x9d But little is known about who actually owned shares in early corporations. Using lists of corporate shareholders collected from capital taxes imposed on corporations in New York, which were matched to early property tax records, I compare the wealth and status of those who owned stock in corporations to the general population both in 1791, when there were only two corporations in the state, and in 1826, when there were hundreds. The results shed light on the extent to which ordinary people participated in the pro\xef\xac\x81ts from corporations during this formative period in American history.

Theoretically, there are both costs (such as con\xef\xac\x82icts of interest) and bene\xef\xac\x81ts (such as the monitoring role the bankers could play) to bank board representation. Empirical research on Germany and Japan, where companies with close bank relationships depend heavily on banks for \xef\xac\x81nance, banks are represented on their boards, and lending banks are large shareholders, provide systematic evidence that bank representation has a positive e\xef\xac\x80ect on \xef\xac\x81rm performance. Just as German and Japanese banks are credited with the post-WWII industrial successes of their respective economies, banks in nineteenth century New England were a crucial part of its industrialization, and had close ties to industrial \xef\xac\x81rms.

Literature and the Arts Tango by Piazzolla: A Journey into the Life of Astor Piazzolla (performance) Jewett Auditorium'"
"Astor Piazzolla (March 11, 1921\xe2\x80\x93July 4, 1992) was an Argentine composer who wrote music for many di\xef\xac\x80erent instruments and ensembles. His compositions are known for their tango \xef\xac\x82are, but also incorporate classical and jazz elements. Some of his most important works for piano trio were his Four Seasons of Buenos Aires, Oblivion, and Muerte del Angel (Death of the Angel). The Four Seasons of Buenos Aires was meant as homage to Vivaldi\xe2\x80\x99s original Four Seasons, quoting from familiar pieces in the string repertoire. Oblivion is a short beautiful piece that has been featured in popular \xef\xac\x81lms and played all over the world.

"Estradiol is an ovarian steroid hormone essential to reproductive function and requisite to a variety of other biological processes. Its release is regulated by a cascade initiated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH itself is broken down by the neuropeptidases thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) and prolyl endopeptidase (PEP). We hypothesized that estradiol may directly or indirectly a\xef\xac\x80ect TOP and PEP, thereby re\xef\xac\x81ning control of GnRH activity.

"The steroid hormone testosterone has many important functions in males, including the development of sex organs, maturation of sperm, maintenance of the reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. Testosterone production in the testes is regulated by a well-established pathway, including positive and negative feedback within the pituitary and hypothalamus. However, other enzymes located in the testes may also regulate this pathway. One such enzyme is thimet oligopeptidase (TOP), an endopeptidase that hydrolyzes short peptides. TOP is found throughout the body, but is most catalytically active in the testes and brain. We hypothesized that changes in TOP activity could a\xef\xac\x80ect the production of testosterone. Our experiments showed that a speci\xef\xac\x81c TOP inhibitor a\xef\xac\x80ected circulating testosterone concentrations in male mice, as well as TOP activity in the testes and brain.

"hN1LNRA is the \xef\xac\x81rst of the three tandem Lin12/Notch Repeats in the human Notch1 receptor that regulates cell fate decisions.

The goal of this project is to investigate the role of calcium in stabilizing these disul\xef\xac\x81de bonds in the folded protein. Our hypothesis is that the amount of calcium in the environment will impact the minimum redox potential required to reduce hN1LNRA. To test this hypothesis we have exposed folded hN1LNRA in varying amounts of calcium under identical initial redox potential to increasing amounts of the reducing agent DTT under anaerobic conditions. We assayed samples at various time points using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and quanti\xef\xac\x81ed the ratio of folded vs. reduced protein to determine how the concentration of Ca2+ in the environment a\xef\xac\x80ected this ratio.

"Lack of oxygen in mammalian tissues can quickly lead to cell death. However, some ectotherms, including the gold\xef\xac\x81sh (Carassius auratus), can survive throughout the year in freshwater ponds that are highly variable in oxygen content. A number of studies have found that acclimation to low oxygen can increase an animal\xe2\x80\x99s tolerance to subsequent hypoxia exposure, while others have attributed to ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels the capacity to confer protection to cardiac muscle under those conditions. Our lab employed a quantitative PCR technique to study the molecular changes associated with regulatory and subunit proteins of KATP channels that may have cardioprotective roles under low oxygen conditions. Results using bactin1, arp and ubi as reference genes showed a clear up-regulation in the Kir6.2 subunit of KATP channels and a down-regulation in the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1a) regulatory protein in \xef\xac\x81sh acclimated to moderate hypoxia.

"Over 400 years, Martinique transformed from a slave-reliant colony to a fully equal French region. With colonization, the slave trade and the post-abolition immigration of Chinese and Indian workers, Martinique fostered the growth of a unique type of local medical practice. The valence in the contestation between local practices and the seeming scienti\xef\xac\x81c medicine and nursing practices of France shifted over time. Local Martinican and modern European medicines inevitably mixed, resulting in a hybrid more e\xef\xac\x80ective than either of the two were separately. The tension, mistrust, collaboration, and ultimate bene\xef\xac\x81ts of the interaction between the two types of medicine serve as an allegory for the rapport between France and Martinique. The two have been engaged in an uneven relation-ship of power: colonist and colonized, doctor and patient. Despite this imbalance they have united into a relatively stable and e\xef\xac\x80ective alliance, negotiating their di\xef\xac\x80erences and constructing a shared, trans-Atlantic identity.

"Principal events in Italian history, extending back as far as the Rinascimento, the Risorgimento, and the anti-fascist Resistenza, provide concrete examples of how the southern population has been largely excluded from participation in key historical movements before and after the formation of the nation. Continual isolation of southerners from integration with their northern counterparts has created an image of southern Italians as second-class citizens. Examination of the \xe2\x80\x9csouthern question\xe2\x80\x9d for my senior honors thesis will identify distinctive cultures, but will also illuminate many unifying features across the north/south gradient, dispelling some of the rooted stereotypes of southerners as \xe2\x80\x9cbackward,\xe2\x80\x9d inferior, and barbaric peoples.

Economic Issues Health, Education, and Welfare (short talks) Science Center 278 Trade Liberalization and Child Labor: Does Increase in Exports Decrease Child Labor? Afia Tasneem \xe2\x80\x9910, Economics '"
"Many developing countries with high levels of child labor have undergone trade liberalization in the last three decades and it has often been prescribed as a means of decreasing poverty in the long run. Increase in high skilled exports increase returns to education and can in\xef\xac\x82uence parents to substitute child labor for schooling. However, if parents send their children to work out of necessity or poverty, they will be present-biased and expectations of future income may not a\xef\xac\x80ect child labor. In theory, increase in low skilled exports both raises household income and child wages with ambiguous e\xef\xac\x80ects on child labor. This paper empirically explores the impact of trade liberalization in India in the 1990s. The study uses variation in exports in the districts of India to see its e\xef\xac\x80ects on the incidence of child labor and the subcategories of child labor: salaried work, work in house-hold enterprise, and domestic work. Contraceptive Choices and Consequences in Bangladesh and India'"
"A striking feature of fertility control in India is that 67% of women using contraception are sterilized, 34% of whom were sterilized by the age of 25. In contrast, oral contraceptives are the most popular contraceptive method in the neighboring country of Bangladesh, where only 5% of married women of reproductive age opt for sterilization. Contraceptives have a two-fold purpose\xe2\x80\x94 to limit births and to delay births. As female sterilization is an irreversible procedure, it can only be used to limit births. For this reason one would expect women to use spacing mechanisms in addition to sterilization. But very few Indian women do. In my thesis,  I explore the consequences of contraceptive method on the birth interval, which is the number of months between one birth and the next. The concern is that contraceptive choice may cause low birth intervals that then have adverse consequences for both mother and child.

"Among the many new burdens associated with climate change, droughts are increasing in many places around the world. Placed in light of our planet\xe2\x80\x99s exponentially increasing population, scarcity of water has left farmers and legislators at a loss for how to feed unmatched numbers. More than ever, there is an urgent need to \xef\xac\x81nd ways to produce larger yields of vital cereal crops. My project investigates the e\xef\xac\x80ectiveness of inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi to increase drought tolerance of spring wheat, also taking salinity stress from irrigation into account. Wheat plants were grown from seed under greenhouse conditions; after applying water and salt stress on the plants, I observed their overall health and speci\xef\xac\x81cally measured photosynthetic rate, height, and root biomass. It is my goal that this experiment will be useful in addressing the critical agricultural concerns of developing nations. Switchgrass and Climate Change'"
"Panicum virgatum, or switchgrass, is a biofuel crop candidate for North America. Although switchgrass tolerates a wide range of environmental conditions, a recent study found that switchgrass yields vary with \xef\xac\x82ooding and drought events. Drought events are becoming more frequent, according to regional climate models, and my research builds on this study to evaluate the factor of drought timing on switchgrass yields and growth. I conducted a greenhouse experiment to simulate the e\xef\xac\x80ect of early, mid- and late season drought periods on a common switchgrass cultivar, Cave-in-Rock, manipulating soil water potential to maintain drought-like conditions. I tracked various growth and development measurements from seedling and subsequent stages, and my results include \xef\xac\x81nal biomass yields, root:shoot ratio, and phenological data. Understanding how switchgrass, known for its hardiness and high yields, responds to the factor of drought timing is particularly relevant for climate change and biofuel e\xef\xac\x80orts. Native Bee Emergence and Climate Change'"
"Bee populations worldwide are in crisis, most likely due to pesticide use, introduced diseases and parasites, loss of habitat, and climate change. While the decline of the commercially valuable Apis mellifera, or Western honeybee, has been the subject of much research, little is known about the health of most native bee populations. Native bees are an integral part of New England ecosystems; they increase the yield of commercial crops such as blueberries, and they are superior pollinators of native plants. By tracking the arrival of native bee species to the Wellesley College campus and analyzing the emergence cues, overwintering habits, and generalist or specialist nature of those species, this research investigates the impacts of climate change, particularly the early arrival of spring, on the emergence of native bees.

"Invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity and oceanic island systems such as the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos are particularly threatened by introductions of exotic species. Population genetics can determine invasive potential of recently introduced populations through evaluation of the remaining genetic variation and heterozygosity. This study focuses on the winged Galapaganus howdenae, a weevil species recently introduced to Santa Cruz Island in Gal\xc3\xa1pagos. Because microsatellite DNA loci, regions of hypervariable repeats, are highly variable co-dominant neutral genetic markers, they are particularly powerful tools for this type of study. Genotyping of multiple individuals across various loci and localities will allow detection of demographic expansion and genetic diversity retention. Results of this study will not only identify these introduced populations\xe2\x80\x99 invasive potential, but could also provide guidance concerning steps needed to prevent further expansion into native habitats and contribute to the conservation of Gal\xc3\xa1pagos\xe2\x80\x99 biodiversity.

"Unless immediately deterred, the processes of ecological change currently underway in the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos archipelago may lead to the loss of populations, extinction of species and disruption of evolutionary processes and ecosystems. Although a number of forces contribute to ecological change, habitat destruction and fragmentation marks the greatest threat to both species and habitat diversity. Loss of habitat connectivity results in reduced migration rates, causing remnant populations to become isolated and susceptible to extinction. This project will study patterns of genetic variability of weevil populations across volcanoes in the island of Isabela in the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos.

One of the greatest bene\xef\xac\x81ts of this culturally rich community is the multilingualism that \xef\xac\x82ourishes on campus. International students contribute largely to the list of languages spoken between students, while American students bring a di\xef\xac\x80erent bilingual back-ground to school. Does this di\xef\xac\x80erence change their attitudes or the linguistic aspects of their future? In a sociolinguistic study, young international and domestic bilingual college students responded to a survey that examined their language experience, learning processes, usage, and skill. These results were used to measure attitudes about being bilingual leading to some surprising but pleasant discoveries. Am I Getting Old or Are You Being Sarcastic?'"
"Sarcastic humor is popular with the young, who sometimes \xef\xac\x81nd that their jokes are misunderstood by older individuals. This study was designed to examine how well adults (over 40) and young adults (between the ages of 18\xe2\x80\x9325) detect the use of sarcasm in casual conversation. A survey, which contained questions on participants\xe2\x80\x99 background and use of sarcasm and \xef\xac\x81ve brief dialogs that were evaluated for sarcasm, was conducted to explore this question. Responses were collected from over 30 participants. The results reveal some interesting patterns that link the detection of sarcasm to age di\xef\xac\x80erences. They also provide some insight as to why we think we\xe2\x80\x99re funny, but many of our parents tend to think otherwise.

"Relatively few women choose science majors or careers in science, and women who do work in male-dominated \xef\xac\x81elds, such as science, continue to hit that infamous glass ceiling, hindering them in their attempts to advance in their careers. While more women than ever before have entered into science \xef\xac\x81elds, the presence of gender related stereotypes may still be widespread and problematic. In our study, we investigated whether people associate masculine traits more than feminine traits with a successful scientist.

Expectations for Relationships among College Aged Women:  Do our Parent\xe2\x80\x99s Relationships Shape Our Own?'"
"The average age of marriage continues to rise and the divorce rate in America remains just below 50%. Yet, why these trends continue or what people of marriageable age think about these phenomena remains under explored. In my thesis I study college-aged women and their expectations for their future relationships. My working hypothesis has been that children of divorce, regardless of their socioeconomic background, are more likely to have polarized expectations regarding their relationships: they are more likely to be completely commitment-averse or commitment-demanding; they are more likely to have thought about divorce in their futures (either as a de\xef\xac\x81nite occurrence or a complete impossibility); they are less likely to believe in \xe2\x80\x9cthe one\xe2\x80\x9d (i.e, a soul mate); and they are more likely to expect a partner to break o\xef\xac\x80 a relationship unless they are shown complete and absolute devotion. Early analysis of focus group data with 29 women\xe2\x80\x9410 whose parents are divorce, 10 who identify their parents as happily married, and 9 who identify their parents as unhappily married\xe2\x80\x94reveals that women whose parents are unhappily married or divorced have more clearly de\xef\xac\x81ned future plans and are more pessimistic about eventually \xef\xac\x81nding someone with whom they can spend their entire lives. They also tend to be more aware of their parent\xe2\x80\x99s relationships and see their parents as an example for their own relationships. Simultaneously, many appear resigned to future relationships that will resemble those of their parents in some aspects. I conclude with an examination of the implications of my \xef\xac\x81ndings and what they may portend for the future of marriage in the U.S. Personality, Self, and  Relationship Attitudes Colette Whitaker \xe2\x80\x9910, Psychology and Computer Science '"
"For the psychology research methods course, 312R, students designed and ran studies in the \xef\xac\x81eld of personality psychology. This study examines positive illusions in relationships between romantic partners and close friends, as well as the relationship between illusions and other relationship variables. The \xe2\x80\x9clove-is-blind\xe2\x80\x9d bias is the primary construct of interest; this is an illusion in which individuals perceive their romantic partners to be more attractive than them. A sample of 141 women estimated their own, their romantic partner\xe2\x80\x99s, and a close friend\xe2\x80\x99s physical attractiveness. Participants also completed measures of relationship satisfaction and love styles. Results provided support for the love-is-blind bias and a positive illusion in friendships, in that individuals consistently rated their partners more positively themselves, and their close friends more attractive than average. Results also show a positive correlation between the love-is-bias and the love styles, Eros (romantic love) and Agape (sel\xef\xac\x82ess love).

Gender Differences in the Association between Childhood Obesity and Behavior Problems in a Pre-K Sample Becky Parker \xe2\x80\x9910, Psychology '"
"Childhood obesity rates in the U.S. are remarkably high. While physical health problems related to obesity need much attention, there are psychosocial problems that can severely impact a person\xe2\x80\x99s quality of life as well. Research indicates that women more frequently than men experience low status attainment and depressive symptoms as a result of weight-related stigmatization and social marginalization. When and why does this gender di\xef\xac\x80erence in psychosocial problems arise? Because patterns in behavioral problems associated with childhood obesity are emerging at very young ages, it is important that research and intervention focus not only on adolescents but also children in preschool. My research addresses some of the gender di\xef\xac\x80erences in overweight children, the behavioral problems that may lead to increased social marginalization, and the frequency of these behavior problems in young boys and girls.

This project will analyze data collected for 1660 households in rural Honduras, focusing on variables that proxy social capital, including responses to questions about trust, group participation, networking, and community involvement. I will estimate statistical models using Stata software to test hypotheses about how individual and family characteristics such as income and education levels of adults in the household contribute to social capital in the rural Honduran context.

"Women of all ages have been found to suppress their authentic thoughts and feelings in order to maintain good relationships. In my research, I predict that college women will demonstrate lower levels of authenticity if they have a history of child maltreatment. I also predict that authenticity will partially account for the negative outcomes that develop from child maltreatment, including depression, low self-esteem, and trauma symptomatology. Furthermore, I propose that Asian American women will exhibit worse outcomes compared to other ethnic groups as a result of the greater prevalence of child maltreatment and self-silencing among Asian Americans. Mother-Daughter Dyads:  From Cultural Discontinuities to Shared Perspectives'"
"In the U.S., Latina adolescents often face problems of acculturation, that is, adaptation to two cultures simultaneously. In addition to typical developmental challenges, they must integrate into mainstream American culture while maintaining a connection to their parents\xe2\x80\x99 traditional ethnic values. Clinicians and researchers have begun to document the negative outcomes associated with acculturative stress as well as the bene\xef\xac\x81cial e\xef\xac\x80ects of mutual relationships on family functioning and self-esteem. This presentation summarizes the \xef\xac\x81ndings of my thesis research on the association between the shared understanding of cultural knowledge within the mother-daughter relationship and indicators of psychological well-being in a sample of 92 Latina adolescents.

"Following a 1992 recommendation from the O\xef\xac\x83ce of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, gender-speci\xef\xac\x81c programming was championed as the golden solution to reducing at-risk behavior in young girls. Youth organizations across the country adopted this framework acknowledging that girls\xe2\x80\x99 development is unique from boys and furthermore that speci\xef\xac\x81c intervention is necessary to promote healthy adolescence. In fall 2009, I researched this phenomenon both through a literature review and interviews with two Latina community based organizations in Boston. These organizations incorporate Latina cultural values such as familismo and collectivismo into the gender-speci\xef\xac\x81c model to encourage positive identity formation and deter risky behavior in girls ages eleven to seventeen. I examined how the program content aims to reduce the risk of pregnancy, low high school graduation rate, and suicide/depression in Latina youth. I also questioned how the lack of adequate program evaluation impacts the long-term success of behavioral risk aversion.

"From expression of love to obtaining a promotion, women are motivated to have sex for many di\xef\xac\x80erent reasons.

Goals, Close Relationships, and the Self Krista Olson \xe2\x80\x9911, Psychology '"
"How important are signi\xef\xac\x81cant others to our goals? Relationships with romantic others and close friends have been shown to impact how an individual views themselves, others, and the environment. Close others have also been shown to impact goal pursuits positively and negatively. This presentation will discuss my study on the relationships among goals, close relationships, and relational identity orientation. For this study, college undergraduates and faculty completed \xef\xac\x81ve questionnaires that measured how much romantic others and close friends helped or in\xef\xac\x82uenced goals, the importance of achievement goals, relationship closeness, and the subjective importance of social relationships. Understanding the importance of close friends and romantic partners in our lives can help us gain a fuller picture of how this aspect of the self is impacted by interpersonal relations. This presentation will further discuss the constructs mentioned above and the results of the study.

"Beginning on the First Sunday in Advent in 1964, the Catholic Mass underwent a transformation from the traditional, sacred Latin to what some would call the \xe2\x80\x9cheavenly hootenanny.\xe2\x80\x9d In addition to the most obvious changes in the Mass, Vatican II brought about many other changes in the Catholic Church. Lay people were expected to take an active role in the Church rather than being passive recipients of the sacraments; sacramentals, religious devotions, and even some saints were no longer considered as integral. These changes greatly impacted Catholics and their beliefs. I will discuss what I learned through my independent study in the religion department about these changes,  as set out by Vatican II and as interpreted by various segments of the Church, and consider their impact on Catholics and the Catholic Church.

Becoming More Buddhist over Time: An Analysis of the Ambedkar Conversion Movement in India'"
"Asia Studies The Ambedkar conversion movement, which began in 1956, has seen generations of Hindu Untouchables convert to Buddhism. Drawing upon interviews conducted in the converted community over two research trips to Nagpur, India, I have examined the evolution of the Ambedkar Buddhist movement as a process that is characterized by stages of change over time. In my research, I have observed the ways in which conversion is an ongoing process through the converts\xe2\x80\x99 acceptance of the Triratna, or Three Jewels\xe2\x80\x94the Buddha, Dhamma (teachings of the Buddha), and Sangha (Buddhist community).

"For incoming undergraduates, college represents an important but often challenging transition.

Alumni Giving: Altruism or Self-interest? Caitlin Kearns \xe2\x80\x9910, Economics '"
"A number of researchers have examined the determinants of alumni donations, many motivated by concern for the \xef\xac\x81nancial stability of higher education institutions. In contrast, Meer and Rosen (2009) marry a study of altruistic giving with higher education \xef\xac\x81nance, using institutional data to disentangle the relative importance of sel\xef\xac\x81shness and altruism as determinants of alumni giving. The research presented here addresses the same question asked by Meer and Rosen: whether donations to one\xe2\x80\x99s alma mater are motivated by altruistic factors or by the desire to increase children\xe2\x80\x99s probability of admission. Data from a single-sex institution, however, provides a natural control group, allowing the same estimation to be made more precisely and with less risk of endogeneity.

"The name and writings of Shakespeare carry with them considerable power. From the late eighteenth century on, women have appropriated his cultural authority to give credence to their otherwise unconventional roles as scholars, critics, and public performers, asserting a uniquely female intuitive and emotional connection to the Bard. This gendered approach allowed them to enter into competition with their male counterparts and to raise serious social and political questions; however, it sometimes came dangerously close to rea\xef\xac\x83rming the essentialist stereotypes that limited women\xe2\x80\x99s power and authority in the real world. Wellesley College, from its founding a remarkable community of female Shakespeare scholars, soon became a site of tension between essentialism and experimentation as the students of the Shakespeare Society clashed with professors and administrators over the extent and nature of its dramatic performances, in which young women adopted male dress and manners.'"

Indeed, that was the question on Barbara Ruhlman\xe2\x80\x99s mind throughout much of the year. Once the day of the conference had arrived, however, a new question had come to occupy their minds: What if no one attends? The conference had been organized into concurrent sessions scheduled from 3\xe2\x80\x937pm and, because no change to the class schedule was made that day, late-afternoon classes overlapped with the first block of conference presentations. At a place already overpopulated with lectures, performances and other community events, who would be interested in attending yet another optional event? Many were. The student, faculty and staff turnout that afternoon was respectable, if not large, and faculty and staff outnumbered students in most sessions. Of greater significance, both those who presented and those who attended the first conference left with the impression that they had participated in something special, urging those in charge of planning the conference to find ways to increase involvement among all constituencies of the College.

Why was the Ruhlman Conference such a success? A student on the first program committee for the conference provided insight into that question when she suggested that \xe2\x80\x9cWellesley was a very academic place, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as intellectual as it might be.\xe2\x80\x9d By that I believe she meant that Wellesley students set high academic standards for themselves and their peers, that they worked hard to achieve those standards\xe2\x80\x94but that they spend more time talking about how hard they work than about what they are working on. Although the Ruhlman Conference provided a venue to applaud and celebrate the hard work necessary to produce excellent projects, its focus was on the results of that hard work\xe2\x80\x94the knowledge, understanding, and joy that comes through serious intellectual engagement. If asked to describe how the conference has changed over time, most would probably say that the presentations have gotten better (more polished and professional) and that the audience has grown larger and more diverse (students, faculty and staff being joined by a growing number of family members, friends and alumnae). These changes aside, many qualities of the Ruhlman Conference have remained constant: the opportunity for students to present their work (often for the first time) to a large and varied audience; the justifiable pride students feel in demonstrating their depth of knowledge of a particular subject; the inspiration these presentations serve for students new to the College; and the occasion for all members of the Wellesley community to observe the immense range of intellectual work being done across the campus. Ten years later, it is not difficult to see why the Ruhlman Conference has become such a valued Wellesley tradition. Lee Cuba is William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Sociology and former Dean of the College. While Associate Dean, he worked with Barbara Ruhlman to develop the plan for the Ruhlman Conference and chaired the program committee from 1997\xe2\x80\x931999. On the occasion of the 10th annual Ruhlman conference, Lee Cuba (one of the instigators of the original conference, the other being Barbara Ruhlman) wrote that the conference was an instant success and quickly became a valued Wellesley tradition. As we celebrate the 15th anniversary, it is hard to imagine Wellesley without the Ruhlman Conference. It is built into our calendar and our consciousness. Students look forward to their presentations as they plan their research projects. Faculty mark the years by remembering which students participated in a Ruhlman panel or poster session. Deans describe the conference to candidates for faculty positions as one of the great selling points of the institution. Other colleges planning student research conferences look enviously at the structure we have built. Part of the joy of the day is the way in which traditional divisions are broken down. Science talks happen in Pendleton, poetry readings in the Science Center. Panels are created that cross disciplines and make new connections; the audiences are filled with staff, faculty, and students interacting with the presenters and with one another in new ways. And part of the joy comes from Barbara Ruhlman\xe2\x80\x99s obvious delight in her creation. The gratitude that flows back and forth between her and the students adds to the special nature of the day and is a manifestation of the connections among generations of Wellesley alumnae.'"

"Education Social injustice and inequality pervade the world and attempts at reform and development never seem to reach the core of the problem or find a solution. Education has long been considered a means of empowerment and a method to provide equal access, but what happens when education is in fact perpetuating inequality? The issue of education inequity in the United States and abroad provides an insight into the perseverance of structural violence in the sociopolitical arena. The practices of education today often create an access gap that hinders society from reaching a more equitable and democratic reality. Through the narratives of children in the U.S. and across the world, the detrimental effects of structural violence in education are realized. In turn, a hope for a movement towards peace education and the establishment of structural liberty can be realized.

The Hidden Role of Emotion in Linguistic Relativity: A Comparative Study on the Effect of Native Language on Visual-emotional Associations Ran Wei \xe2\x80\x9913, Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences and German Studies'"
"Linguistic relativism is the theory that an individual\xe2\x80\x99s perception of the world is influenced by his or her native language. Among linguists, this theory is generally preferred to linguistic determinism, a more radical theory asserting that the native language not only influences but also restrains thoughts. Neither theory, however, speaks directly of emotion, a crucial but often ignored factor in psycholinguistic research. In this study, I argue that emotion is an area where most differences can occur between two languages, and that a theory of linguistic determinism or relativism would be incomplete without considering it. While preferring linguistic relativism in general, I argue that linguistic determinism must be upheld to some degree when emotion is taken into consideration. To support this claim, a survey was conducted to show that native Chinese speakers and native English speakers have different visual-emotional associations due to language differences.

"Antimicrobial peptides are short polypeptide sequences that present promising targets for therapeutic developments. While many peptides kill bacteria through generalized membrane disruption, some peptides cross the cell membrane and kill through interaction with intracellular components. Based on properties of some well-studied peptides that cross membranes, the Elmore lab has designed three novel antimicrobial peptides. These peptides have proven active against a range of bacteria, but it is unknown whether their similarities to known peptides mean that they are using the same mechanism of action. One important characteristic in the design of the novel peptides was the inclusion of a helix-breaking proline residue. My research focuses on the importance of this residue on the processes of membrane permeabilization and the ultimate effect of the residue on antimicrobial activity.

"Antimicrobial peptides are a component of the innate immune system in all living organisms, offering the potential for a resistance-free clinical substitution of current antibacterial treatments. Previous work in the Elmore lab focused on a histone-derived antimicrobial peptide buforin II. We are expanding on this research and considering hipposin, a related peptide isolated from the Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus. Hipposin is longer than buforin II, and includes the sequence of buforin flanked by two additional sequences. Because proline is a critical component of the buforin primary sequence, we are working with peptide mutants to determine the importance of proline residues in hipposin. Our projects begin a dual-approach investigation of hipposin, focusing on its antibacterial and anti-cancer activities. We have observed increased efficacy of proline mutants in tumor cells, with the opposite effect in bacteria.

From Sand to Sky: Using Spectroscopy to See Clearly (short talks) Science Center 396 The Ultraviolet Spectrum of the Eclipsing Binary System 22 Vul Lamiya Mowla \xe2\x80\x9913, Astrophysics'"
"We have used data from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer satellite to study the eclipse of the binary system 22 Vul. The binary system has a cool G-type supergiant with an extended atmosphere and a smaller but hotter B-type main sequence star, which undergoes eclipses. As the hot star goes in and out of eclipse behind the supergiant, its light shines through the cool atmosphere, and the spectrum produced is observed by FUSE. We have identified the different elements producing the absorption lines seen outside total eclipse and observed how the lines change over the different phases of the eclipse. As the hot star gets farther out of eclipse, the absorption features get weaker. The strength of the absorption features produced has been used to study the structure of the cool supergiant wind.

"The quantitative analysis of atmospheric physics and chemistry requires accurate and complete molecular spectroscopic data. Additionally, the interpretation of astronomical spectroscopic observations directly relies on the breadth and precision of the data available for atomic and molecular processes. This presentation describes two projects on sulfur-bearing molecules: the design, construction, and modeling of a furnace to be used in obtaining diatomic sulfur (S2) spectra, and the collection and analysis of sulfur dioxide (SO2) spectra. These projects provide insight into the electronic structure of these molecules and contribute to the understanding of their roles in the photochemistry of sulfur-rich planetary atmospheres.

Quantifying the Composition of a Mixed Carbonate-Siliciclastic Sand Matrix: A Comparative Study between XRD, XRF, and Point Counting Methodology Laura Ann Stevens \xe2\x80\x9911, Geosciences'"
"The composition of beach sands is often used to interpret source and transport of sediment in the coastal zone. A methods study was used to question whether the geochemical analysis methods of X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) can be successfully applied to determine the mineral composition of mixed siliciclastic-carbonate beaches in comparison to the traditional point counting method. Test sands comprised of quartz, coral fragments, shells, amphibole, and magnetite from Vieques, Puerto Rico were used. The range of grain sizes and differential weathering patterns of minerals in the sands complicates analytical methods. Analysis of error in each of the three methods was informed by a calibration study of sands comprised of known quantities of quartz and carbonate. Modifications on the traditional point counting method have produced an improved methodology, which incorporates the strengths of both the chemical and traditional analysis methods while also minimizing overall analytical expenditure.

"Cetaceans (e.g., whales, dolphins, porpoises) present a developmental enigma. Their ancestors were limbed terrestrial mammals, but during development, cetaceans first build and then lose their hind limbs and radically modify their vertebral columns. This project uses prenatal cetacean specimens from museum collections to examine this developmental transformation. DNA sequencing was used to confirm the species identity of museum specimens. A data set of external prenatal morphology and size by age was assembled from the whaling and scientific literature, allowing estimation of gestational age. CT scans performed at Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital documented the morphology of the developing osteological tissues by generating images using software that allows density-based differential coloring. This project is interdisciplinary in its use of historical whaling records, genetics, developmental biology, and medical imaging techniques. Do Muscles Make a Good Swimmer? Linking Fish Form and Fitness Kara Feilich \xe2\x80\x9911, Biological Sciences'"
"If speciation were happening at Wellesley, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want to know? Sometimes, a single population may exhibit different body forms in different environments. If these alternate forms are adapted to their specific environments, this may further their divergence and they may someday split into new species. Bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) in Lake Waban exhibit such anatomical differentiation, with shallow and open-water fishes having slightly different forms. These two forms also exhibit adaptive differences in swimming performance in their respective habitats. I examined the functional morphology of shallow and open-water bluegill, to determine if specific differences in internal morphology contribute to adaptive performance differences.

"Many insects undergo metamorphosis where a larva transforms into a pupa and subsequently an adult. While many insects develop their adult legs from internal tissues called imaginal discs, more basal insects develop their adult appendages from external larval legs. Although the mechanism underlying leg development in highly derived insects is well understood, that governing adult leg transformation in more basal insects is not clear. To investigate the mechanism underlying larval to adult leg transformation in basal insects, leg development in the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, was examined through functional studies of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and the TGF-\xce\xb2 family member dpp. Knockdown phenotypes strongly suggested that both Arm and Dpp are key regulators of postembryonic leg development. Unexpectedly, dpp knockdown also resulted in severe bodily clearing, indicating that dpp is also for fat metabolism.

Impact of Habitat Fragmentation on Genetic Structure of Endemic Weevil Populations in the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos Archipelago Weixia Guo \xe2\x80\x9911, Biological Sciences'"
"Habitat fragmentation, one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, is defined as the division of one continuous habitat into multiple smaller patches. As a result of the barriers to gene flow created by uninhabitable areas between patches, populations of organisms become at risk of losing genetic variability and possible extinction. By using genetic markers to measure genetic variability, we aim to evaluate the impact of habitat fragmentation on the endemic weevil Galapaganus conwayensis on the island of Isabela and compare to those on Santa Cruz and Pinta. The results of this study will yield valuable insight into the impact on other species facing habitat fragmentation. (Research supported by the National Science Foundation and Wellesley College.)

Baker \xe2\x80\x9911, Economics and Religion'"
"Recessions have many effects on society, but few are as poorly understood as those on workers nearing retirement age. Although popular media portrayals claim that older workers choose to delay retirement in order to recoup lost stock market savings and home equity, research shows that they may not have this choice. The weak labor markets that typically accompany recessions often compel older workers out of the labor force, effectively forcing them to retire. This research examines the effects of weak labor markets on retiree happiness. Evaluating the \xe2\x80\x9cSpare Tire\xe2\x80\x9d Hypothesis: The Role of Capital Markets in Reducing Output Losses of Financial Crises Tess DeLean \xe2\x80\x9911, Economics'"
"The financial crisis of 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 has underscored the need to better understand how countries can withstand the repercussions of such events. Among the theories concerned with this issue is the \xe2\x80\x9cspare tire\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesis proposed by Alan Greenspan, former Chair of the Federal Reserve System. Greenspan claimed that capital markets could act as a \xe2\x80\x9cspare tire\xe2\x80\x9d in intermediating funds between households and firms in the event of a bank crisis. This research investigates this hypothesis by examining whether countries with active capital markets are better equipped to withstand the negative effects of financial crises as measured by output losses. As a secondary hypothesis, this research also investigates whether the openness of domestic capital markets to foreign investors affects the ability of these markets to reduce output losses. Greed in the Law: An Examination of Moral Discourse in American Legal Proceedings Nan McGarry \xe2\x80\x9911, Sociology'"
"As the stock market began to decline in 2008, a moral discourse condemning greed emerged powerfully in both the public and private domains of American society. Phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cBrown blames \xe2\x80\x98unchecked greed\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d filled headlines as the public demanded a moral accounting of events which would explain the chaos. The rational legal process would also become inflated with this cultural discourse. Judges admonished defendants for \xe2\x80\x9cpursuing greed for greed\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d while applying harsher sentences for crimes \xe2\x80\x9cmotivated solely by greed.\xe2\x80\x9d How can we understand this phenomenon?

"Political violence impacts human, natural, and physical capital in destructive ways. It hinders economic and social development, as well as undermines the security of the individuals, communities, nations, and countries.

This thesis traces the very early development of modern tools of fiscal management in China\xe2\x80\x99s Northern Song Dynasty (960\xe2\x80\x931127). Under the pressure of war, the Song state developed a mix of market and non-market approaches to maximize its ability to siphon cash revenue from the trade in major commodities. This remarkable process will be compared to a similar expansion of corporations under the pressure of war financing in early modern Europe over 600 years later. (Research supported by a Jerome A.

"This presentation examines the use of bioethical guidelines in discussions of medical research by Indian civil society. In 2009, an American NGO began conducting a HPV vaccination program in rural India. During the course of this program, six girls died and their parents blamed the vaccine.

"Governments take different approaches to poverty alleviation in every country, influenced by their histories, institutional frameworks, and systems of governance.

"The twin concepts of civil society and NGOs have attracted much scholarly attention in recent years. Literature on these topics has flourished among Western and non-Western academics alike. However, NGO activity in developing countries with undemocratic governments is testing the link between civil society and democracy traditionally espoused by western scholars, leading to a new body of comparative literature that questions traditional assumptions about the role of civil society and democratization. My research seeks to bring China into the debate by examining ongoing NGO activity amidst China\xe2\x80\x99s unique political environment, analyzing the impact of NGOs on civil society development in China, and then using the information to question assumptions surrounding civil society.

"Studies An estimated 250 million people will flee their homes by 2050, their survival endangered by the drought, sea level rise, and storm surges caused by global climate change. These climate migrants must forge new lives in unfamiliar cities or even foreign countries because of their vulnerability to this human-caused environmental disaster. Using trends derived from past mass migrations, this presentation will follow the likely path of climate migrants as they depart the most vulnerable hotspots in the developing world, and will offer policy solutions to relieve or prepare predicted destinations. But who will act? The equation measuring responsibility to protect is unequal: those most at risk to migrate live in developing countries like Bangladesh, whereas those with the greatest historical responsibility for climate change live in industrialized countries like the United States. Whatever the answer, there is no question the international community must protect this emergent category of forced migrants.

"Nefertari, chief wife to Ramesses the Great, is often regarded as one of the most beautiful and beloved queens of ancient Egypt. Her unusually large, lavishly decorated tomb in the Valley of the Queens has been called the Sistine Chapel of Ancient Egypt. Throngs of visitors and lack of maintenance during the early twentieth century, however, have led to the tomb\xe2\x80\x99s rapid and disfiguring deterioration. This presentation will discuss the various efforts, successful and unsuccessful, that have been made to restore and maintain Nefertari\xe2\x80\x99s tomb, including the most recent international effort by the Getty Conservation Institute and the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. It will also explore the debates about cultural heritage and patrimony that these conservation efforts engender; the natural and man-made forces that result in the deterioration of art and monuments; and the urgent problems facing Egyptian antiquities at the present moment.

"For centuries, Western churches have been hiring artists to decorate sacred houses of worship with biblical images and Christian iconography. However, from the Renaissance to the modern era there have been dramatic changes in the formal and stylistic practices used by artists to illustrate religious themes. The growing prevalence of abstract art in church ornamentation impels examination of two possible causal factors: a relaxation in the specificity of patron-artist contracts over time, and the Church\xe2\x80\x99s changing attitude regarding the acceptance of avant-garde art. This presentation will address historical shifts in church decoration by comparing Italian Renaissance works such as Domenico Ghirlandaio\xe2\x80\x99s Adoration of the Magi (1488) with Henri Matisse\xe2\x80\x99s designs for the Chapelle du Rosaire in Vence, France (1949\xe2\x80\x931951).

"Many men throughout history have been characterized by their facial hair, though perhaps none as ubiquitously as Salvador Dal\xc3\xad. A self-described genius, Dal\xc3\xad used the iconic power of his mustache to craft an exterior identity that intrigued, confounded, and inspired his adoring public. His self-professed personality became a work of art and a promotional tool that simultaneously explained and mystified the secret behind his paintings. In 1954, he published Dali\xe2\x80\x99s Mustache, a photographic \xe2\x80\x9cinterview\xe2\x80\x9d featuring farcical images of his facial hair that responded to questions about his life and philosophy. Marking the complete conflation of his persona and his mustache, the book cemented Dal\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x99s iconic status in the eyes of the American public. While Dal\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x99s celebrity places him in dialogue with other famous artists, notably Gustave Courbet and Andy Warhol, he is set apart by his strategic self-promotion and its continued effect on criticism of his work.

"The Hong Kong contemporary art scene has gained increasing prominence in light of the 1997 handover, the recent remarkable market success of Chinese contemporary art, and the upcoming construction of a two-billion-USD contemporary art museum. My senior thesis investigates the physical and political spaces of Hong Kong contemporary art, including the operation and negotiation between government-funded and independent arts organizations, between these organizations and individual artists, and between national apparatuses like Hong Kong Museum of Art and international venues such as the Venice Biennale. Institutions are essential to artists because they provide them with exhibition and studio space, an expensive commodity in the super-dense Hong Kong. By accepting government funding and space contributions, artists face the challenge of compromising their creative freedom. Independent organizations must find ingenious ways to survive. On the global stage, Hong Kong contemporary art is quickly gaining followers for its innovation and creativity at both the institutional and individual levels and for its rapid construction of new art spaces.

"Why write literature? This question poses a central and complex problem for Marcel Proust in his novel In Search of Lost Time. I attempt to unlock Proust\xe2\x80\x99s answer to this question by examining how one of his novels\xe2\x80\x99 defining images\xe2\x80\x94the cathedral\xe2\x80\x94structures the Proustian relationship between a writer\xe2\x80\x99s life and his literature. The cathedral has different meanings in Proust\xe2\x80\x99s novel; in particular, it is a work of art, a testament to time, a scaffolding for memories, and a burial vault for the deceased. As such, the cathedral serves Proust as an architectural prototype for his novel: a literary edifice that doubles as the author\xe2\x80\x99s tomb. I will show that In Search of Lost Time stands not as a memorial to Proust\xe2\x80\x99s past, but as a monument to his transfiguration and afterlife; in short, Proust\xe2\x80\x99s novel is his cathedral. A Voice of Reason and Intimacy: The Female Confidante in the Tragedies of Jean Racine Melody Pao \xe2\x80\x9911, French'"
"Though scholars have often overlooked the confidante in the tragedies of Jean Racine, my senior thesis sheds light on this character\xe2\x80\x99s essential role within four of the playwright\xe2\x80\x99s canonical works. As the voice of reason, the confidante counters the heroine\xe2\x80\x99s passion and completes the defining paradox of Racine\xe2\x80\x99s works\xe2\x80\x94order within chaos. As a figure of intimacy, the confidante gives voice to the heroine\xe2\x80\x99s suffering and moves the audience to tears, thereby marking the tragedy\xe2\x80\x99s success. I will analyze the confidantes who fulfill this dual role and those who deviate from the norm. To underscore her importance, I will also compare her to the male confidant, who, in contrast, stands as a one-dimensional voice of the public sphere. This nuanced portrait of the confidante will reveal her crucial role within the structure of the Racinian tragedy, and offer a new understanding of so-called minor characters on the tragic stage. Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s Decision: The Ethics of Virtue and Utilitarianism in George Eliot\xe2\x80\x99s Daniel Deronda Flannery Wheeler \xe2\x80\x9911, English'"
"The conclusion of Daniel Deronda has long puzzled George Eliot scholars. I think, however, it constitutes an attempt to answer the novel\xe2\x80\x99s central moral question: whether, if possible, one ought to \xe2\x80\x9curge wider changes for good\xe2\x80\x9d (Middlemarch 365) if doing so would harm one\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnearest neighbor\xe2\x80\x9d (M 693)\xe2\x80\x94whether, that is, one should subscribe to a utilitarian or a virtue-centered moral philosophy. Although the novel ostensibly supports Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s decision, a more Feuerbachian reading of the text complicates this conclusion and suggests, for Eliot, our duties toward individuals ultimately eclipse our duties toward a more abstract humanity at large. Living in Absurdity Olivia Kingsley \xe2\x80\x9911, English'"
"In 1958, the playwright Harold Pinter wrote that his piece The Birthday Party \xe2\x80\x9cis a comedy because the whole state of affairs is absurd and inglorious. It is, however, as you know, a very serious piece of work.\xe2\x80\x9d Pinter, like his ideological peers Eug\xc3\xa8ne Ionesco and Samuel Beckett, pioneered a new kind of drama and a new kind of humor. Though many would describe plays like Beckett\xe2\x80\x99s Waiting for Godot to be bleak or inaccessible, in fact these playwrights draw upon a long tradition of slapstick, silent film, and verbal comedy, providing comic relief that enriches the implicit philosophical content of their works. The humor of the avant-garde \xe2\x80\x9ctheater of the absurd,\xe2\x80\x9d as it is sometimes called, stands apart from its predecessors, maintaining its startling, provocative impact on audiences to this day.

"Local field potentials (LFPs), or the postsynaptic electrical activity of groups of neurons in a particular region of brain tissue, can quantify neural activity of that area in response to a stimulus. It has been determined that rats exhibit certain characteristic \xe2\x80\x9cbumps\xe2\x80\x9d in their LFPs while listening to a pattern of beeps known as the passive oddball paradigm, where a repeating tone is periodically replaced by a different pitch \xe2\x80\x9coddball\xe2\x80\x9d beep. In our study, the oddball beep was found to elicit greater amplitude LFP responses in the rat frontal and parietal cortices, even in controls that reversed the pitches of the two tones. These results indicate that the heightened response to infrequent stimuli was attentional and not pitch-related. Future work will investigate whether neural synchrony, which has been linked to attention in primates, occurs in these frontal and parietal responses.

"My research investigates the effect of nitric oxide (NO) on adult neurogenesis, the lifelong production of new neurons. While NO is involved in brain pathologies, it is also involved in normal physiological functions, for example in the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), invoking a wide array of cellular responses. My experiments show that NOS (nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme that contributes to the production of NO) immunoreactivity in the crayfish species Procambarus clarkii increases with bilateral ablation of the antennules. Increased levels of NO are associated with significantly decreased levels of neurogenesis in the crayfish brain. Using immunocytochemical and confocal imaging techniques to map changes in the brain, the aim of my research is to test a potential push-pull mechanism on adult neurogenesis in P. clarkii between NO and serotonin, a neurotransmitter which can up-regulate neuronal proliferation.

Rachel Kery \xe2\x80\x9912 Neuroscience and Anthropology, and Julia Gall \xe2\x80\x9912, Neuroscience'"
"Adult neurogenesis, the production of new neurons in adult brains, occurs in olfactory pathways of decapod crustaceans. In Procambarus clarkii, new neurons are born in the neurogenic niche, where neural progenitor cells divide symmetrically and both daughter cells migrate along glial strands to clusters 9 and 10. Divisions of existing niche cells do not replenish the niche, but the niche increases in size over an animal\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime. Niche precursor cells must, therefore, originate from an outside source. It has been hypothesized that circulating stem cells of possible hematopoietic origin are migrating into the niche from the hemolymph, and previous lines of inquiry have suggested a relationship between cells circulating in the blood and niche cells in the brain. In an attempt to better define this relationship, we examined the effect of hematopoietic tissue removal on neurogenesis. The numbers of cells in cluster 10 were significantly reduced (p=0.0002) relative to control and sham treatment groups. The differences in numbers of cells in the niche, though not significant, still suggest a possible relationship, which we will pursue in future.

Interactive Relations among Personality, Relationship Status and Body Image Lindsey Hildebrand \xe2\x80\x9911, Psychology'"
"Disordered attitudes towards eating and body image present serious risks to the physical and psychological health of young women in our society. Thus, an awareness of situational and personality factors that may predict which individuals are at greatest risk is an important goal of clinical psychological research. This study investigated how personality traits relating to orientation towards creating and maintaining relationships with others interact with relationship status to predict young women\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions of their bodies and attitudes towards eating. The data indicated that those in a romantic relationship reported higher body esteem regarding sexual attractiveness and weight concerns but not physical condition. For women in relationships, an inverse correlation was found between level of dependency and esteem for sexual attractiveness that was not present in single women. However, being in a relationship moderated a positive correlation between desire to please others and disordered eating attitudes.

"Research on body image disturbances among ethnic girls indicates that they may be at high risk for disordered eating and depressive symptoms. Sociocultural theories about body image disturbances, including the impact of acculturative stress, have been helpful in understanding body image issues among Latina girls. This study investigated the relationship between body esteem and acculturative stress in predicting eating and depressive symptoms among N=92 Latina and Brazilian girls. Body esteem as well as global self-esteem was examined in the context of acculturation mode (e.g., integration versus assimilation) and bicultural conflict. Correlations supported the predicted bivariate linear relationships and suggest that mode of acculturation may be an important moderating factor.

"Why do some people make more positive health choices than other people? Why do some people prioritize consistent exercise more highly than others? Could certain personality traits affect people\xe2\x80\x99s health behaviors? Questions like these target the intriguing relationship between personality psychology and health. Using data gathered from the Wellesley College community, this study explored the relationship among dispositional optimism, exercise self-efficacy, and health behaviors. Results suggest that different aspects of personality are related to actual exercise behavior vs. beliefs about exercise. Students also hold different beliefs about their own exercise self-efficacy relative to others.

The Influence of Self-construal on Self-presentation Taysir Mahmoud \xe2\x80\x9911, Psychology'"
"Have you ever thought about how to perfectly phrase your Facebook status? Had to behave professionally for an interview? Tried to act a certain way to impress a new friend? These are examples of self-presentation tactics, the set of behaviors used in dayto- day interactions to manage impression formation in interpersonal relations. This study examines the relationship between self-presentation tactics and self-construal. Self-construal (SC) is the set of thoughts and actions that define the relationship between self and society. To varying degrees we all exhibit both independent SC and interdependent SC. Those with more independent SC tend to have a stronger sense of individuality and emphasize unique intrinsic attributes, whereas those with a more interdependent SC tend to be more flexible and emphasize social belonging. Having a better understanding of how these two constructs are related can enhance our understanding of their influence on our daily interpersonal interactions. From Structures to Stress: Biochemistry Seniors Talk about Their Theses (panel discussion) Pendleton Hall West 117 Biochemistry is a diverse field that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological systems. A molecular approach to biology is important in fields like drug development, and can be useful in understanding cellular signaling and processing. In this panel, three seniors majoring in biochemistry will discuss the research they have done for their senior theses, which includes work ranging from cellular responses to stress to an analysis of molecules that affect cell wall structure. The Activity and Mechanism of Action of Three Novel Antimicrobial Peptides Sara Spinella \xe2\x80\x9911, Biological Chemistry'"
"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are polycationic molecules with selective bactericidal and/or anti-cancer activity, and play an important role in the immune system of many species. Our lab has designed three novel AMPs (DesHDAPs 1-3) based on characteristics known to confer potency to buforin II, a \xce\xb1-helical AMP that kills bacteria by translocating across cell membranes and binding to DNA. The goal of this study is to determine the antimicrobial potency, anticancer activity, bacterial selectivity, and translocation ability of DesHDAPs 1-3 and to relate these properties to the peptides\xe2\x80\x99 structural features. Like buforin II, DesHDAP1 shows activity against several bacterial strains, and its ability to cross lipid membranes is dependent on the presence of a key helix-breaking proline residue. In contrast, DesHDAPs 2-3 do not show significant translocation across lipid membranes and display more limited bactericidal activity. This research offers insight into design strategies for novel antibiotics.

Elucidating the Connections between Cytoplasmic Mitotic Cyclins and Cell Wall Integrity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kaylyn Williamson \xe2\x80\x9911, Biological Chemistry'"
"Biological Sciences The four partially redundant Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitotic cyclins, Clb1-4, mediate the transition between the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle by activating their cyclindependent kinase (CDK) binding partner. Clb1-4 concentrate in the nucleus but are also present at lower levels in the cytoplasm. When the cytoplasmic population is eliminated, cell wall integrity is compromised. To understand the molecular basis of this phenotype, our laboratory performed a phosphoproteomic screen that identified putative targets of cytoplasmic mitotic CDK activity. In this study, we aim to validate the results of this large-scale experiment. Specifically, this study focuses on confirming that Bni4, a protein important for cell wall synthesis, is a mitotic CDK phosphorylation target. We also aim to identify Bni4 binding partners in the presence and absence of cytoplasmic mitotic CDK activity to better understand the proposed connections between the cell cycle and cell wall integrity.

When Cells Get Stressed: Characterizing the Interaction between Poly (ADP-ribose) and RNA-binding Proteins in the Stress Granule Stephanie See \xe2\x80\x9911, Biological Chemistry'"
"(Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and Donald Elmore, Chemistry Poly (ADP-ribose) (pADPr) is a post-translational modification implicated in virtually all cellular processes however its specific function in many biological pathways is still unknown. Our lab has recently shown poly ADPribosylation is involved in the stress response pathway, specifically in the nucleation and formation of cytoplasmic bodies called stress granules (SGs). SGs are stalled cytoplasmic translational complexes critical for stress response. SG machinery includes a number of proteins containing RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that are largely responsible for binding mRNA transcripts during SG nucleation during periods of cell stress. Due to the structural similarities between pADPr polymer and single stranded RNA, we believe these RRMs bind may pADPr as well. By characterizing this binding interaction and describing a mechanism, we aim to better understand the role pADPr plays in stress granule formation. This binding interaction may implicate pADPr as RRM targets not only in the SG, but also in a wide variety of other cellular pathways.

Environmental Policy: National and Global Perspectives (panel discussion) Jewett Art Center 450 In order to understand how to make environmental policy, we need to understand how and why various actors react when faced with environmental issues. This panel considers three separate research papers that ask about the determinants of environmental behavior. Why do some states in the US make good use of federal funds for weatherizing homes, while others do not? When are authorities (local or national) likely to be ineffective at keeping lead out of drinking water? Under what conditions are states likely to invest in high-speed rail? These papers all evaluate the role of socioeconomic and political factors in determining environmental outcomes. Weatherizing America\xe2\x80\x99s Homes: Is Federal Aid Going Where It Is Most Needed?

"Studies This study investigates variation in participation in the Federal Weatherization Assistance Program among low-income households across the nation and explores explanations for why this variance occurs. The question of whether those households most in need are receiving the necessary funding becomes especially important when the environmental, health and economic benefits of home weatherization are taken into consideration. The study concludes that the climate, economy, and political leaning of states all contribute to explaining the variance.

First introduced in 1964, high speed trains have only recently expanded to countries throughout the world. Many countries are proposing extensive plans to increase the amount of track within the next 10 years. With all of the hype surrounding high speed trains, are some countries better suited for high speed trains than others? What similarities do countries have that have implemented high speed trains successfully in the past? Do economic, governmental, population and land configuration matter? This study explores which countries have successfully implemented high speed rail, which countries are planning high speed rail, and the commonalities and differences between them.

"Approximately 25 million HIV-positive people live in sub-Saharan Africa. National governments in the region have responded both with prevention efforts and with treatment initiatives, but why have some favored one response over the other? Prevention made dramatic progress in curtailing the epidemic in Uganda, yet this approach was not favored in either Botswana or South Africa. What determines health policy choice in addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic in African states? More specifically, how do governments decide which public health policies to implement in order to tackle the challenges posed by the epidemic? African leaders decide based on an interaction of several factors\xe2\x80\x94economic, political, personal, and sociocultural. In some cases these factors have favored prevention, in other cases treatment, and in still other cases no significant policy response at all. (Research supported by a Jerome A.

"In recent decades, public expectations about the medical profession have contributed to physician complaints about stress, exhaustion, and burnout. In this paper, I first examine the literature of physician-writers who present what they experience and perceive as the limits to medicine and the limitations of their obligations as medical professionals. How are their concerns and frustrations framed by social and historical changes? Some scholars have alluded that the secularization of society may be in part responsible for present frustrations within medicine. What is the relevance of spirituality and religion for understanding these limits and limitations, particularly from a Judeo-Christian perspective? I address these questions by an examination of a variety of writings by physicians, religiously committed writers, and scholars of the history, anthropology, and sociology of medicine. The Impact of Increased Access to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) on Childhood Education and Nutrition in Zambia Margaret Chidothe \xe2\x80\x9911, Economics'"
"More than 1 in every 7 adults in Zambia is living with HIV and life expectancy at birth has fallen to 39 years. The country stood as a pioneer in June 2004 when the government committed to the free provision ARTs for the adult public. Prior to this, ARTs were only available privately. While the provision of life-saving ART treatment has emerged as a central part of the medical and policy response to HIV/AIDS, little is empirically known about the welfare effects of this important intervention on children living with HIV-positive adults. Estimation of the intergenerational effects of ARTs can provide valuable insights into the return on international aid investments, resulting in better informed public resource allocation decisions. My analysis explores how household behavior changes in response to increased access to ARTs if there is an infected adult in the household, measured in terms of children\xe2\x80\x99s education and nutrition.

From Television to Your Medicine Cabinet: The Impact of Directto- Consumer Advertising of Prescription Drugs Emily Scofield \xe2\x80\x9911, Economics and French'"
"Ads for prescription drugs seem to be everywhere, but the consequences of these ads are still unclear. Is direct-to-consumer advertising just informing consumers about treatments that they may not know are available? Or is it creating a culture whereby powerful medicines become ordinary consumption goods? The United States is only one of two countries in the world that allows prescription drug companies to advertise to consumers. This research analyzes the impact of this advertising. Does direct-to-consumer advertising cause people to consume more prescription drugs? How does it affect the amount spent on these drugs? Does advertising differentially impact certain groups of people? I also look at who ultimately pays for any increased consumption\xe2\x80\x94is it the government, the consumers, or insurance companies?

"Over the preschool years children come to understand the relationship between their senses and the knowledge those senses acquire. This development may be supported by sensory experiences or theory-of-mind development. We tested these alternatives by asking hearing and deaf children to identify which of two confederates knew the identity of a toy animal when confederates had differential perceptual access to the animal. In the \xe2\x80\x9cseeing\xe2\x80\x9d condition, only one confederate saw the animal, and in the \xe2\x80\x9chearing\xe2\x80\x9d condition, only one confederate heard it.

Thus, deaf children\xe2\x80\x99s greater experience with vision does not lead to an accelerated understanding of the seeing-knowing connection.

"Anthropology Whereas disease is defined by its symptoms and treatments, my research indicates how the illness experience and its narratives affect these symptoms and treatments. By watching participant-made video diaries, I studied the illness experiences of adolescents living with sickle cell anemia, a blood disorder that most commonly affects blacks and Hispanics in the U.S. The video data I analyzed was collected by Video Intervention/Prevention Assessment, a research project at Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital Boston. Seven adolescents with sickle cell used camcorders to create about 150 hours of video diaries of their everyday challenges, successes, thoughts and activities in the environments in which they live. The illness experiences of adolescents with sickle cell are personally unique, yet can also reflect common experiences. Furthermore, the use of audiovisual narratives (video diaries) can provide rich, qualitative data by allowing participants to be honest and reveal experiences they may have otherwise kept to themselves.

"The Panic of 1907 was a major financial crisis, with striking parallels to the crisis of 2008. As with the recent financial meltdown, the period preceding the 1907 panic saw rapid innovation and change within the financial system. A new type of bank, called a trust company, became an increasingly important financial intermediary. These firms accepted deposits and competed with commercial banks, and yet were not subject to the same regulatory scrutiny. Many of these trust companies became important lenders to industrial companies and railroads, and would place one or more of their directors on the boards of their client firms. The outbreak of the Panic of 1907 occurred following a series of scandalous revelations about the investments of some trusts, resulting in widespread runs on many of these firms. The connections between the trust companies that came under severe strain during the crisis, and their client firms, may have transmitted the financial crisis to nonfinancial companies. Using newly collected data, this thesis investigates whether corporations with close ties to trust companies were differentially affected during the panic. (Research supported by the Jerome A.

"Linguistic Sciences Rap music is a tool of political expression for marginalized or oppressed communities. Its popularity especially thrives in areas embroiled in conflict, such as Israel and the Palestinian Territories. Jewish Israeli and Palestinian/Arab Israeli rappers choose words over weapons, redefining their views and themselves onstage and in the studio. Interestingly, members of both groups insert the language of the Other into their lyrics to add heightened political meaning to their message and expand (or limit) their audience. This device is called linguistic code-switching. In a multimedia presentation, I will show and explain patterns of code-switching in Jewish Israeli and Palestinian/Arab Israeli rap, focusing on artists such as Tamer Nafar and DAM, Arapeyat, Subliminal and the Shadow, Hadag Nachash, and others.

Though Mexican Melodrama never came to fruition, it reflects what seem to be Welles\xe2\x80\x99s lifelong personal and political preoccupations. How does this early script fit into the \xe2\x80\x9cboy-genius\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d career? To what degree does it echo the themes that would ultimately permeate Welles\xe2\x80\x99s body of work? Through close readings of Mexican Melodrama, of Welles\xe2\x80\x99s other uncompleted projects, as well as his produced films and published biographies, I journey into the themes of his films and deepen our understanding of the ever-present anti-fascist sentiment that permeates his body of work. Space, Conflict and Identity: Writing/ Reading Barcelona Jami-Lin Williams \xe2\x80\x9911, Spanish and English'"
"How can a writer express social conflict and discontent under the censorship of a powerful dictator? What is the relationship between the internal changes and conflicts of literary characters and their physical environment? These questions form the foundation of my thesis project, which explores the complex function of space in four novels of the Spanish postwar period set in Barcelona. I examine the \xe2\x80\x9cspatialization\xe2\x80\x9d of the process of identity formation in these texts and the way in which conflict is embedded in the literary configuration of the city. These novels, too, are crucial to the identity formation of the city itself following the devastation of the Spanish Civil War and to establishing its place in the literary imagination of the twentieth century.

"Gascon-Vera, Spanish My thesis focuses on many ways in which foreigners and immigrants are represented in contemporary Spanish film. Economic hardships have propelled many people from around the world to seek better lives in Europe, which has transformed Spain from a country of emigration into a country of immigration. This change has brought out feelings of suspicion and pronounced xenophobia throughout the nation. Through current Spanish films, I have studied this complex relationship within a broader political and economic context. (Research supported by the Office of the Provost and Dean of the College.) Portrait of a Crisis: Zimbabwe 1999\xe2\x80\x932009 (exhibition) Jewett Art Gallery Lucia Nhamo \xe2\x80\x9911, Studio Art'"
"Olsen, Art, and Daniela Rivera, Art The year 1999 marked the beginning of the crisis in Zimbabwe, a ten-year period of socioeconomic decline and political turmoil that was chiefly set into motion by the unlawful seizures of commercially-owned farmland. The decade was characterized by political oppression, state-perpetrated human rights offences and an economic meltdown. This installation is an audio-visual meditation on this period: it juxtaposes state rhetoric with personal stories of experience and survival in Zimbabwe, where the government waged one of the most sustained propaganda campaigns in postcolonial Africa.

"Colonization generates feelings of homesickness and longing for the comforts of familiarity. Once displaced, we attempt to fill this void by transforming our vision of home to a tangible form. Often, we embody this idealization in the architectural style of the homeland vernacular. In Western history, British colonists built Tudor houses in exotic settlements, recreating their romanticized home in strange lands. The Tudor style retreats to the fantastical past; its architectural dialogue speaks of British familial, historical, and cultural roots. This art installation addresses the notion of home embodied in the Tudor architectural style of a portable model. The model can be transported and projected onto foreign landscapes as an expression of our desire to find familiarity within alien environments. Anamorphic perspective, dematerialization, and distortion of the structures themselves through the conventions of transparency, reflections, projections, and shadows silently acknowledge that this is not reality, but an uncanny illusion of home.

"We pass the same people every day\xe2\x80\x94in class, in the bathroom, in the dining hall\xe2\x80\x94yet we don\xe2\x80\x99t always approach them and begin a conversation. Even when we want to make that connection, something stops us: the fear of being nosy or awkward or even too friendly. This art project came from a desire to connect with people, without the barrier of introductions. I interviewed Wellesley students and asked them to join me in painting a quick portrait of themselves, I then borrowed a meaningful object to paint in detail. The flatness and boundaries of a painted surface are limiting, thus I can only retain a small part of that object for myself. Similarly, portraits can never fully capture an individual, and empathy is not as attainable as we would like it to be.

"Goldfish (Carassius auratus) have a unique ability to adapt to low oxygen conditions. In this experiment, we isolated cardiac tissue and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying acclimation to hypoxia. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and gel electrophoresis, we compared gene expression for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1a), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and SUR2 in acclimated and non-acclimated goldfish. We found significant upregulation of HIF1a and NOS, but no significant change in SUR2 expression. Because HIF1a and NOS are regulatory factors involved in the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, significant upregulation suggests increased KATP channel activity. Because SUR2 codes for a structural subunit of KATP channels, no significant change suggests that KATP channel density is not affected.

Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Its Implications for Amusia and Aphasia Patients Sang-Hee Min \xe2\x80\x9911, Neuroscience'"
"Barbara S. Beltz, Neuroscience Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a painless, noninvasive brain stimulation technique that affects perception, cognition, and motor control by modulating regional brain activity. We investigated neuromodulatory effects of tDCS by recording brain potentials in healthy volunteers before and after tDCS while they performed a pitch/ timbre discrimination task. ERP recordings were combined with 20-minute sessions of cathodal/anodal tDCS. We found that cathodal tDCS disrupts the process of auditory attention as applied to pitch and timbre discrimination, suggesting that it affects how we pay attention to sounds. This may have implications for designing neurorehabilitation therapies of amusia/aphasia patients. Peptidases and Reproductive Hormones: The Effects of Estradiol on TOP and PEP in the Brain Jana Qiao \xe2\x80\x9911, Biochemistry'"
"Estradiol is an ovarian steroid hormone essential to reproductive function and requisite to various biological processes. Its release is regulated by an endocrine pathway initiated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is broken down by neuropeptidases thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) and prolyl endopeptidase (PEP). We hypothesized that estradiol levels may correlate with or directly alter TOP and PEP, thereby explaining a role by which it regulates GnRH activity. In this study, fluorimetric activity assays were used to analyze how estradiol alters TOP and PEP enzymatic activity in several mouse brain regions involved in reproductive function. Immunohistochemical assays were also conducted to ascertain localization of TOP, PEP, and estradiol receptor alpha in order to observe how all three components influence each other in their expression and activity.

Effects of the Peptide-degrading Enzyme Thimet Oligopeptidase on Testicular Development and Testosterone Production Tania Dhawan \xe2\x80\x9911, Biological Sciences'"
"Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is a peptidedegrading enzyme that occurs throughout the body, but its highest concentration is in the testes and brain. TOP has been shown to break down an important neuropeptide called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the brain. GnRH regulates steroid hormone production in gonads via the hypothalamicpituitary- gonadal axis. The current study was designed to determine whether TOP also has a local effect on the gonads of male mice. Male mice were injected subcutaneously with a TOP-specific inhibitor (JA-2) and compared to control animals that had not been treated. Animals were sacrificed at six weeks of age and samples of their blood, testes, and brain were collected. There was a trend towards higher circulating testosterone levels in the JA-2 treated mice. Furthermore, testes samples from JA-2 treated animals displayed greater TOP activity compared with the control. These results suggest that TOP acts peripherally to control gonadal function in males.

"Chemistry, and Michael Boyer, Chemistry Radiation chemistry, the study of the interactions of high-energy radiation with matter, has extensive applications and implications in areas such as cancer treatment, waste management, astrochemistry, nuclear chemistry and the material sciences. The interaction of highenergy radiation with matter results in copious quantities of secondary low-energy electrons, which form distinct energetic species that are thought to promote a variety of radiation-induced chemical reactions. The majority of these secondary electrons have energies below 10 eV and react with matter through three mechanisms: (1) dissociative electron attachment (DEA), (2) electron impact excitation, and (3) electron impact ionization. Our goal is to examine the hypothesis that DEA is the primary dissociation mechanism for high-energy radiolysis in the condensed phase. We are studying the dynamics of low-energy electron-induced reactions in multilayer nanoscale thin films of methanol under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Investigation of two new possible radiolysis products, methyl formate (CH3OCOH) and glycolaldehyde (HOCH2CHO) are also underway.

Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Novel Isoprenyl Coumarin Derivatives as Potential Antiviral and Anticancer Agents Tehsina Devji \xe2\x80\x9911, Chemistry'"
"Isoprenyl coumarins have been shown to exhibit potency as both anticancer and anti-inflammatory agents. Most recently, compounds of this class have also shown to be efficacious as antiviral agents against H1N1, which causes Influenza A. While isoprenyl coumarins are ubiquitous in nature, their chemical nuances can be explored in order to conduct structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. To that end, our investigation has involved the design, synthesis and evaluation of a series of novel isoprenylated coumarin derivatives as potential antiviral and anticancer agents. Here we present the synthesis of a novel family of isoprenylated coumarin analogues with modifications targeted towards both the isoprenyl chain structure and the umbelliferone moiety. Based on SAR data, more extensive synthetic modifications to these synthesized analogues are slated for future studies.

"Chloroplast movement and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) via the pigment zeaxanthin are two mechanisms plants employ to optimize photosynthetic performance under changing light intensities. In order to determine the relative importance of both mechanisms in mitigating the degree of photoinhibition we quantified their roles in a wide array of plant species. Cytochalasin B (an actin-depolymerizing agent) and dithiothreitol (a violaxanthin de-epoxidase inhibitor) were used to inhibit chloroplast movement and prevent zeaxanthin synthesis, respectively. We then determined the extent of photoinhibition in the absence of these photoprotective mechanisms under high light stress conditions. Since internal CO2 concentrations are the other important factor in determining photosynthetic behavior, we investigated the relationship between stomatal density and chloroplast movement using confocal microscopy. Leave were fixed with glutaraldehyde to preserve chloroplast positioning and stained with propidium iodide, which allowed the visualization of the stomata.

Biofilms are groups of bacteria that aggregate and form a community where they excrete extrapolysaccharides that serve as a protective barrier between them and their environment. The formation of biofilms varies in differing conditions and the structure of the mature biofilms is indicative of their growth environments. A flow cell system was constructed to test various experimental variables, including flow rate, inoculum concentration and absence or presence of light. This system allows for the supply of media to a growing biofilm under controlled conditions. Internal structures within the biofilms were observed by confocal microscopy.

"Biological Sciences Using a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified a threonine residue within a cyclindependent kinase (CDK) consensus motif in the S. cerevisiae protein Bni4 as a phosphorylation site that exhibited diminished modification when mitotic cyclins were depleted from the cytoplasm in G2/M-synchronized cells. We have previously characterized bud morphogenesis, cytokinesis, and cell wall integrity defects associated with cytoplasmic mitotic cyclin depletion. Bni4 is required for proper assembly of the chitin ring and is also involved in septum formation and the maintenance of bud neck integrity. We assessed the role of CDK1- mediated Bni4 phosphorylation in these processes by mutagenizing the target residue within the identified CDK target motif and testing the ability of the mutant protein to rescue the previously documented synthetic lethality of bni4\xce\x94bni1\xce\x94 double knockout cells.

Understanding Relationships across Time (poster session) Science Center Focus Emotional Processing Deficits and Eating Attitudes in College Women Sarah Siegel \xe2\x80\x9911, Psychology'"
"Previous psychology research has shown that individuals with eating disorders are less able to express the emotions they feel, or identify the emotions of others. These emotional processing deficits are similar to a cognitive-affective deficit called alexithymia. Numerous studies have shown the correlation between emotional processing deficits and clinical eating disorders, yet there is a lack of research on subclinical eating disordered populations in relation to these deficits. The goal of this research was to study clinical and subclinical participants with high endorsement of negative eating attitudes. We hypothesized that individuals with high endorsement would be more likely to display cognitive-affective deficits similar to those of alexithymia, and perform poorly on a perceptual emotional recognition task. Results showed that emotional processing deficits did not predict negative eating attitudes in the subclinical group, but that cognitive-affective emotional processing deficits did predict higher negative eating attitudes in the clinical group.

"Relationships between preschool children and their imaginary companions are complex because of the different types of companions and the many different ways that children relate to them. Based on diary entries made by parents of over 40 children, the child-imaginary companion relationship can be examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. These diaries offer an opportunity to explore the type of play that the children engage in with their imaginary companions, and show how the children interact with them. The relationships can be categorized as being either hierarchical or egalitarian. The type of relationship may be correlated with the type of imaginary companion that the child prefers, or perhaps with the child\xe2\x80\x99s age or gender. How children engage with their imaginary companions day-to-day and the level of autonomy that their imaginary companions derive from the children are also interesting themes that will be explored in the diaries and described.

"How much do children learn in school? What is the value of a rural education? Economists have dedicated significant resources to investigating these questions. We look to an experimental middle school program in Honduras designed for rural communities for answers. We consider a panel data set on a cohort of students from 54 primary schools intended to feed students into these experimental middle schools. Fourteen of these middle schools did not open due to an enrollment cutoff, providing us with exogenous variation in attendance. We administered an achievement test and survey to the students regardless of their attendance behavior, allowing us to consider the effects of this random variation in enrollment on student achievement and labor supply. Attempts to quantify the value added of these experimental, community-based, rural middle schools are underway. (Research Supported by the Office of the Provost and Dean of the College.) The Effect of School Sanitation Facilities on School Attendance Rates in India Catherine Wu \xe2\x80\x9911, Economics'"
"While human capital serves as an important driver of economic growth, poor school attendance rates present a large obstacle to human capital accumulation in developing countries. The high opportunity cost of going to school and the direct costs of education, whether in terms of textbook and uniform costs or reputation costs for girls because of social and cultural norms, are all potential explanations for poor school attendance rates. However, there is also evidence that poor infrastructure and the lack of sanitation facilities in schools contribute to student absenteeism. This paper exploits the variation in the number of toilets in schools provided by a school infrastructure program in India to examine the impact that sanitation facilities have on student attendance.

Whether Japan is portrayed as the victimizer or victim, each memorial positions Japanese men as the protagonists of war, while their women are marginalized in feminine roles, forgotten in history, or disembodied and devoiced. In this comparative study of Japanese WWII memorials, we will explore the ways in which women are exploited as emotional facilitators in the construction of war memorials in Japan. Is the Personal Still Political?: Lesbian Separatism Today Sarah Parmelee \xe2\x80\x9911, Women\xe2\x80\x99s and Gender Studies'"
"Gender Studies Lesbian separatism emerged as a political ideology during the early 1970s. Most lesbian separatist groups branched off from the women\xe2\x80\x99s liberation movement and created their own political stances to suit their needs that were not being met by women\xe2\x80\x99s liberation groups. Their stance during the 1970s was that by withdrawing their energy and support for men, they would be able to focus on creating a women\xe2\x80\x99s culture and simultaneously dissolve the patriarchy. Current lesbian separatist communities are often thought to be the vestige of a radical past, and they remain rarely heard from or studied. My ethnographic fieldwork within one of the largest remaining lesbian separatist communities revealed the political differences between early and current lesbian separatism. Some of the main political focuses include the importance of women-only spaces, aging, and sustainability.

Humanities Ars Bene Dicendi: Rhetoric in Medieval Music (long performance) Pendleton Hall West 220 Natasha Roule \xe2\x80\x9911, Medieval and Renaissance Studies and Music'"
"Rhetoric, the art of eloquent persuasion, fascinated medieval Europeans. In the context of both performance and literature, they imbued music with rhetorical meaning, refuting modern scholarship that generally asserts that such meaning did not appear in Western music until the Renaissance. An understanding of the rhetorical potential of a piece offers insight into the music\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and the cultural background of the musician and audience. This presentation will feature a discussion on rhetoric in medieval musical pieces and literature. The sweetness of birdsong in Old French romances, the tragic love of Tristan and Isled, the mystical chant of Hildegard of Bingen, and the meticulous scholarship of thirteenth century Parisian scholars will shed light on the power of music to move human emotion. My performance on the vielle, harp, and hurdy-gurdy will be joined by bass voice to explore rhetorical music by Hildegard and several troubadours.

"MapQuest stops working in Fairy Land. In Spenser\xe2\x80\x99s epic poem The Faerie Queene (1590/96), the imaginary country of Fairy Land contains moveable kingdoms and an elastic time-space continuum. Many critics believe that Fairy Land is a pure allegorical construct, not to be understood as a physical place, or the haphazard result of poor poetic planning. But what if Spenser had another influence? This project seeks to link Spenser\xe2\x80\x99s work with that of the German cosmographer Sebastian Mu\xcc\x88nster. More than mapmaking, cosmography sought to create a unified description of the entire world with little regard for accuracy. Munster intertwined historical commentary, detailed cityscapes, animal behavior and agricultural legend to depict geographical and cultural character. In the same way, The Faerie Queene serves as a cosmographical guide to the characterized place of Fairy Land. The presentation will also include images from sixteenth century maps and a brief history of sixteenth century cosmography.

"Although Henry VIII attempted to expel them in 1530, gypsies and travelers have been living in England for hundreds of years. Mirroring their official absence but constant presence, gypsies have been both marginal and fascinating figures in English literature, particularly in the eighteenth century novel. This thesis project focuses on gypsies in the works of Daniel Defoe, Henry Fielding, and Jane Austen. Through their portrayals of the gypsies they demonstrate the aesthetic development of the novel occurring during this century, in their approach to characterization, discourse, and genre. Yet, the broader implications of nomadism and itinerancy represented by the gypsies also illuminate eighteenth century social and political preoccupations, including identity, the family, government, nationalism, and empire.

"Three novels in Dickens\xe2\x80\x99s career\xe2\x80\x94 Oliver Twist, David Copperfield and Great Expectations\xe2\x80\x94are distinct for their portrayal of boy \xe2\x80\x98heroes\xe2\x80\x99 who are orphaned and neglected, but also taken under the wing of lawyers and literati. These men make up a new class in English society: the professional. Through the boys\xe2\x80\x99 eyes, we are shown the private offices, libraries, and studies of these professionals who manage and manipulate society. However, what we find is that these spaces reveal much about a whole new culture\xe2\x80\x94one underpinned by its own secret anxieties. What does the Victorian novel\xe2\x80\x99s representation of professional spaces tell us about the professional? Professionalism?

"The North American continent is a mosaic of ancient continents accreted by tectonic collisions over the last four billion years. This project examines evidence for a three-billion-year- old tectonic collision preserved in granite plutons exposed in Yellowstone National Park. The project began last summer in Yellowstone with field observations and collection of rock samples for further study. It continued in the laboratory with microscopic examination of the spatial relationship between minerals in the rock and measurement of the U-Pb crystallization ages of the mineral zircon. The mineralogical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that these granite plutons formed by partial melting of metamorphosed sedimentary continental crust during and/or following collision, rather than by partial melting associated with subduction prior to collision. U-Pb dating of zircon crystals is underway to test this hypothesis. (Research supported by a National Science Foundation REU grant awarded to David Mogk, Montana State University.) Transgenerational Plasticity in Persicaria lapathifolia: Lamarckian Ideas within Darwinian Evolution? Elizabeth Rowen \xe2\x80\x9911, Biological Sciences'"
"Lamarck theorized that characteristics of species changed due to environmental conditions and that these changed characteristics were passed to offspring. Lamarck\xe2\x80\x99s theory of immediate environmental consequences to traits (\xe2\x80\x9cacquired characteristics\xe2\x80\x9d) may still offer some insight to transgenerational plant responses to the environment, within the context of Darwinian evolution. For many plants, it can be beneficial to be able to react to the environment as needed. However, some plants are better prepared for life due to the environmental conditions of their mother, and can gain an advantage over seeds that were not prepared for a certain environment. In order to better understand such transgenerational plasticity, and to determine whether or not it is adaptive, we are conducting a two-generational experiment on Persicaria lapathifolia, exploring how plant competition affects fitness across generations.

"Previous research has demonstrated that young children acquiring English are better able to reason about spatial relationships when they are given language that describes the spatial relation. We investigated the relationship between the acquisition of spatial language and the development of spatial relational reasoning in deaf children. American Sign Language (ASL) is distinct from English because of its visual-spatial nature. While English speakers use lexical prepositions such as \xe2\x80\x9cin,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunder,\xe2\x80\x9d ASL signers use iconic depictions of spatial relations more than lexical prepositions to represent the real-world objects in relation to one another. Thus young ASL signers might use spatial language differently to facilitate their understanding of spatial relationships. Ten deaf children in an ASL-English preschool program completed two spatial mapping tasks that involved an understanding of similarity between two identical setups, a spatial language production task and a spatial language comprehension task. Children\xe2\x80\x99s scores on the cognitive tasks were significantly correlated with the complexity of their spatial language production and with their comprehension of spatial language in ASL.

"Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL) is a rapidly developing language that has recently incorporated grammatical markers produced on the face. When asking questions the youngest signers furrow their brows and lift their chins more than older signers, suggesting that younger signers are introducing these elements into NSL. The current empirical study examines whether these grammatical facial expressions are borrowed from the facial gestures produced by hearing Nicaraguans when asking questions. Twelve adult Nicaraguans with normal hearing and no experience with NSL were videotaped asking a friend a series of questions. We coded for three facial gestures: brow furrow, chin lift, and nose wrinkle. We observed the use of all three facial expressions, and documented the use of two more: side head tilt and brow raise. The similarity between the subset of facial expressions produced by both groups, confirms that grammatical markers in NSL are being adapted from some, but not all, of the gestures used by hearing Nicaraguans.

"More than half of children have an imaginary companion at some point before the age of seven. Although hearing-impaired children may be delayed and do not engage in as much pretend play as their typically-hearing peers, little information exists about whether they understand pretense or create imaginary companions. A survey of hearing-impaired adults provided some information about imaginary companions and fantasy in hearing-impaired children. A set of tasks related to pretend play was administered to children ages two to seven with and without hearing impairments to measure whether children can engage in pretense, follow pretense stipulations, understand the concept of an invisible friend, and then interact with that friend. Hearing-impaired children presented more variation in their interactions than their typically developing peers.

We compared waggle dancing by foragers and the amount of pheromones that workers release as they dance to the genetic composition of colonies (i.e., whether colonies were genetically diverse or genetically uniform because of the insemination status of queens). Our findings will allow us to determine whether the multiple-mating behavior of honey bee queens improves a colony\xe2\x80\x99s foraging effort because individual workers in a genetically diverse colony produce more signals on a per worker basis than workers in a genetically uniform colony.

"Bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, which inhabit the littoral and pelagic regions of Lake Waban, show differences in diet selection and feeding morphology dependent on environment. Our studies have found that littoral fish have wider mouths and a wider pharyngeal jaw apparatus compared to pelagic fish. This enables them to feed on larger and more complex prey items including snails (Gastropoda) and flies (Odonata, Diptera). Pelagic fish feed almost exclusively on Daphnia. These results suggest that bluegill ecomorphs are better adapted to feed within their respective habitats. (Research supported by NSF and Wellesley College Sophomore Early Research Grant.)

"The cues leading to an insect\xe2\x80\x99s molt, shedding of skin, remain poorly understood. In Manduca sexta, it is known that the steroid hormone ecdysone initiates molting. However, the mechanism underlying its release is not known. To determine the role of nutrition in initiating endocrine changes, fourth instar Manduca larvae were fed diets either containing or missing certain macromolecules. Tryptophan, as well as all the other essential amino acids, was found to be necessary for molting. Starved animals were found to overcome inhibitions to molt through ecdysone injections. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of TOR signaling, an amino acid sensor, was found to delay a molt without reducing the growth rate. Investigations of the mechanism by which TOR signaling, amino acids, and ecdysone interact are currently underway.

Understanding Estrogen Effects of an Androgen Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Pui Man Rosalind Lai \xe2\x80\x9911, Neuroscience'"
"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among American men after skin cancer. The development of prostate cancer is highly dependent on hormones. Androgens increase cell growth in prostate cancer. However, androgens can be broken down into metabolites, one of which is 3b-Adiol. This androgen metabolite binds to estrogen receptors and prevents the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture. Interestingly, estrogens, such as estradiol, also bind to estrogen receptors, but do not elicit the same effect as 3b-Adiol. This study seeks to understand why 3b-Adiol, but not estradiol, has an anti-proliferative effect on prostate cancer cells through using a protein interaction assay to identify different proteins interacting with estrogen receptors when bound to either hormone. Studying proteins involved in this pathway will allow us to identify crucial players in the inhibition of cell proliferation in prostate cancer, and provide insight into the possibility of using 3b-Adiol as a candidate drug for prostate cancer treatment. MOER to the ER Story: An Alternative Mechanism for Estrogen Signaling in the Brain Christina Sun \xe2\x80\x9911, Neuroscience'"
"The ovarian steroid hormones, estradiol (E) and progesterone, act in specific brain regions to regulate reproductive behavior and physiology. One function of E is the induction of progestin receptor (PR) expression in the brain, which is predominantly mediated by Estrogen Receptor-\xce\xb1 (ER\xce\xb1). E has more recently been found to also act via membrane ER and trigger rapid cellular events. The potential contribution of this novel mechanism of ER action to the expression of PR in the brain has not been investigated. To understand the role of membrane ER in estrogen signaling in vivo, a transgenic mouse expressing membrane only estrogen receptor-\xce\xb1 (MOER) was developed by Ellis Levin (Pedram et al, 2008). MOER mice express only the ligand binding domain of ER\xce\xb1 at the plasma membrane.

Because all cells in the niche are migrating to their final destination in the brain, it remains a question how the niche is replenished with new precursor cells. Our current hypothesis suggests that hematopoietic stem cells are migrating from the bloodstream to the niche via a vascular cavity. We seek to characterize this cell migration from blood to brain noninvasively using superparamagnetic iron oxide particles and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Using Magnetic Resonance Techniques to Examine a Mouse Model of Schizophrenia Weiya Mu \xe2\x80\x9911, Chemistry'"
"Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that results in severe cognitive impairment and changes in neuroanatomy in humans. The GCPII+/- mouse model attempts to imitate schizophrenia symptoms by decreasing the levels of glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) in the brain. Decreased GCPII should then lead to decreased glutamate activity, which is thought to be a cause for human schizophrenia. Because magnetic resonance techniques are noninvasive, longitudinal studies are done to study mouse brain development over time. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to examine the volumes of whole brain and specific brain regions including the hippocampus and lateral ventricles, regions affected by schizophrenia in humans. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows quantification of brain metabolites. By comparing mutant and normal control mice, we can assess whether or not the mouse model successfully emulates the changes in the brain that occur with schizophrenia.

"Gender stereotypes continue to affect judgments about men and women, especially true in male-dominated fields where relatively few women reach high-ranking positions. Why are women so underrepresented in scientific fields? One possibility is that people assume that women lack the traits needed to be successful scientists. To test this, we investigated whether people associate success in the sciences with masculine traits more than feminine traits. We also assessed whether the association of masculine traits with scientific success was greater in some scientific fields than others. Because past research on stereotyping has shown that people tend to see occupations as requiring masculine traits to a greater extent when those occupations have a relatively high proportion of men, we predicted that stereotypes linking success in science to masculine traits would be most pronounced in sciences where there are relatively few women.

"Twitter is a real-time social networking site where users can share information and personal thoughts about current events. Previous research has suggested that Twitter has been used to mobilize various political groups, and we wanted to study whether the volume and content of tweets can be used to predict an election. My project focuses on the use of sentiment analysis to determine the overall polarity of tweets from the 2010 Massachusetts special Senate election. By comparing positive and negative tweets for each candidate, we can determine the amount of support a candidate receives on Twitter and compare this with traditional predictive polling methods such as Gallup and Pollster. I am also using other machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and clustering in order to improve the accuracy of my results.

"Though childhood bullying has long been prevalent in society, bullying in the twenty-first century has a distinct characteristic: institutionalization. Children are now, more than ever, under the constant surveillance of adults in many kinds of institutionalized settings\xe2\x80\x94particularly in educational institutions. In these circumstances, it would seem as though bullying would cease to exist. However, childhood bullying persists, and public attention to bullying has increased dramatically in recent years. Despite ample popular attention, many sociological questions about bullying go unanswered. Is bullying truly a prevalent problem in schools? What kind of school environment allows for this phenomenon? If institutionalized bullying is not a prevailing problem, then what are possible explanations for widespread popular concerns? By examining these questions in a sociological manner, it becomes easier to answer such questions to ultimately understand the nature and social structure of childhood bullying. Flute Sonatas of J.S.

"In this long performance, we will take a journey through musical compositions of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685\xe2\x80\x931750). J.S. Bach is today considered the most important composer of the Baroque era. His flute sonatas are renowned as outstanding and important works in the repertoire for the instrument. Three of the four sonatas that have been definitively traced to Bach\xe2\x80\x99s authorship will be performed: the Sonata in A Major for flute and obbligato harpsichord, Sonata in E Minor for flute and continuo, and Sonata in E Major for flute and continuo. An investigation of Bach\xe2\x80\x99s cultural and historical inspirations will be presented to provide a platform for understanding each of these pieces and their composer. The Soul, the Song, and the Screen: Constructing the Black Experience (short talks) Pendleton Hall East 239 The Ethnographer\xe2\x80\x99s Trick: Zora Neale Hurston and the Female Trickster in African American Folklore Kris Arden \xe2\x80\x9911, Anthropology'"
"Anthropologists have long collected and studied folklore as an authentic representation of a group\xe2\x80\x99s voice, not only in terms of how that group saw the world, but also how it perceived itself. Zora Neale Hurston based her ethnography Mules and Men around seventy pieces of folklore she collected from African Americans in the South, but problematized the role of the ethnographer by studying a group she was both part of and apart from. Born and raised in the South, she was educated at Barnard College in New York City, and this predominantly white world of academia informed her later interactions with African Americans in the South. In many ways, Hurston functioned as a trickster, an archetype prevalent in folktales that subverted and passed through boundaries at will. The archetype is predominantly a male one, and this research attempts to locate female tricksters in African American folklore. Erykah Badu and D\xe2\x80\x99Angelo: The Philosophy and Aesthetic of a Subversive Neo-soul Sensibility in the Hip-Hop Nation Ali Rucker \xe2\x80\x9911, Music'"
"The trajectory of African American music within American popular music has historically reflected the complex cultural relationships that characterize our nation. This dynamic has long been evident in hip-hop. By the 1990s, white America\xe2\x80\x99s fascination with hip-hop had fostered serious corporate interest in developing the music commercially, which entailed simplifying hip-hop\xe2\x80\x99s musical and poetic content. Mainstream hip-hop continued to foster individual expression, but the genre lost much of its promise as a socially empowering, creatively liberating force. I analyze two albums from 2000, Mama\xe2\x80\x99s Gun by Erykah Badu and Voodoo by D\xe2\x80\x99Angelo, framing them as subversive responses to the state of hip-hop at the turn of the century. In considering the aesthetics and philosophy of \xe2\x80\x9cneo-soul,\xe2\x80\x9d a genre Badu and D\xe2\x80\x99Angelo helped to develop, I address how these artists used innovative forms and sounds to convey their complicated messages, while also winning industry accolades. Writing the Self: Identity Construction in Twentieth Century African American Literature Galen Danskin \xe2\x80\x9911, English'"
"In the nineteenth century, most writing produced by the African American community centered on defending the author\xe2\x80\x99s humanity and calling for others to recognize and respect this humanity. With the pivotal publication of Native Son by Richard Wright, focus was abruptly shifted from defending the identity of the African American community to establishing the place, evolution, and stakes of this identity. How can a writer work to reclaim or redefine an identity that has historically been controlled by another group? Is it possible to do this without reinscribing tropes of oppression, domination, or silence? Examining both Richard Wright and James Baldwin, this presentation will explore the ways in which these authors\xe2\x80\x99 reach beyond limitations imposed by white society and attempt to construct a freer and more independent voice for the African American community. Discrepancies between Black Literature and Their Film Adaptations Boafoa Offei-Darko \xe2\x80\x9911, English'"
"Themes and motifs often change when converting a work of literature into a film. In works by and about black people much is often sacrificed when converting literature into film such as personal narrative, stylistic themes and motifs, and intended audience. When converting black novels into films much more emphasis is placed upon broad and general themes such as sexism and racism taking away from the personal and individual narratives that are presented in the novels. Controversial and complex tropes are often taken out in order to keep the film \xe2\x80\x9caudience friendly.\xe2\x80\x9d This is proven in my analysis of Alice Walker\xe2\x80\x99s The Color Purple and Walter Mosley\xe2\x80\x99s Devil in a Blue Dress. In contrast when a film is converted into a novel, it leaves more room for expansion of characters, narratives and themes such as in the case of Perry Henzell\xe2\x80\x99s The Harder They Come.

"Justice Studies When we assume gendered peace lenses, we begin to see the ways in which different policies and practices are gendered. In this panel discussion, we will assume gendered peace lenses to: discuss abortion access in the United States; common themes present in Western media representations of rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and consider the implications of the 1996 Welfare Reform on pregnant documented immigrant women and their fetuses. Perception and Representation: A Womanist Analysis of Western News Media Representations of Wartime Rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo Jos.phine Kabambi \xe2\x80\x9911, Peace and Justice Studies, Biological Chemistry'"
"Justice Studies The occurrence of rape during the Congo wars and its continuance following the signing of peace accords have captured Western media attention as activists and politicians have worked to end the impunity of, and break the silence behind, wartime rape. The news media has played an important role in (re)producing several themes concerning not only rape \xe2\x80\x9cvictims,\xe2\x80\x9d but also the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as a country. Media reinforces many stereotypes and creates dichotomies of \xe2\x80\x9cus/them\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cour/their actions and characteristics.\xe2\x80\x9d It is therefore important to analyze and understand the ways in which the media we consume contains certain racist, sexist, and imperialistic assumptions. In this talk, I will reveal some of prominent themes present in BBC News reporting on wartime rape in the DRC. Understanding the Impact of 1996 Welfare Reform on Immigrant Access to Prenatal Care Yasmin Kassam \xe2\x80\x9911, Neuroscience and Peace and Justice Studies'"
"Justice Studies On August 22, 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA, or \xe2\x80\x9cwelfare reform\xe2\x80\x9d). PRWORA instituted a five-year ban on documented immigrants accessing some federal benefits like Medicaid. For documented, pregnant immigrant women who are unable to pay for prenatal care out of pocket, this five-year ban essentially blocked access to prenatal care. I look at the implications of this ban from various rights discourses (human rights, citizen rights, fetal rights) and social justice perspectives (from Liberation Theology to feminist theorists) to better understand the \xe2\x80\x9cjustice\xe2\x80\x9d implications of this policy for documented and pregnant immigrant women. Undue and Unnecessary Burden: An Investigation of Abortion Access and the TRAP Effect Hilary M. Allen \xe2\x80\x9911, Peace and Justice Studies'"
"Since the decision of Roe v. Wade, abortion discourse in the United States has been a heated debate between two polarized views. The ruling of Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1991) and the redefinition of \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d made it possible for states to propose and enact more stringent abortion restrictions. Through a Peace and Justice Studies framework, I am investigating abortion access in Mississippi and West Virginia, not through the direct prohibition of abortion, but through indirect legislation that has severely limited access to abortion and other family planning services.

"Previous research has found that college students with more severe post-reading binocular visual abnormalities reported more symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Wilmer and Buchanan, 2009). We theorized that these visual abnormalities may cause ADHD symptoms by inducing visual stress during nearwork. In this study, we measured visual abnormalities with a battery of binocular vision tests both before and after a challenging reading comprehension test. We also assessed self-reported visual stress and a broad range of personality characteristics associated with ADHD. Individuals who reported more visual symptoms on the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) reported significantly higher ADHD symptoms on both the ADHD Index of the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales and the Nadeau College-level ADHD Questionnaire. We conclude that visual symptoms are highly, and specifically, predictive of ADHD symptoms. This relationship is consistent with our theory that binocular visual abnormality causes ADHD symptoms by inducing visual stress. (Research supported by the Brachman Hoffman Fellowship Award.) Video-game Training Improves Precision of Smooth Pursuit Eye Movements Lily Tsoi \xe2\x80\x9911, Neuroscience'"
"Large individual differences in the precision of smooth pursuit eye movements (the ability to smoothly track a moving object) raise the question of where these differences come from and whether they can be modified through experience. We examined the effects of video-game training on smooth pursuit precision by training 41 participants in one of three types of video games (sports, action, and strategy) for one hour a day for seven days. Results indicate that training in certain video games can improve smooth pursuit precision, which may be beneficial for people ranging from those with visual deficits to professional athletes.

Keep Your Eye on the Ball: Watching and Playing Sports Linked to Smooth Pursuit Precision Sarah Koopman \xe2\x80\x9911, Neuroscience'"
"Although smooth pursuit eye movements, used to follow a moving object, were presumably beneficial to those species that evolved them, we know little of their importance in modern society. Given that some people smoothly pursue moving objects more precisely than others, if precise smooth pursuit is important for a task, individuals with more precise pursuit should perform that task better. In order to investigate the potential importance of smooth pursuit, I studied smooth pursuit eye movements in relation to playing sports, in particular Ultimate Frisbee. I found that participants who played sports or watched sports on television had more precise smooth pursuit than those who did not. To measure smooth pursuit precision, participants pursued dot targets of various speeds while an eye tracker recorded their eye movements. Participants also answered questions about their experiences in sports and other activities involving vision.

Cardinal Color Axes in Macaque Monkeys Cleo Stoughton \xe2\x80\x9911, Neuroscience'"
"The mechanisms by which the outputs of the L, M, and S cones are processed by the brain to produce color perception are incompletely known. The macaque has been used as a model for human color vision, but it remains unclear whether it has the same color perception as humans. Krauskopf et al. (1982) found that thresholds to colors along certain color axes were selectively elevated following adaptation to stimuli saturating those particular axes, while thresholds to intermediate colors were not elevated to the same degree following adaptation to saturated intermediate colors. Thus they concluded that there are two cardinal chromatic axes: L-M and S. We sought to investigate whether macaque monkeys have the same cardinal chromatic axes as humans. Sixteen hues were presented at various saturations while the subjects\xe2\x80\x99 ability to detect the hue was measured under various adapting conditions. Preliminary results suggest that macaque monkeys have similar chromatic cardinal axes as human subjects.

Creativity in Math: Visualizing Different Forms of Arithmetic (interactive teaching presentation) Pendleton Hall West 116 Amanda Curtis \xe2\x80\x9911, Mathematics, and Jane Rieck \xe2\x80\x9911, Mathematics'"
"In elementary school arithmetic, you are taught that every math problem has only one answer. Two times six is always twelve. The truth is that this familiar arithmetic is just one of many possibilities. There are other equally valid ways to do arithmetic in which two times six might equal, for instance, zero. Moreover, these \xe2\x80\x9cnonstandard arithmetics\xe2\x80\x9d have real applications, and are also important objects of study for mathematicians. Studying such a system often involves symbol manipulation, which, while suitable for rigorous proof, can sometimes cloud our intuition about the overall structure of the system. In our research, we are investigating ways of representing these structures visually in order to complement the symbolic approach. In our presentation, we will introduce these nonstandard arithmetic systems and, with the help of our audience, explore several examples. No prior knowledge of mathematics will be assumed.

"The limits and possibilities of multiculturalism in community life remain deeply contested on college and university campuses. Research on campus diversity from the past two decades have suggested that while institutions are drawing an increasingly heterogeneous pool of students, they are likewise experiencing the cleaving of university spaces into racial-ethnic enclaves. Using 640 surveys from Wellesley seniors and sophomores and in-depth interviews with student organizational leaders, my thesis explores racial bridging and bonding on campus: Does an environment as diverse as Wellesley necessarily translate into healthy cross-cultural exchange, or is diversity counteracted by self-segregation? This study investigates the extent to which pre-college experiences and attitudes surrounding race influence a student\xe2\x80\x99s propensity for multiracial friend groups\xe2\x80\x94a finding that can inform the development of institutional policies aimed at nurturing more intergroup linkages.

Immigration, Identity, and Right Extremism: The Construction of Anti-Immigrant Ideology in the Austrian Freedom Party Megan Henry \xe2\x80\x9911, Sociology'"
"In recent years, issues of immigration have increasingly shaped social and political discourses around the world. Immigrant groups have been met with growing hostility in nations worldwide, and have been repeatedly characterized as a threat to society by individuals and political parties. This trend is particularly evident in Austria, where anti-immigration and anti-immigrant sentiment has increasingly shaped public debates and become an important political issue. The Austrian Freedom Party (FP\xc3\x96), in particular, has both exploited and contributed to political and social tensions over issues of immigration. In doing so, the FP\xc3\x96 has employed extremist, anti-Muslim and xenophobic language, and has drawn upon notions of an imagined and exclusively Austrian cultural identity and history to frame immigration discourse in Austria.

"In 2000, the Nisga\xe2\x80\x99a Final Agreement came into force and created an unprecedented form of aboriginal self-government in Canada. The Nisga\xe2\x80\x99a nation\xe2\x80\x99s experiment with a \xe2\x80\x9cthird order\xe2\x80\x9d government is an example of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s liberal commitment to accommodating the minority group needs of its multicultural citizenry. But questions remain in theory and practice: is aboriginal self-government a form of cultural accommodation compatible with liberal political theory and is it constitutional in Canada? The debate centers on whether sovereign aboriginal nations can be born from aboriginal treaty rights protected in the Canadian Constitution, and highlights the threat of the Nisga\xe2\x80\x99a Constitution upon the Canadian Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s supremacy. This debate grapples with a rights-centric liberal political paradigm, as not all aboriginal peoples subscribe to this political paradigm and have different interpretations of nationhood and citizenship.

"conference, members of the program committee had worried that it might be difficult to recruit students to participate in this ambitious communal experiment. Indeed, that was the question on Barbara Ruhlman\xe2\x80\x99s mind throughout much of the year. Once the day of the conference had arrived, however, a new question had come to occupy their minds: What if no one attends? The conference had been organized into concurrent sessions scheduled from 3 to 7 pm and, because no change to the class schedule was made that day, late-afternoon classes overlapped with the first block of conference presentations. At a place already over-populated with lectures, performances and other community events, who would be interested in attending yet another optional event? Many were. The student, faculty and staff turnout that afternoon was respectable, if not large, and faculty and staff outnumbered students in most sessions. Of greater significance, both those who presented and those who attended the first conference left with the impression that they had participated in something special, urging those in charge of planning the conference to find ways to increase involvement among all constituencies of the college.

Why was the Ruhlman Conference such a success?

Although the Ruhlman Conference provided a venue to applaud and celebrate the hard work necessary to produce excellent projects, its focus was on the results of that hard work\xe2\x80\x94the knowledge, understanding and joy that comes through serious intellectual engagement. More than 15 years later, it is hard to imagine Wellesley without the Ruhlman conference. It is built into our calendar and our consciousness. Students look forward to their presentations as they plan their research projects. Faculty mark the years by remembering which students participated in a Ruhlman panel or poster session. Deans describe the conference to candidates for faculty positions as one of the great selling points of the institution. Other colleges planning student research conferences look enviously at the structure we have built. Part of the joy of the day is the way in which traditional divisions are broken down. Science talks happen in Pendleton, poetry readings in the Science Center. Panels are created that cross disciplines and make new connections; the audiences are filled with staff, faculty, and students interacting with the presenters and with one another in new ways. And part of the joy comes from Barbara Ruhlman\xe2\x80\x99s obvious delight in her creation. The gratitude that flows back and forth between her and the students adds to the special nature of the day and is a manifestation of the connections among generations of Wellesley alumnae. It is not difficult to see why the Ruhlman Conference has become such a valued Wellesley tradition. Lee Cuba is Professor of Sociology and former Dean of the College.

Instead, she turned to producing cloth-stamped book covers and works in stained glass and is credited as the first person to procure full-time employment as a book designer. My paper will use Whitman\xe2\x80\x99s life and work to explore how her social networks of artists, authors, and reformers shaped her work across media and illuminate issues facing women artists in the context of the fine press revival in Boston, the gender politics of craft, and notions of feminine sensibility.

"South Korea has become a powerhouse of Christianity in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, which is a surprising phenomenon considering Protestant Christianity was only introduced to Korea beginning in 1884. Therefore, my research explores reasons why Christianity took hold in Korea while it was firmly rejected in other parts of East Asia. Additionally, it explores the way Koreans have used their folk traditions to make Christianity their own. In so doing, Koreans departed from the strict doctrine they were taught by the pioneer missionaries to Korea and instead practice a ""Koreanized"" form of Christianity. In addition, my research analyzes how today\'s Korean missionaries are changing global Christianity in their attempts to share Christianity with the world. In sharing impressing their spirituality onto others, Korean missionaries not only create converts but they also alter the demographics of Heaven, a change the pioneer missionaries to Korea would never have anticipated.

"While the historical and religious roots of kaji kito (""ritual prayer"") lay in Tibetan tantric and Chinese Buddhist practices, the most direct influence of kaji kito in Nichiren Shu Buddhism, a Japanese Buddhist sect founded by the Buddhist monk, Nichiren (1222\xe2\x80\x931282), comes from Shingon and Tendai Buddhism, two Japanese Buddhist traditions that precede Nichiren\'s time. The ritualistic aspect of the term ""kaji"" suggests divine bestowal, which can also be explained in the context of Shinto, an indigenous practice of worshipping kami (spiritual deities). However, the hidden nature of this practice evokes mysticism, often leading to its incorrect interpretations. The presentation will not only look at the historical development, but also the meaning of kaji kito both during and after Nichiren\'s time, including the physical practice of kaji kito called aragyo, a 100\xe2\x80\x93day ascetic practice undergone annually in Japan by some Nichiren Shu priests.

"An emergent strand of American Evangelicalism called Dominionism seeks to take control over American society in order to catalyze the second coming of Christ. Through the use of divinely appointed prophets and apostles, Dominionism has reimagined the structure of the Church and gained a significant following in both the US and abroad. Prophecy and social action are not novel concepts within American Evangelicalism, as previous moral initiatives 9:30\xe2\x80\x9310:40am Abstracts like Prohibition show. Yet dominionists seem to have recalibrated these Evangelical practices in order to express their radical worldview. The focus has shifted from moral to total spiritual reform.

This project explores the eschatological theology, bellicose rhetoric, and furtive practices of Dominionism and asks if and when Christian spiritual warfare will shift from a theological to a violent socio-political movement.

"Languages and Literatures The Cultural Revolution (1966\xe2\x80\x931976) launched by Mao Zedong pushed China into a decade of national calamity. Families were torn apart, intellectuals were persecuted, children turned on their parents, and many were publicly humiliated at struggle sessions. In the literary movement that followed the years after the Cultural Revolution, known as \xe2\x80\x9cScar Literature,\xe2\x80\x9d writers such as Ba Jin and Yu Hua wrote about the hardships and atrocities that the Chinese people endured. They sought to restore the basic principles of humanity and morality back into Chinese culture and society, and questioned how one man was able to influence thousands to inflict pain, violence, and death on others (including their beloved ones).

Love and Intimacy in Modern Chinese Literature Helen Yinan Ge \xe2\x80\x9912, International Relations- Political Science,'"
"Languages and Literatures Love and intimacy is an exceptional topic that invites varied responses and representations in Chinese literature. The traditional style of romance was in decline when the storming New Culture Movement that spread the ideas of westernized romanticism reformed Chinese literature and individualism as the means of resisting the feudalistic patriarchy that supported the structure of arranged marriage. But over the entire course of the twentieth century, the representation of love and intimacy went through a metamorphosis that showed the mingling of literature and politics, or the merging of the public life and private life. Love and intimacy could be revolutionized, repressed, or sanctioned. Through this paper, I would like to explore the topic through the discussion of four phases in the development of modern Chinese literature: 1) before the revolution, 2) the new culture movement, 3) the era of the Communist revolution, and 4) the post-Mao epoch. I have selected four authors to represent each of the literary eras I have addressed above: Wu Jianren, Ding Ling, Eileen Chang, and Chu Tienwen. Ultimately, I hope to deepen our understanding of how the idea of romantic love in literature has been affected by political and cultural changes in China. The Evolving Status of Feminism in Chinese Literature Natalie Griffin \xe2\x80\x9914, Economics'"
"Languages and Literatures This paper looks into the dynamic relationship between womanhood and Chinese literary modernity. The way Chinese literature represents women has changed significantly during the twentieth century. Wu Jianren\xe2\x80\x99s The Sea of Regret was one of the first Chinese novels to feature a female protagonist. Later, other leading male writers like Lu Xun and Shen Congwen promoted women\xe2\x80\x99s liberation in their writings. However, although women had been trying to achieve equality by writing since before the twentieth century, it was only in the middle of the century that female writers like Ding Ling and Eileen Chang became as respected as male writers. Eventually, Chinese feminism transitioned into appreciating each woman\xe2\x80\x99s individuality, femininity, and sexuality, as shown in the works of contemporary women writers such as Xi Xi and Zhu Tienwen. Through analyzing these works, I will explore the intricate interactions between the transforming literary modernity and the evolving status of feminism in modern China. The Construction of Farcical Realism Michelle Vogelzang \xe2\x80\x9913, Biology and Peace and Justice Studies'"
"Languages and Literatures Lu Xun, who is usually considered the father of modern Chinese literature, captured the Chinese reality through a combination of allegorical discourse and truth-claiming representation. Although Lu Xun\xe2\x80\x99s literary style became dominant in the making of China\xe2\x80\x99s literary modernity, it was adapted by his successors who sought to expand the structure of Chinese realist fiction. For example, in the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s, Lao She, as a follower of Lu Xun, nevertheless broke away from the realism model laid out by Lu Xun to form a new farcical realist literary style. In my presentation, Lao She\xe2\x80\x99s farcical realism and use of melodrama will be thoroughly examined through analyzing his novels The Two Mas, Cat Country, and Camel Xiangzi. Furthermore, brief comparisons will be made between the techniques and themes of Lao She\xe2\x80\x99s farcical realist writings and Lu Xun\xe2\x80\x99s allegorical realism as found in his major works \xe2\x80\x9cDiary of a Madman\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9c The Real Story of Ah-Q\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cA New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Sacrifice\xe2\x80\x9d.

"Yoshinao Nakada (1923 \xe2\x80\x93 2000), considered by many to be ""The Schubert of Japan"", is a prolific Japanese composer who wrote nearly 3,000 vocal, choral and piano pieces in diverse genres. Nakada\'s songs are loved and continue to be sung by many Japanese, both young and old. Nakada, who was a pianist with small hands, also made unique and significant contributions to piano pedagogy. One such major contribution was his work advocating for a small-sized piano for children to prevent them stiffening their wrists and arms and using unnecessary force in their fingers. Through this performance, accompanied by a short talk, we will introduce the wonderful world of Nakada through several art songs as well as through piano pieces from his books Piano Pieces for Little Hands and Children\xe2\x80\x99s Dreams.

"Metamorphosis is a drastic change in form between juvenile and adult life stages that occurs in many organisms. Although this change in form is often thought of as a process that occurs primarily in insects, humans also undergo a less drastic transition during puberty. The hormonal basis of metamorphosis and puberty are very similar in that both are initiated and regulated by neurohormones of the brain. In vertebrates, POU domain transcription factors (TF) have been linked to neuroendocrine changes associated with puberty. In order to better understand the processes of metamorphosis and puberty, we are investigating the function of a homolog of the POU domain TF, ventral veins lacking (vvl), found in the holometabolous insect, Tribolium castaneum. The link between vvl and key insect hormones, including the steroid hormone ecdysone and juvenile hormone, will be discussed. (Research supported by NSF.)

"In order to grow, insects must replace their old skin with a bigger one in a process called molting. Although it is known that the increased secretion of the steroid hormone ecdysone triggers molting, the factors responsible for this hormonal change remain poorly understood. To determine what nutritional cues initiate molting, fourth instar Manduca sexta larvae were fed modified diets. Amino acids were found to be necessary for molting. Additionally, when larvae were fed rapamycin, an inhibitor of an amino acid sensitive pathway, the timing of the molt was affected. Studies on the molecular changes associated with the disruption of this pathway are underway. (Research supported by the National Science Foundation and the Brachman Hoffman Fund.)

"""Why can't humans grow back arms, like insects? What genes are involved in regeneration in beetle appendages, and are their functions conserved through the animal kingdom? Understanding regeneration, a widespread phenomenon among the Metazoa, has profound implications in fields, such as regenerative medicine and evolutionary biology. To investigate the mechanisms underlying leg and antennae regeneration, I have been using RNA intereference to determine the roles of a few candidate transcription factors during larval appendage regeneration in the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. In addition, I have been investigating what gene transcripts are uniquely regulated during regeneration, using a genome-wide assay, RNA-seq. Thus, from this research, I hope to contribute to our current understanding of what genes are involved in insect appendage regeneration. The Role of Temperature and Hox Genes on the Regulation of Abdominal Pigmentation in Oncopeltus fasciatus Aabha Sharma \xe2\x80\x9912, Biological Chemistry"""
"Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a genotype to produce contrasting phenotypes in different environments, is prevalent, but its regulation remains poorly understood. Temperature and gene expression were manipulated to understand how phenotypic plasticity was regulated in the abdominal melanic pigmentation of milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. A higher temperature induced lighter abdominal melanic pigmentation and a lower temperature induced darker pigmentation in abdomens of milkweed bugs. The knock-down of Abdominal-B caused extra melanic pigmentation in a segment that normally lacked pigmentation and the knock-down of abdominal-A resulted in almost pigment-less abdomen. The knock-down of Tyrosine Hydroxylase resulted in complete loss of pigmentation from the body. We hypothesize that Abd-B is a repressor and abd-A a promoter of melanic pigmentation. Moreover, TH must be required for the development of melanic pigmentation in general. Currently, we are analyzing the genetic interactions between these genes and the environment, and the adaptive significance of plasticity.

"Population-centric counterinsurgency theory, advanced by the U.S. military\xe2\x80\x99s 2006 Field Manual 3\xe2\x80\x9324, dictates that U.S. forces must engage local populations to effectively combat insurgencies. Since 2009, the United States has increasingly employed Female Engagement Teams (FETs) in Afghanistan to gain access to the female population. Proponents of the program argue that winning over women is essential for building local confidence and gaining access to information, and in turn suppressing the insurgency. While the FET program is frequently upheld as a proven concept, I argue that this conclusion has been reached simply because the program corresponds with the doctrinal model promoted by FM 3\xe2\x80\x9324. The contribution of the FET program to quelling the insurgency in Afghanistan has not been critically examined, a reflection of the military\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to test its own assumptions about the utility of population-centric COIN in the country.

"Venita Datta, French Few people know that the iconic garconne, or flapper, style of the 1920s emerged during the years 1908\xe2\x80\x931914: in this era, women began shedding their cumbersome skirts and corsets in favor of flexible foundations and a youthful, slim silhouette. Because World War I is usually considered the catalyst for garconne fashions, however, the crucial transitional period of the Belle Epoque is frequently overlooked. During the Belle Epoque, attitudes towards the female body became more positive as pleasure during sexual intimacy became more acceptable and as seductive lingerie came into fashion. Exercise for women also became popular, challenging the ideal of the delicate female body; sportswear did not disguise and constrict the female body to the same degree as everyday fashions. Both of these cultural developments reinforced changing attitudes towards women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies, leading to 1910s fashions that idealized a natural, modern female body shape.

"My research explores the relations among personality, sexual attitudes, and women\xe2\x80\x99s sexual behavior. In particular, I focused on women with ""unrestricted"" sociosexual orientation, who are more inclined to engage in casual sex. To better understand the characteristics of women in this population, 110 Wellesley College seniors reported their attitudes about casual sex, completed personality measures, and reported their past and expected number of sexual partners. The specific issues explored were: 1) which personality traits are correlated with a high/low number of sexual partners, 2) which women with unrestricted sexual attitudes have had and/or realistically expect to have a high number of partners, 3) how goal orientation influences sexual behavior. The correlations found between personality, sexual attitudes, and sexual behavior will be discussed.

"The philosopher PF Strawson revolutionized the philosophical conversation about responsibility by introducing the idea that being a responsible agent involves being a suitable object of \xe2\x80\x9creactive attitudes\xe2\x80\x9d like blame, forgiveness, resentment, and gratitude. He also defended the claim that we respond to evidence of impaired ability by suspending these reactive attitudes and adopting instead the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective attitude,\xe2\x80\x9d which consists of treating the \xe2\x80\x9cabnormal\xe2\x80\x9d person as someone to be managed. After a close look at the classic Strawsonian piece, I seek to demonstrate through real world scenarios involving Asperger\xe2\x80\x99s syndrome and PTSD that (1) we are much more forgiving (both theoretically and actually) than Strawson supposes and are capable of modifying (rather than suspending) reactive attitudes when we encounter impaired abilities, and also that (2) we should accommodate people with these disabilities by rethinking our expectations about the role of reciprocity in shaping reactive attitudes. 9:30\xe2\x80\x9310:40am Captivating Albertine: Desire, Recognition, and the Problem of Intersubjectivity in Proust\xe2\x80\x99s \xc3\x80 La Recherche du Temps Perdu Olivia Brown \xe2\x80\x9912, Philosophy'"

La Recherche du Temps Perdu, the narrator Marcel acutely desires to understand Albertine\xe2\x80\x94an elusive, enigmatic, and almost certainly bisexual jeune fille. Albertine\xe2\x80\x99s identity resists fixity because her expressions (gestures, actions, speech) lend themselves to mutually incompatible interpretations; consequently, Marcel is challenged to assemble a narrative that will render her expressions intelligible while cohering with their true significance. There are two methods by which Marcel can develop knowledge of Albertine\xe2\x80\x99s essential identity: he must (1) compel her to reciprocate his desire, or (2) paradoxically release her from scrutiny to become a stranger. I investigate the outcomes of these methods to determine whether either of them can potentially succeed.

"How self-transformation through a pretend play intervention affects executive functioning performance was examined in 32 preschoolers (Mage = 51.10 months, range 3\xe2\x80\x935 years). Children were divided into two groups, and given a cape to wear. For the self-transformation group, the cape was described as having special, game-playing powers. For the control group, the cape was described as just part of the game. The hypothesis was partially supported; children in the self-transformation group outperformed those in the control group on one inhibitory control task (p = .000, \xce\xb72 = .50), and was non-significant, but in the expected direction, for the other two tasks. Additionally, self-transformation had greater effects on response inhibition than on attention shifting tasks (p = .003, \xce\xb72 = .32).

"Within a large and growing honey bee colony, overpopulation results in the initiation of a reproductive process known as swarming, which divides one colony into two smaller colonies. When a colony swarms, roughly two-thirds of its population departs with the original queen to found a new nest. Workers are aware of the queen\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the airborne swarm via the pheromones that she emits and our previous work shows that a queen\xe2\x80\x99s pheromone production increases prior to liftoff. To determine how queens prepared for liftoff and how worker-produced signals facilitate this process, swarming was induced in colonies and queens were monitored through the process for pheromone production and changes in body temperature and activity level. These queen metrics were related to simultaneous activities of workers in the swarm. Our study provides insight into the mechanisms that prepare queens for liftoff and for keeping airborne swarms cohesive.

As sessile organisms exposed to often drastically fluctuating light intensities, plants have evolved several mechanisms for maintaining the delicate balance between maximizing photosynthetic yield and minimizing photooxidative damage. The xanthophyll cycle allows plants to quickly transition from a state of high photochemical efficiency to one of cautious photoprotection upon changes in light conditions. The associated photoprotective state, known as nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), prevents photodamage by innocuously dissipating excess absorbed light energy as heat. We compared the capacity of a range of species to perform NPQ and quantified its photoprotective importance by comparing the abilities of leaves treated with dithiothreitol, a xanthophyll cycle inhibitor, and untreated leaves to recover from high light stress. Ultimately, we hope to better understand photoprotection in plants by comparing our results to data describing the importance of chloroplast movement, another prominent photoprotective strategy. Tip Growth: Assessing the Functional Equivalence of COW1 in A. thaliana and P. patens Jessica Lee \xe2\x80\x9912, Biological Sciences'"
"Tip growth, or polarized cell expansion, produces cellular morphologies characterized by an outgrowth extending from a main body. Tip growth processes involve membrane trafficking to a specific growing point during cellular morphogenesis, and the resulting structure frequently allows for specialized cellular function. The model bryophyte Physcomitrella patens is an optimal system for tip growth studies. A previously characterized COW1 mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana individuals manifests a phenotype consistent with a tip growth defect (Grierson et al. 1997). Three putative COW1 homologs were identified in the P. patens genome based on sequence similarity, and a cross-species complementation study is underway to assess the functional similarities of these homologs to COW1. Identification of a functionally equivalent COW1 homolog in P. patens would suggest that its tip growth-specific function arose early in the evolution of land plants, and provide a conveniently simple model for investigating tip growth processes in the laboratory. Catching Nemo: Fish Escape Strategies and Performance Allison Robbins \xe2\x80\x9913, Biological Science, and Janet Jeong \xe2\x80\x9914, Psychology'"
"Successful predator evasion is essential for the survival of many animals. Performance, and therefore escape success and evolutionary fitness, is strongly influenced by both morphological and behavioral factors. Bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) found in Lake Waban exhibit morphological differences based upon habitat. Shallow water fish have deeper body shapes, a morphology associated with increased escape performance. We therefore hypothesized that these fish would exhibit greater fast start performance than the more streamlined deep water form. Behavioral strategies also influence escape success. For example, random, unpredictable escape directions may confuse predators, but limit specialization to maximize performance. Escape performance was analyzed from high-speed video recordings. Contrary to our predictions, deep water fish had significantly higher peak velocities and accelerations. Escape directions were also non-random. Each fish showed two or more preferred directions, but with enough variation to preserve unpredictability. Determining the Importance of Two Photoprotective Mechanisms in Arabidopsis thaliana When Exposed to High Light Stress Treatments Katrina Soriano \xe2\x80\x9912, Biological Sciences'"
"In order to study the relative importance of chloroplast movement and the xanthophyll cycle as photoprotective mechanisms utilized by Arabidopsis thaliana we determined the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II before and after 90 min of high light exposure. We performed these treatments on WT and mutants that show partially reduced photoprotective abilities (npq1, phot2, phot1/phot2). In addition, we used inhibitors to selectively disable one or the other photoprotective mechanisms. As an actin-depolymerizer, cytochalasin B inhibits chloroplast movement and resulted in reduced high light stress tolerance. A. thaliana WT exhibited the greatest difference in recovery when comparing the control and cytB treated leaves, while A. thaliana phot1phot2 leaves showed the smallest difference. We will discuss the relative importance of these two mechanisms. Drinking from the Fire Hose: Dealing with Large Datasets (short talks) Pendleton Hall West 212 Video Summarization: How to Understand Hours of Video in Seconds Caroline Gallagher \xe2\x80\x9914, Computer Science'"
"Computer Science, and Sohie Lee, Computer Science A large amount of video is being collected for environmental monitoring, biological analysis, and even ""virtual visits"" around the world using the global network of publicly-available webcams. It is impossible to watch all of this footage; however, with summarization techniques, it may be possible to quickly understand important trends and events. I will discuss my work in computer vision that identifies objects and condenses video streams into shorter, still understandable videos. I will also discuss issues that arise while processing real-world video and how anomaly detection methods can be used to highlight the most interesting objects and events.

Launching Environmental Modeling into the 21st Century: GUI Based Multi-Variable Environmental Risk-Assessment Shilpa Idnani \xe2\x80\x9912, Environmental Studies, and Madeleine Adams \xe2\x80\x9913, Undeclared'"
"Most modeling software systems for environmental analysis are unwieldy and difficult to use for the average consumer. They require individual training and have limited visualization capabilities. In this project, we are creating a visually appealing user-generated small-scale property model on which we apply environmental and climate change factors to estimate property damage and property weaknesses. Users will help generate a three dimensional diagram of an individual property or area and detail property characteristics such GPS coordinates, land features, water levels and flora types. The program will generate precipitation, weather, and other geographic information for the period of time specified by the user. After assessing weaknesses, users will be able to manipulate their property to minimize damage and possible risk. Investigating the Structural Determinants of Electrostatic Binding among Proteinprotein Complexes: A Systematic, Largescale Computational Study Emma Nechamkin \xe2\x80\x9912, Chemistry'"
"We seek to understand electrostatic determinants of protein binding. Electrostatics are both commonly manipulated in design and relevant to protein recognition. This project aims to map out electrostatic contributions to protein-protein binding as they relate to structural components of proteins. By systematically using a continuum electrostatics model on a large set of protein complexes, we quantify the electrostatic contributions of protein structural elements including distal and local regions of proteins and backbone and side chain residue contributions. This study will also address whether protein specificity and promiscuity correlate to electrostatic component contribution and whether trends exist among proteins when correlated to monopole, fold, or size. By using many protein structures, statistically significant trends may be elucidated. Social Media: Free Speech and Anonymity for Exposing the Narco Conflict in Mexico Yesenia Trujillo \xe2\x80\x9914, Computer Science'"
"Science Since 2006, the Mexican government has started to crack down on organized drug traffic. Military, police and the drug cartels are openly in war, which have cost more than 40,000 lives. They are all interested in keeping the violence off of newspapers and other news outlets. Traditional media has been intimidated into silence; sometimes with killings of journalists. Due to that, Mexican citizens have turned to social media and networks in order to remain informed and inform others about the safety of their communities. I have studied a large number of Twitter messages written by a community of users in Monterrey, Mexico. My findings suggest that users had to remain anonymous when providing information about risky situations but in the meantime, both the authorities and organized crime were trying to take advantage of this form of communication. The data suggests that the community changed its behavior due to external pressure. Games, Visualizations, and Experiments - Three Ways to Understand Computer Security Better (panel discussion) Founders Hall 120 Jie Han \xe2\x80\x9912, Computer Science, Economics, Marie Vasek \xe2\x80\x9912, Computer Science, and Era Vuksani \xe2\x80\x9912, Computer Science'"
"With the rising reliance on computers, computer security has emerged as a persistent and serious threat. This panel reviews three different approaches to improve the understanding of issues facing computer security. User education is key for improving Internet security, since users are frequently the target of attacks. But what is the best way to reach them? Playing video games is a popular form 11am\xe2\x80\x9312:10pm of entertainment, but could it be used as an effective tool for teaching lessons in network security? Can researchers effectively condense large quantities of security data into user-friendly charts to improve understanding and help the users themselves uncover patterns? And, ultimately, who is responsible for keeping users safe on the internet? Does reporting websites which are actively delivering badware (e.g., viruses, trojans, and spyware) actually make a measurable difference? This panel explores research projects that help provide answers to each of these questions.

"Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s S.B. 1070 and copycat legislation in other states are stirring national debate about the Mexico-U.S. border and the borders of collective identity. Many claim that these laws, intended to rid the nation of \xe2\x80\x9cillegals,\xe2\x80\x9d are not racist because \xe2\x80\x9cillegal is not a race.\xe2\x80\x9d I argue that S.B.1070, and other legislation aimed at increasing surveillance of immigrants in schools, hospitals, and rental markets, conceive of the borders of collective identity in nationalist and racist terms while simultaneously intruding into routine aspects of everyday life. The rights of immigrants, Latino/a citizens, and all citizens are at risk without a historically accurate and politically charged discussion of race at the forefront of the debate. I draw on Gloria Anzaldua\xe2\x80\x99s influential border theory to transform the discourse of race and national belonging in current immigration debates. The Social Paradox In Contemporary Korea: Exploring Korean Youth Culture (panel discussion) Science Center 104 Ji-Su Park \xe2\x80\x9913, Sociology, Political Science, Grace Song \xe2\x80\x9912, Political Science, East Asian Studies, and Sulamita Yang \xe2\x80\x9913, English and Economics'"
"and Literatures This panel explores a newly emerging, multifaceted value system in the contemporary youth culture of South Korea. On the surface, most Koreans continue to identify with and adhere to Neo-Confucian values, which have long dominated Korean society. However, as Korea is becoming increasingly globalized, recent cultural developments contradict such deep-rooted values. This social paradox is examined through diverse literature and a survey investigating how Korean and Korean-American youths identify themselves. Furthermore, focusing on gender and language use, we argue that sexual liberalization in Korean popular culture and the extensive use of expletives among youth highlight the discontinuity between the new and traditional Korean images. Changing the World We Live In (short talks) Pendleton Hall East 139 Medieval Culture, Agriculture, and Climate: A Scientific History of Human-environment Relationships Genevieve Goldleaf \xe2\x80\x9912, Medieval/Renaissance Studies and Environmental Studies'"
"The ""medieval warm period"", c. 1000\xe2\x80\x931300, provides an example of the relationships between changes in climate and in human history, when confluences between natural climatic variations improved European agricultural conditions. Environmental data contextualize the resulting economic, political, and cultural changes characterizing later medieval Europe; conversely, historical data concerning human activities during the early medieval may contribute a more complete account of possible climate drivers. For example, early medieval deforestation and agricultural expansion may have contributed greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere; changed the amount of light reflected by Earth\'s surface; or altered local hydrology, all drivers of climate trends. Tracing a more complex relationship between the natural and anthropogenic factors contributing to the medieval climate system from both historical and scientific perspectives invites us to explore the implications for contemporary narratives of climate change. Organic Synthesis of Novel Sulfur-containing Antitubercular Agents Kathryn Jackson \xe2\x80\x9913, Economics and Chemistry, and Amelia Williams \xe2\x80\x9913, History'"
"Even the most vigorous existing drugs are hardly effective in combination therapy for multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. Alarmingly, in December 2011, physicians in Hinduja, India, identified totally drug-resistant tuberculosis. Novel antimicrobials employing new mechanisms are thus urgently needed to combat resistance. The heterocyclic azole drug class is proving useful in this regard. We synthesized and examined the efficacy of a crystalline series of 1-aryl-3-(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)-thioureas generated from 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole and isothiocyanates. A second line of investigation endeavors to improve synthesis methods and drug efficacy for substituted thioamides. Modifying the classical Willgerodt-Kindler reaction permits the convenient preparation of phenylbenzothioamides from substituted benzaldehydes and aromatic amines under mild conditions. With the good availability of the starting materials and the possibility of significant structural variation, these two series of compounds have proven valuable in our program of drug discovery.

"Imagine sagebrush. Imagine more sky than you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. Imagine a solitary man on horseback, perched on a lonely ridge, with his shining silver-star badge. Perhaps less typical of a bygone era of American history, this image fits more comfortably in the canon of popular culture and of Westerns. The classic imagery of the West endures as a powerful set of tropes in American culture. Moreover, they serve as a touchstone for the creation of idealized racialized or gendered figures. Continually revisited and revised for generations, westerns serve as a site of popular historical imagination, provide a stage for the depiction of contemporary social struggles, and comprise an evolving cultural arena ripe for analysis. Blending popular culture and historical analysis, I examine the social forces that created idealized white masculinity, especially through the Texas Rangers, and contextualize the role of westerns in the construction and contestation of privilege.

"Gender Studies While feminist bioethicists have built consensus around the need to analyze intersecting identities along the lines of race, class, and gender, the role of age has been relatively untheorized. The lack of age consideration reflects oppression in the form of marginalization, which challenges elderly women\xe2\x80\x99s right to be heard. Adapting the framework of reproductive justice, I develop a notion of aging justice specific to elderly Korean American women. To understand what is necessary for aging justice, I refine feminist theory on aging by valuing the lived experiences of Korean American women and their articulations of aging with dignity and respect. Listening to the voices of those with the most intimate knowledge of their oppression enriches theory by allowing for a more culturally and contextually appropriate vision of aging justice.

The Effect of Inheritance Rules on Marriage and Dowries in India Elizabeth Gilmartin \xe2\x80\x9912, Economics'"
"The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, redefined the right for Hindu women and some others to inherit in India, mostly potentially impacting the inheritance of land which was the most valuable asset of most families. Some have asserted that dowries are an alternative way for females who are excluded from inheritance to receive some family wealth. If this is the case, one would expect that the change in the inheritance law to include women and girls to some extent could result in changes in the practice of providing dowers for Hindu women. Using some recently released data this paper will examine whether a change is quantifiable.

"In January 2002, The Boston Globe published several articles disclosing the Archdiocese of Boston\xe2\x80\x99s complicity in the sexual abuse of over 130 children by Father John Geoghan. Over the next few months, the situation worsened as hundreds of people contacted lawyers, prosecutors and the Globe claiming to have been abused as children by priests. In the wake of this scandal, tens of thousands of Catholics withheld their contributions to the archdiocese, and donations to parish collections dropped perceptibly. The financial losses the Catholic Church in Boston incurred during the clergy sexual abuse crisis are attributable to more than displeasure with the archdiocese\xe2\x80\x99s handling of sexually abusive priests. Instead, pre-existing issues within the Archdiocese of Boston and the larger Catholic Church in the United States significantly contributed to Catholic giving patterns following the crisis. 11am\xe2\x80\x9312:10pm'"
"Three photographers, Helen Levitt, Sally Mann, and Wendy Ewald, have taken the contentious history of children in art and created images that confront and compliment the tropes of the past and present. Helen Levitt\xe2\x80\x99s detached recordings of the romantic child in gritty urban tableaus serve as a connection between the idealized child of the Victorian past and the modernist potential of street photography. Sally Mann\xe2\x80\x99s ethereal and controversial portraits of her children portray the post-modern conception of children as multifaceted beings and push us to question the ethical boundaries of representation. Wendy Ewald transforms the documentation process by allowing the children to photograph; using those images she creates narratives about their communities, combining the photographer\xe2\x80\x99s and subject\xe2\x80\x99s voice in a novel way. These three photographers exemplify the diversity and the progression of methodology and representation in the depiction of children in photography. Pathway Consumption on a Budget Evelyn Haro \xe2\x80\x9913, Sociology'"
"Pierre Bourdieu\xe2\x80\x99s concept of cultural capital, first introduced in 1973, argues that class distinctions are cultivated through social conditioning and has since been revered as a cemented social truth by the academic community. This truth has often been taken to mean that working-class children are intrinsically destined to be culturally short-changed because of lacking economic resources. Through qualitative interviews, I study a group of working-class parents who have created networks of like-minded parents who have a have a socially-progressive agenda based on academic success for their children, despite having limited economic resources. My analysis examines the ways that some working-class families actively encourage upward mobility through the careful cultivation of cultural capital on a budget. This example leads us to reexamine the complicated relationship between economic and cultural forms of capital. The Making of a Classic: Louisa May Alcott, her Novels, and Modern Media Hayley Lenahan \xe2\x80\x9912, English'"
"This thesis project explores what appeals to old and new readers of Louisa May Alcott\xe2\x80\x99s works and the role that her novels have played in American society in the past 150 years. Though they were written for children, her novels liberally discuss complicated social and political issues: the roles of women, poverty, race, immigration, and education. Moreover, Alcott and her works have remained alive in their astonishingly diverse modern and contemporary adaptations from the Oscar-nominated film starring Christian Bale and Winona Ryder to annually redesigned Madame Alexander dolls to the recently published Little Women and Werewolves.

"At the age of two, Wendy learns she must grow up. ""You always know after you are two,"" the narrator claims. ""Two is the beginning of the end."" Adulthood comes with beginnings and endings \xe2\x80\x94 stories. Peter Pen represents an alternative to this pattern, an alternative imbued with frolic, mirth, and adventure \xe2\x80\x94 but also with tension, danger, and fright. When Peter Pan invades the Darling home, he takes Wendy, John, and Michael to Neverland, and their adult future grows uncertain. Peter, so vibrant and alive, is also associated with death. The novel has a darker side, one the Disney version fails to capture. In this talk, I will explore the relationship between narrative and power in J.M. Barrie\'s classic \xe2\x80\x94stories play an important role, ultimately leaving Peter powerless over the Darling children.

Students explored the intersection of multimedia as a reinterpretation of the long-standing print exchange tradition. In addition to honing their artistic vision through individual projects, students collaborated by integrating images from the vernacular print culture, and responding to and building on the creative concepts found in the works of other students. The process of making prints encourages students to work collaboratively to solve visual and technical challenges, and the result is a series of prints with shared authorship and ownership.

I want to explore these three questions: have we lost something locating ourselves? Or do we locate ourselves to prevent feeling lost or disoriented? What does it mean to be someone somewhere? Through printmaking techniques involving lithography, intaglio, and relief methods, I explore how, by combining matrices and techniques, I can construct a layered but specific answer to these questions. I play with fragments of the grid and let scraps from a culturally shared memory, pieces of personal history, and larger swaths of place and time coexist to visually investigate who and where we are.

"Steroid hormones including testosterone and estradiol are known to be growth factors involved in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Other growth factors include the peptides neurotensin and gonadotropic releasing hormone (GnRH). Prolyl-endopeptidase (PEP), an endopeptidase, which is found in prostate cancer cells, is able to break down substrates such neurotensin and GnRH. In order to determine the effect of testosterone and estradiol on the level of PEP in prostate cancer cells, androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells were treated with steroids for varying time periods. Our results indicate that the level of PEP in the cells is affected by the presence of androgens. There is a marked decrease in the level of PEP present in the cell after the cells have been exposed to dihydrotestosterone for one hour, suggesting that the effects of androgens are most felt with a limited exposure of the cells to androgens. Hormone Effects on the Enzyme Thimet Oligopeptidase in Prostate Cancer Cells Christa DeFries \xe2\x80\x9913, Biological Chemistry'"
"The enzyme thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is present throughout the body and acts on many substrates, including neuropeptides that affect production of hormones such as estrogens and androgens. In order to study TOP in systems of hormone regulation, we have treated prostate cancer cells with three different hormones: dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and 1:30\xe2\x80\x932:40pm gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The effects of these treatments on changes in TOP levels and location in the cells may help demonstrate what TOP\xe2\x80\x99s role is in such systems. To date, we have found an increase in TOP in the prostate cells after incubation with both dihydrotestosterone and estradiol, and little effect with GnRH treatment. Estradiol treatment also appears to increase nuclear TOP. (Research supported by the Roberta Day Staley and Karl A. Staley Fund for Cancer-Related Research.)

"and Nolan Flynn, Chemistry This project, in collaboration with the Flynn group, involves the development of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to be used for electrochemical assembly. Unlike assembly using biological molecules, electrochemicallydriven assembly of AuNPs is not limited by conditions such as temperature, pH, solvent, and ionic strength. The aim of this project is to create gold nanoparticles bearing hydroquinone terminal functional groups, which will be able to form an oxime linkage with nanoparticle-bound aminooxy groups, following oxidation. Here, we present research efforts toward the synthesis of a novel ethyleneglycol-thiolated hydroquinone target molecule designed to improve the solubility of the nanoparticles in aqueous solvents. This species will be used to coat the surface of AuNPs and will be linked to nanoparticle-bound aminooxy groups, thus providing a new triggering method to drive AuNP assembly.

"Habitat fragmentation can cause changes in the genetic patterns of natural populations. These include reduced genetic variation within populations, increased genetic differences between populations, and deviation from a typical isolation by distance pattern. In weevil populations endemic to Southern volcanoes in Northern Isabela, we have observed these alterations, indicating that habitat fragmentation could have affected those populations. Through the genotyping of fifteen microsatellite loci we seek to determine to what extent a change in habitat continuity could have affected populations from the more inaccessible volcanoes, Wolf and Ecuador, right at the northern tip of Isabela Island.

Thimet Oligopeptidase is Carried by Cellular Microvesicles in the Cell Culture Supernatants of Prostate Cancer Cells Yu Liu \xe2\x80\x9913, Biological Chemistry'"
"Peptidases are essential to the physiological generation and regulation of bioactive peptide signals, which mediate intercellular communication in multicellular organisms. Because the processing of peptide precursors occurs both inside and outside the cell, many peptidases must exist intracellularly and extracellularly to fully modulate peptide substrates. The pepidase enzyme thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) has been localized on the plasma membrane outer surface and in the supernatant of cell cultures. Recent advances highlight the biological relevance of microvesicles (MVs), plasma membrane bleb formations, which may carry away membrane-associated molecules (i.e. proteins) upon dissociation from the parental cell. We asked whether TOP is carried by cellular MVs and thus exist in association with MVs extracellularly, specifically for our androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Cells were treated with the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Western blot analysis revealed that TOP protein is indeed carried by the isolated cellular MVs of both untreated and DHT-treated prostate cancer cells.

"and Dora Carrico-Moniz, Chemistry Molecular oxygen plays essential roles in numerous biological transformations, ranging from oxygen transport to hydrocarbon hydroxylation. Since it is a potent oxidation catalyst, both environmentally friendly and economically viable, there have been extensive studies on the carboxylate-bridged diiron proteins, which are capable of activating dioxygen. One such enzymatic machinery is soluble methane monooxygenase system (sMMO). This enzyme catalyzes selective oxidation of methane to methanol by activating dioxygen at ambient conditions in the metabolic systems of methanotrophic bacteria. Our approach is small molecule synthetic modeling of the active site of the hydroxylate component of sMMO, where dioxygen activation is believed to occur.

"The patellins (PATLs) are Arabidopsis thaliana Sec14-related proteins that are thought to function in membrane trafficking. Recent phylogenetic studies suggest that the PATL family arose during the evolution of the first vascular plants. Furthermore, high coexpression of PATL 1 and PATL 2 with RABG3B, a protein key to vascular development, suggests that PATL proteins may be associated with this process. In order to study the role of PATL 1 and PATL 2 in vascular development, we have created double \xe2\x80\x9cknock-out\xe2\x80\x9d mutants of Arabidopsis that lack PATL 1 and PATL 2. We are currently characterizing the cotyledon venation patterns of these mutants to determine if vascular development is altered.

"Chitin is a carbohydrate polymer made from N-acetylglucosamine that is found in the cell walls and shells of a wide variety of organisms including fungi, insects and crustaceans. Many plants produce an enzyme, chitinase, to break down chitin and therefore act as a natural fungicide or insecticide. Chitinase performs its activity by cutting the glycosidic linkages connecting the individual sugar moieties in the chitin, effectively dissolving the chitin structure. To characterize chitinase activity under a range of conditions and to assess differences between enzymes derived from different sources, we purified two types of plant chitinase. This study compares purification techniques and enzymatic activity as a function of solution conditions.

"RapA protein levels in Escherichia coli cells are correlated with cellular exposure to DNA damaging agents. This protein may be a key regulator of cellular adaptation to stresses that affect chromosome integrity, topology and conformation. To begin characterizing RapA, we have cloned the rapA gene from E. coli and introduced it into a plasmid encoding a protein fusion between RapA and an affinity tag. The plasmid was transformed into a protein expression strain of E. coli and levels of RapA production as a function of transcription Induction conditions were examined by gel electrophoresis. Future studies with the purified protein will test the proposal that RapA has separate binding sites for double stranded DNA and for the single stranded RNA transcript that are vital for its regulation of cellular transcription under stress conditions.

"Amyloid protein aggregates are associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s and Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s diseases. These protein structures form insoluble fibril plaques in brain tissue. They originate from an alternative mis-folded structure acquired by an otherwise normal (native) protein in the body. Several proteins are able to adopt amyloid structures and once they do, they have the ability to induce amyloid formation in other native forms of the protein. Most protein aggregates resulting from mis-folded protein do not have common structural characteristics. Amyloids, however, form a highly conserved repetitive secondary structure. We have used a number of techniques to examine the protein folding pathways of a model system capable of forming amyloid structures and have examined the effects of solution conditions on amyloid formation.

"Speech rhythm is critical to understanding spoken word. In fact, it is one of the first features infants learn about their native language (Ramus, 2000). For my project I investigated the potential role of speech rhythm in second language acquisition. Nine native English speakers, each with an average of 3. years of German language training, were presented with recordings of sentences in German. These sentences had either natural, German-specific speech rhythm or were spoken to a regular beat. Results showed that when participants repeated these German sentences they less often made consonant-intrusion errors when sentences were presented with their natural rhythm. This finding suggests that language learning may be facilitated by language-specific speech rhythm. (Research supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation.) Modulation of Neuronal Spiking Activity in Frontal and Parietal Cortices during Auditory Detection Katie Eyring \xe2\x80\x9914, Neuroscience, and Kia Salehi \xe2\x80\x9913, Neuroscience'"
"How is a sensory stimulus translated into perception? Where does this translation occur? We began to answer these questions in rats by recording action potentials from neurons in the frontal and parietal cortices, both of which have been implicated in different aspects of sensory stimulus recognition in primates. Previous studies have produced conflicting results regarding the location of neurons associated with behavioral detection, as opposed to encoding of stimulus parameters. To address this issue, we analyzed the extent to which neurons in each cortex accurately reflected behavioral detection and presence of target stimuli while rats performed an auditory detection task, and whether the activity of these same neurons was modulated by sensory parameters of the target stimulus. Our preliminary results suggest that the sensory detection network in rat cortex may be less functionally segregated than in the primate brain.

"Attention research has drawn a distinction between bottom-up attention, which is elicited by inherently salient stimuli (e.g. a siren or flashing light) and top-down attention, which is internally driven (e.g. looking for your keys). Oscillatory power and coherence in the gamma range (30\xe2\x80\x93100 Hz), generated by the synchronized firing of many neurons, have been implicated in both bottom-up and top-down attentional processing. The purpose of my thesis is to determine if increased gamma power and coherence between the frontal and parietal cortex correlate with attention in rats. Local field potentials were recorded from these two cortical areas as rats listened to frequent and rare auditory stimuli (bottom-up attention) or performed a single-tone detection task (top-down attention). Our preliminary results support that increased frontal-parietal gamma coherence and power are associated with top-down attentional processing. (Research supported by the Jerome A.

"""More than half of all known proteins associate in some way with the cell membrane. Because of the importance of such associations, the Elmore lab uses chemical, biochemical, and computational techniques to understand the membrane interactions of the plant protein patellin and of assorted antimicrobial peptides. Patellin is a plant protein with a high binding affinity for particular phospholipids and a marked preference for PI5P. Using computational techniques, we seek to understand the basis for this affinity and extrapolate this information to other similar proteins. Antimicrobial peptides are short polypeptide sequences with the ability to kill various types of bacteria and sometimes even cancerous cells. Through investigations of histone-derived antimicrobial peptides and their mechanisms of action, we seek to determine which amino acids or structural factors lead to strong antimicrobial activity or to specific mechanisms of antimicrobial action. Social Sciences All About the Incentives (short talks) Pendleton Hall East 239 The Volunteer's Dilemma: An Evolutionary Analysis Divya Gopinath \xe2\x80\x9912, Economics and Mathematics"""
"The Volunteer\'s Dilemma is a social dilemma or public goods ""game"" in which players ""volunteer"" to contribute in order to produce a public good. Volunteering is costly, and only one volunteer is needed for all players to enjoy the full benefit of the public good. I use the tools of evolutionary game theory to explore the nature of equilibria that arise in this game. Do the players who consistently choose not to contribute tend to be evolutionarily strongest? Are volunteers typically be those who have the lowest cost of contribution? How does the size of the group effect these tendencies? The answers to these questions help us characterize the game and make predictions about the characteristics and settings that are likely to be associated with volunteerism. I then use the predictions to motivate a laboratory experiment designed to study the empirical determinants of volunteerism. How Does Mortgage Credit Affect Low-income Communities?

"The Great War ended the lives of ten million human beings and blew apart ""the beautiful lovely safe world"" (F. Scott Fitzgerald). The aftermath of the War demanded that writers, including Ernest Hemingway, create literature that broke from the customary ways of storytelling. The form of Hemingway\'s stories conveys how the War shattered ideals of love, religion, and battle. Hemingway\'s In Our Time, an experimental collection of short stories and vignettes, fragments the cohesive narrative of the novel and plays with temporality, perspective, and voice in order to represent and express the iconoclastic consequences of the War. Meanwhile A Farewell to Arms represents a more coherent narrative through the single unified consciousness of Frederic Henry, but the collapse of past and present in his retrospective narration reflects the trauma of the War and responds to Ezra Pound\'s charge to ""make it new.""

Thomas Hardy and the Modernization of Agriculture Meredith Ruhl \xe2\x80\x9912, English"""
"Through his bleak representation of mechanized agriculture at Flintcomb-Ash Farm, Thomas Hardy, in his 1891 novel Tess of the D\xe2\x80\x99Urbervilles, communicates the instability, lack of agency, and detachment from community that affect landless laborers. While the fullness of traditional rural life at Talbothays Dairy contrasts with the desolation of Flintcomb-Ash, the romanticized harmony of the dairy is limited. The alienation that characterizes modern farming later in the novel is in fact introduced while Tess is at Talbothays. My own experience working on farms drew me to examine this portrayal of nineteenth-century agriculture. Though Hardy firmly and convincingly critiques industrial agriculture in the novel, he resists the nostalgic idea that the past and the natural world offer idyllic alternatives to the unfulfilling present.

"The goal of this team is to develop a prototype Physics 107 - introductory mechanics - laboratory emphasizing key concepts and phenomena in standing waves and vibrations. Such a lab should (a) challenge students intellectually and b) communicate the physics effectively without drawing conclusions for students. We believe that when students are challenged to draw their own conclusions, they find the results more exciting and engaging, and therefore, more memorable. Using the course curriculum and other labs as a backbone structure, we aimed to design experiments that would facilitate the student\xe2\x80\x99s ability to form connections between concepts, particularly through designing complementary exercises. In the process, we considered the limitations in the apparatus and the kinds of modifications or alternatives that would be necessary for the experiment to proceed smoothly. Reconsidering Math Gender Stereotypes in a Single-Gender College Context Julia Martin \xe2\x80\x9912, Psychology and Classical Civilization'"
"Mathematics continues to be a maledominated field. According to Halpern et al. (2007), fewer women are choosing to study math in comparison to men, and under certain contexts, women are even underperforming in math relative to men (e.g. Rivardo et al., 2011; Good, Aronson, & Harder, 2008). Survey data collected from students attending Wellesley College will be examined in order to ascertain how women in a single-gender college environment (a relatively unexamined subset of the female population) perceive their performance in math and statistics courses and are affected by math gender stereotypes.

"and Connie Bauman, Physical Education, Recreation and Athletics After studying exercise physiology in New Zealand, I was inspired to design and implement an exercise physiology curriculum for Science Club for Girls, Newton Chapter. Although I had no prior teaching experience, my passion for the subject led to my quest to educate middle school girls on exercise physiology. In the fall semester, I developed a curriculum and prepared seven lesson plans for implementation by Wellesley College SLAM DUNK mentors/ teachers (Science Learning and Mentoring: Discovering and Understanding New Knowledge). Throughout the spring semester, both attitude and content assessment were administered. I will present statistical findings determining whether Science Outreach lessons had an impact on attitudes towards science and understanding of the content. By mentoring middle school girls, we not only want young females to learn about exercise physiology, but also to become more confident and engaged as emerging scientists. Relax!

"Combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an extreme response to life threatening and traumatic war experiences that can result in chronic personal disability and significant negative societal consequences (e.g., domestic violence, unemployment). Although there has been considerable progress over the past decade in understanding and treating the underpinnings of PTSD, no single intervention has demonstrated to be universally effective. Mindfulness-based approaches, derived from Buddhist meditative practices of present-centered awareness and emotional regulation, aim to address the neurobiology of PTSD rather than its physiological symptoms and comorbidities.

"Research shows that low socioeconomic status (SES) in college students predicts relatively lower grades, a higher drop-out rate, and higher levels of stress. To examine the relations between SES, stigma sensitivity, and stress levels, 126 undergraduates completed questionnaires as part of a greater study on well-being. SES was hypothesized to be negatively correlated with stigma sensitivity, and with stress levels in terms of both perceived stress and stressful life events. Stigma sensitivity was also expected to moderate the relation between SES and stress. This moderation was tested through regression analyses. None of the hypotheses were supported, except that SES was negatively correlated with stigma sensitivity. Instead, stigma sensitivity was negatively and significantly correlated with stressful life events. This implies that lower income does not cause stressful life events, but these events are related in some way to how one sees oneself in relation to one\xe2\x80\x99s peers and social situation. Friendship Satisfaction as a Moderator between Co-rumination and Stress Rebecca Richardson \xe2\x80\x9912, Psychology, and Charleen Wilder \xe2\x80\x9912, Psychology'"
"""This study examined the effects of corumination, the excessive discussion of problems within same-sex friendships, on perceived stress and the potential for friendship satisfaction to moderate this relation. Correlation and regression analyses indicated that co-rumination was not significantly correlated to perceived stress. Nor did results support the role of friendship satisfaction as a moderator in the relation between co-rumination and perceived stress. However, the authors observed positive correlations between co-rumination and both friendship satisfaction and perceived stress when only participants who reported high levels of co-rumination were considered. These results suggest that individuals who co-ruminate frequently within their friendships regard co-rumination as a positive aspect of those friendships. Consequently, co-rumination may be a protective factor within friendships even though it increases stress in individuals.

"Justice Studies History is a testament to the fact that apart from few separate cases, the Tibetan struggle has consistently adhered to nonviolent means, whether it is in the government\xe2\x80\x99s attempt at negotiation or ordinary Tibetans\xe2\x80\x99 participation in protests around the world. However, the recent series of self-immolations erupting inside Tibet questions both the prospects and sustenance of a nonviolent Tibetan movement.

Drawing from an evaluation of features that made these movements successful, the two central questions that arise are: how can we use the lessons of other movements to strengthen or reflect differently on the Tibetan struggle? What does this process reveal to us about the unique challenges and limitations that the Tibetan struggle faces. Defying ""Dirty Work"": Custodial Workers and Union Organizing at Colleges and Universities Claire Fogarty \xe2\x80\x9912, Women\'s and Gender Studies and Spanish'"
"Gender Studies In June 1990, the Justice for Janitors campaign was launched in Los Angeles when contract employees who cleaned downtown office buildings went on strike for their right to secure a union contract. After two weeks of negotiation in which protesters faced police brutality, the ""janitors"" were granted a union contract and started a nationwide movement, effecting employees in every part of the cleaning industry. Union organizing allows cleaning workers to not only improve job conditions, but also to construct occupational identities and self esteems, defying negative social perceptions surrounding their jobs.

"""and Donna Patterson, Africana Studies Julius Malema is perhaps one of the most contentious figures in modern South African politics. He is beloved by the ANC's grassroots base of poor and underprivileged South Africans and he is simultaneously ridiculed and disdained by South Africa's politically powerful elites. My paper argues that Malema's rise to power has been prompted by distinct factors such as a vacuum of leadership within the ANC, service delivery issues as well as dissatisfaction amongst the country's youngest generations and the poor. Julius Malema is a major public figure in South Africa; he has the ability to stir the poor majority into a potentially violent revolt against the status quo. The rise of Julius Malema as a popular political figure illustrates deeper issues within the South African political and economic climate and the country's desire for tangible change.

"Liberalism theoretically supports and advocates for the assimilation of minority groups into society. However, the United States has historically been unable to robustly incorporate others into its master narrative used to explain the American history and experience. The cultures of minority groups are frequently oversimplified and reduced to benign narratives that support this American redemption narrative. In order to create a cohesive narrative, events like the Civil Rights Movement are recast as the triumph of American ideals. Authors such as Gloria Anzald.a re-appropriate cultural myths and legends in order to reclaim a forgotten identity and subvert the primacy of the American master narrative. I will look at the effects of such re-appropriation narratives on American liberalism.

I focus on how English propagandists presented Ireland, Scotland, France, and the Dutch Republic in their writings and demonstrations to impact and influence political sentiments regarding domestic issues, such as religion, toleration, and the rights of the monarchy. By examining the extent to which allusions to foreign political, religious, and ideological issues appeared in various popular media forms (i.e. sermons, pamphlets, etc.), this thesis investigates how international concerns shaped the domestic struggles and debates of the late seventeenth century in England. Watch Your Language (short talks) Pendleton Hall West 117 Identifying Idiosyncratic Phonemes in Korean-English Bilinguals: Production of Constructed Vowels Yoolim Kim \xe2\x80\x9912 Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences'"
"""Linguistic Sciences This research studies the phenomenon of Korean-English bilinguals producing errors in both their first and second languages (L1 and L2). Pronunciation errors occur because of differences in acceptable sounds in each language or in allowable sound combinations. Native Koreans learning English, for example, have difficulty differentiating between /\xce\xb5/ and /./ due to a lack of distinction in Korean. Therefore, words such as 'pen' and 'pan' prove difficult for learners. While errors in the L2 are accountable, pronunciation errors in the L1 are more unusual. To investigate L1 pronunciation errors, I analyze vowel production, studying \xe2\x80\x9cmelded\xe2\x80\x9d vowels created by a combination of Korean and English phonemes. I posit that certain Korean-English bilinguals demonstrate incomplete acquisition of both L1 and L2 phonologies, combining incomplete phonemic inventories to complete one inventory specific to that individual that is not fully characteristic of either L1 or L2, but still contains sounds from both. 3\xe2\x80\x934:10pm Rapid Prototyping for Everyone Ana Smaranda Sandu \xe2\x80\x9914, Computer Science and Mathematics"""
"""Picture Blocks is a visual programming environment I developed this past year that enables users with no previous programming experience to create programs that generate intricate patterns by composing and transforming simple pictures. In Picture Blocks, users construct programs by snapping together jigsaw-like blocks, thereby avoiding many of the syntactic problems (missing semicolons, misspelled words, etc.) that frustrate novices using textual programming languages. The resulting patterns can easily be cut/engraved in wood and plastic by a laser cutter or cut out of cardstock and vinyl by a vinyl cutter. I have used PictureBlocks to explore making these two rapid prototyping machines in Wellesley's Engineering Studio more accessible to members of the Wellesley community. In addition to creating interesting physical artifacts, users of PictureBlocks are exposed to fundamental concepts in geometry and programming.

"Ted Gibson, Brain and Cognitive Sciences (MIT) The \xe2\x80\x9cnoisy channel\xe2\x80\x9d model of language predicts that in human cognition, boundaries between syntax and semantics are less important than a listener\xe2\x80\x99s ability to infer an utterance\xe2\x80\x99s meaning. Because neural activity generates voltage changes on the scalp, researchers can use this electrical activity to gain insight into cognition. Similar events generate characteristic voltage changes, called event-related potentials (ERP). For example, the P600 ERP component has historically been identified with syntactic processing. However, the noisy channel model deemphasizes syntax, and so predicts the cognitive activity generating the P600 is not processing syntax but rather inferring meaning when an utterance is likely an error. I have recorded ERPs evoked by sentences with the last word replaced by a phonologically similar word likely to be an error. This presentation will describe these results and their implications for language. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship.) Improving Types in Block-based Programming Languages Marie Vasek \xe2\x80\x9912, Computer Science'"
"In blocks programming languages, such as Scratch and App Inventor, programs are created by connecting visual program fragments shaped like jigsaw puzzle pieces. The shapes of these blocks help novices avoid frustrating syntax errors commonly encountered in textual programming languages by strongly suggesting how pieces fit together. In statically typed programming languages, every expression has a type that indicates the kind of value it denotes (e.g. number, string, boolean). The shapes of block connectors can be used to indicate type, but existing block languages handle only simple types and do so in an ad hoc and confusing fashion. Inspired by the expressive type system of the ML programming language, I developed a statically typed blocks language for a functional language with list, tuple, and function types where each arbitrarily complex type is represented by a unique connector shape.

"Education has the power both to preserve traditions and to challenge them, and this is nowhere more evident than in the writing of the second-century Greek satirist Lucian. Lucian wrote during a period when education (paideia in ancient Greek) was an important marker of social status as well as a means of preserving the past. As a native Syrian, as opposed to ethnic Greek, his place in elite Greek-speaking society was dependent upon proving that he was educated, and he does this by drawing extensively from traditional classics of Greek literature and rhetoric. However, his works also reflect awareness of his status as an outsider and of the gap between the idealized past and present reality. In pieces such as Somnium (The Dream), Lucian cleverly subverts traditional themes and allusions in ways that question the validity of his self-representation and of paideia as an instrument of social status. 3\xe2\x80\x934:10pm 4:30\xe2\x80\x935:40pm The Diffusion of Luxury in Ancient Rome Mannat Johal \xe2\x80\x9912, Classical Civilization'"

Gender-bending imagery, spiritual love, and submissive acceptance of violence are characteristic of both male and female Christian martyrs. Despite the seemingly brazen acts of the main female character, in no way can this story be claimed as a feminist text. Instead, the sadistic image of the non-Christians is meant to highlight their enslavement to worldly passions, while the almost masochistic image of Thecla, as a martyr and as a woman, reveals her desire to sublimate her identity into the body of Christ.

"During WWII, France lost 25% of its Jewish population. While French leaders after the war focused on the 75% of Jews saved during the war, history sees these statistics as a failure. The issue is not how many Jews Vichy saved but rather how many Jews Vichy ostracized, abandoned and deported. Without any German influence, the Vichy Regime passed anti-Semitic legislation that stripped French Jews of their citizenship and allowed for the internment and deportation of foreign Jews to camps in Eastern Europe. Post WWII, the French, united around a myth of a heroic French resistance, believed the crimes committed by Vichy were German crimes.

"Sharon Gobes, Neuroscience Songbirds, zebra finches in particular, provide an especially useful cognitive model for the acquisition of human speech due to the many parallels between bird song and human speech. One of the most notable similarities we share with songbirds is a sensitive learning period dependent on auditory experience and feedback. Our laboratory is conducting a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed at identifying the areas of the brain involved in song acquisition in our model organism, Taeniopygia guttata. With our micro-MRI system we have acquired well-resolved anatomical images of anesthetized birds. Our investigation of various pulse sequences will enable effective use of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI and other potential imaging techniques. Other challenges in this new study include recording and play-back of sound in the MRI for our preliminary experiments and developing an experimental paradigm appropriate for this unique study.

"Engineering for Humanity, an interdisciplinary engineering design and anthropology course, is a semester-long partnership between Three-College students and the Councils on Aging in Needham and Wellesley. Each year, older community members are recruited to partner with students in a series of discovery, design, and community-building activities. Come hear Wellesley and Olin student presentations and see the results of the empathetic design process. During the semester, students and their elder partners engaged in activities designed to create community and understanding. Next, students synthesized what they learned into project ideas, refining these briefs into robust, targeted, and manageable projects through consultation with experts and co-design with elder partners.

"The CBO estimates that total expenditures on health care in the US will rise to nearly 50 percent of GDP by 2082.

Recently, many politicians have espoused tort reform as a ""safe"" method of cutting health care costs because it reduces physicians\xe2\x80\x99 liability and, in turn, the probability of their practicing defensive medicine. But, is this true? Can tort reform lower costs without endangering patients? Two seminal studies, focusing on obstetrics and cardiology, suggest that, in some cases, tort reform may do just the opposite, i.e., raise treatment intensity without improving patient outcomes.

"On September 11, 1973, General Augosto Pinochet Ugarte led the coup that ousted the first-ever elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende.

Thus, either the account must be modified (to avoid this result) or it must be shown that the downing case is an instance of silencing after all. Humanities\t"""
"Chinese culture has exerted an enormous impact on other East Asian countries throughout history. Confucianism is one of the most striking Chinese influences among East Asia. This presentation will focus on the spread of Confucianism from China to Japan and Korea, and how Confucianism is demonstrated through Chinese, Japanese and Korean literature. We will introduce the origin and basic ideas of Confucianism in China, and the development of Neo- Confucianism in Korea and Japan in the 17th and 18th century. By comparing the traditional literature novels in China, Japan and Korea, this presentation will give a general analysis of the similarities and differences of the influence of Confucianism in these three East Asian countries.'"
"While living in Varanasi, India, I discovered the Awadhi poet Tulsidas\xe2\x80\x99 Ramcharitmanas, a popular retelling of the Ramayana, the Hindu epic tale of Prince Rama\xe2\x80\x99s adventures. People often quote, recite, and perform scenes from the poem \xe2\x80\x93 once I heard it being recited for over twenty four hours to bless a newly built home. Most memorably the Ramcharitmanas is performed during Ramlilas (reenactments of the story of Rama) which are often timed to end on the festival of Vijayadashami to celebrate the victory of Lord Rama over the demon Ravana. This fall, I spent the semester translating excerpts from Ramcharitmanas, learning the language Awadhi and analyzing the metrical structures of the poem.

"The plant vascular system accomplishes an incredible feat of carrying water and nutrients, sometimes for hundreds of kilometers. Vascular patterns must be rigid enough to supply the organism with vital water and nutrients, but also flexible enough to account for environmental changes. This self-assembling network begins to lay the groundwork during early embryogenesis when the embryo is patterned with procambial cells. The coordination of this replicable, yet adaptable pattern de novo in each leaf is associated with auxin hormone domains which predict the procambial cell differentiation. The patellins (PATLs) are Arabidopsis thaliana Sec14-related proteins that are thought to function in membrane trafficking (Peterman 2004).

Previous work using RT-PCR and Western blotting has established the high level expression of the transmembrane glycoprotein A33 (gpA33) in the CAPAN-2 PDAC cells and the absence of gpA33 in the BxPC-3 PDAC cells. This differential protein expression allows for an experimental setup in which uptake of AuNPs conjugated with anti-gpA33 antibodies between CAPAN-2 and BxPC-3 tumors can be quantified and compared in vivo. Using an ex ovo avian embryo culture, specific targeting of our current antibody-conjugated AuNP construct to CAPAN-2 xenografts has been demonstrated.'"

Using an AML cell line known to contain two driver mutation, c-KIT and AML1-ETO, I used a group of drugs known to specifically impair the function of one or the other of the mutations. After confirming the efficacy of the drugs on their own, different combinations of drugs targeting each mutation were tested for any additive or synergistic effects. My findings indicate higher cell death rates of cancer cells with multiple drug combinations.'"

"Gravitational waves are distortions in the fabric of space-time caused by the acceleration of masses, such as rotating black hole binaries. Their existence was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, but they have yet to be detected because their predicted effects are extremely small. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO) is attempting to detect cosmic gravitational waves. My experiment involves the design of the mirrors for the Third Generation LIGO. At the LIGO Lab at MIT, I am investigating the feasibility of using radiative cooling of silicon mirror substrates to 120 K to reduce thermal noise, which should greatly increase the sensitivity of the detector. I will also explore the effect of high emissivity coatings used in radiative cooling on the mechanical Q of the mirror, which is important because low mechanical damping is necessary for reducing fluctuations in the mirror positions.'"

"The P3 is a component of the average EEG response to sensory stimuli that is believed to reflect attentional and memory processing. Because the P3 response in humans is altered in a number of neurological disorders, it is important to understand its generators.

"Neonatal stroke is a major cause of infant death and permanent neuropsychological injury. Recently, the early response gene \xe2\x80\x9cverge\xe2\x80\x9d has been identified as highly active in the adult mouse brain post-stroke and during angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels. Verge mRNA expression increases threefold in the affected hemisphere of mice. In this study, 10-day-old mice with the verge gene (wild-type) and those without (knock-out) were used as a model of the human infant to test the hypothesis that verge improves stroke outcomes and angiogenesis in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Immunofluorescence studies were conducted to measure expression of CD105, an angiogenesis marker, and cresyl violet staining was performed to measure brain atrophy at different time points post-stroke. Verge knock-out brains retained a cyst while wild type brains experienced less damage, suggesting that verge serves as a neuroprotective agent in stroke.

"Many bacterial species, including the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. Strain PCC 6803, use the formation of biofilms as a survival mechanism. Biofilms are cell aggregates, which act as a protective barrier by providing nutrient access, increased drug tolerance and metabolic by-product sharing. Biofilms can form both in nature and in human infections, where they are very antibiotic resistant and thus particularly difficult to treat. To form biofilms, many bacterial species use a communication system involving chemical signals. In this study, we investigate the cell-cell communication of this cyanobacterium. The physical structure of the biofilms is also being analyzed. The wild type non-motile cells form a uniform monolayer biofilm while the super-motile mutant cells form pillar shaped biofilms that spread across the surface. Our goal is to gain a better understanding of this ubiquitous and diverse bacterial survival strategy. (Research supported by a Jerome A. Schiff Fellowship).'"
"Biofilms are how bacteria naturally exist in nature--enclosed in an extracellular matrix of protein and polysaccharides. The biofilm state protects bacteria against environmental stressors, such as antibiotics and biocides. Confocal microscopy was used to analyze the development of biofilms of two strains of Synechocystis sp. strain 6803, a wildtype and motile mutant, which were grown in flow cells. A significant difference was found in terms of their biofilm structures and growth, with wildtype biofilms being lower in height and not exhibiting dense clusters compared to the motile strain. The genomes of both strains were sequenced and then characterized for genetic differences. We also explored the ability of the motile mutant to move towards light, known as positive phototaxis. Our goal was to find the physical conditions required for maximal positive phototaxis in the motile strain.

"The regulation of the timing of developmental transitions, such as metamorphosis and puberty, is poorly understood. POU domain transcription factors have been associated with the regulation of endocrine changesassociated with the onset of puberty. To see if the POU transcription factor Ventral vein lacking (Vvl) plays a role in insect metamorphosis, Vvl was silenced in the flour beetle Triboliumcastaneum. Silencing Vvl expression resulted in precocious metamorphosis and a reduction in kruppel homolog 1 (kr-h1), a target of the key insect metamorphosis regulator Juvenile hormone (JH). However, topical application of JH on Vvl knockdown larvae delayed the onset of metamorphosis and rescued the normal expression of kr-h1. Since the expression of JH acid methyltransferase, a JH biosynthesis enzyme, also decreased with vvl knockdown, Vvl likely regulates JH levels. Thus, POU factors may play a role in regulating the timing of developmental transitions in both vertebrates and insects.

"Peptidases are enzymes essential to the physiological generation and regulation of bioactive peptide signals, which mediate intercellular communication in multicellular organisms. Because the processing of peptide precursors occurs both inside and outside the cell, many peptidases must exist intracellularly and extracellularly to fully modulate their peptide substrates. The peptidase enzyme thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) has been localized on the plasma membrane outer surface and in the supernatant of cell cultures. Recent studies highlight the significance of microvesicles (MVs), plasma membrane bleb formations, as extracellular carriers of membrane-associated molecules (i.e. proteins) upon dissociation from the parental cell. We asked whether extracellular TOP is carried by cellular MVs. Western blot analysis revealed that TOP protein is indeed carried by the cellular MVs of androgen sensitive prostate cancer cells. Additionally, treating these cells with a calcium-ionophore (a compound that allows Ca2+ to enter cells) induced dose-dependent increase in MV release and extracellular MV-associated TOP expression.'"

"""My senior thesis grapples with the issues raised in Euripides' Orestes by staging it for a modern audience. The play engages with Aeschylus' Agamemnon; it is concerned with the same themes but gives them a radically different treatment. Euripides empties the Aeschylean 'house' of its symbolic content, traditionally the aristocratic family. Accordingly, Euripides' language is more concrete than Aeschylus', and his plot is driven by exterior rather than interior events. I bring out both qualities in my production of Orestes, which I staged in an original translation in April. The performance manifests onstage the most challenging aspects of Euripides' text and argues for the play's departure from tragic convention by staging the absence of an interior and employing the 'unreliable narrator' technique as a proxy for Euripides' play with genre. It also includes musical and scenic effects designed to bring the Greek tragic stage to a modern audience. (Project supported by a Daniels Fellowship)"""

Rap music is a poetics and a politics in which construction of oppositional narratives and presentation and performances of race, gender, and sexuality is possible. The works of hip hop artists Azealia Banks, Frank Ocean, Las Krudas, and Big Freedia particularly illuminate the processes of identity formation and presentation.

"Turkey has been lauded in the West as an exemplary country where Islam and democracy coexist within the framework of a secular government. Recently, however, citizens and politicians alike have challenged the restrictions placed on religious practice, most visibly in the ongoing ""headscarf debate"". The debate concerns laws banning religious symbols from government space, including the headscarves common in traditional Turkish culture and among observant Muslim women. Because the ban encompasses the legislature and public universities, it forces women to choose between their religious beliefs and their education or political involvement. Many argue this violates their freedom of religion, and is detrimental to democracy; others argue that the ban and similar restrictions are the only way to preserve the secular Republic. The headscarf debate is part of a dialogue that may deter- mine the future of secularism in Turkey. Humanities\t'"
"In his late teens and early twenties, Ernest Hemingway began his professional writing career with newspaper articles for the Kansas City Star and the Toronto Star.

"""Merging literature and visual art, artist\xe2\x80\x99s books reveal the fascinating experiment between word and image.

"My Art History thesis focuses on Dominican friar Fra Girolamo Savonarola (1452- 1498) and his role in popular religion in Renaissance Florence. He delivered sermons at San Marco, San Lorenzo, and the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, to audiences of as many as 20,000. His preaching took advantage of contemporary crises, such as plague and famine, and achieved notoriety through his prophesies of spiritual renewal for the entire church. Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s sermons were circulated in the form of early printed books with woodcut illustrations. The woodcuts expressed his awareness of death as a lurking evil, ready to attack at the first sign of weakness; Savonarola told his followers to keep these woodcuts in their homes as a reminder of the inevitability of one\xe2\x80\x99s passing. Ultimately, they proved to be a crucial aspect of Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s control over Florence.'"
"""The sculptural practice of Adri\xc3\xa1n Villar Rojas (b.

"Over 100 million people worldwide are exposed to excessive amounts of arsenic through drinking arsenic-contaminated groundwater. Many Asian countries, in particular, are known for elevated arsenic level in their estuarine system. Previous studies have been focused on the transport mechanisms and public health effects in the sediment environment. Identifying the sources of arsenic and the initial process that removes arsenic from its origin is equally crucial for us to estimate arsenic distribution and to design prevention schemes. This study focuses on the a wide range of existing literature on Southeast Asia and East Asian countries with historically reported high arsenic in groundwater. Aside from the anthropogenic factors, it is hypothesized that the weathering of arsenic-bearing mineral phases in the Himalayas serves as the primary Arsenic reservoir for Ganges\xe2\x80\x93Brahmaputra and the Mekong deltas in Southeast Asia.

"Little is known about how color is encoded in the brain. One possible encoding mechanism uses the timing of a neural response to a stimulus to convey information about hue, saturation, or luminance. Latency is one metric of the temporal dynamics of neurons, and is also used to assess the stage of a given neuron within the visual-processing hierarchy. We examined response latencies of visually responsive cells in macaque V4/PIT following presentation of visual stimuli varying in hue, saturation and luminance. We test the hypothesis that stimuli of high luminance contrast produce shorter latencies, as has been found for neurons in other visual areas. We also assess the differences in response latency to stimuli of identical luminance but different saturation and hue, to test the possibility that these dimensions are encoded by temporal dynamics. Preliminary results show latency to be inversely related to saturation.Neuroprotective Agents: understanding female Sex Hormone Action in Diabetic Neuropathy Sarah D. Finkelstein \xe2\x80\x9914, Neuroscience'"
"Sixty percent of diabetics develop some form of diabetic-neuropathy. Diabetic-neuropathy is the neuronal death of peripheral nerves, such as the sciatic nerve, due to the degradation of myelin, the protective protein surrounding the nerves. Schwann cells produce myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Interestingly, progesterone, an ovarian steroid hormone, causes an increased production of an important protein in myelin by binding to progestin receptors (PR) and recruiting steroid receptor coactivators, such as SRC-2. Estradiol, another steroid hormone, mediates the expression of PR in steroid- sensitive tissues. My study investigates whether PR are estradiol-induced in the female rat sciatic nerve using antibodies that tag PR and SRC-2 in the sciatic nerve of rats treated with estradiol. Co-localization of PR and SRC-2 in the same cell provides neuroanatomical evidence for their interaction and will enhance our understanding of the protective role of progestins in diabetic- neuropathy in females.'"
"Phenotypic plasticity describes the ability of a genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to the environment. When a discrete switch exists in the phenotypes produced in response to a continuously varying environmental input, the plastic trait is known as a polyphenism. Developmental hormones, such as ecdysone and juvenile hormone (JH), are known to control polyphenisms, but the origins of poly-phenisms remain poorly understood. Ventral abdominal spot patterning of Oncopeltus fasciatus, the milkweed bug, is an example of a temperature-dependent phenotypically plastic trait. Using double-stranded RNA injections, we knocked down the expression of the Hox genes abdominal-A (abd-A) and Abdominal-B (Abd- B), JH receptor Methoprene-tolerant (Met), and nuclear hormone receptors Ecdysone receptor (EcR) and Fushi tarazu factor-1 (FTZ-F1) to explore the genetic and hormonal mechanisms of abdominal pigmentation.

"Juvenile malnourishment affects learning and task performance in many species but is poorly studied in invertebrates. We examined the effect of such stress on the foraging performance of an economically important model invertebrate, the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Pollen, which supplies essential nutrients to developing honey bee larvae, is often in short supply in colonies because of seasonal dearths or intensive management practices. However, it is not known how pollen deprivation during larval development affects the performance of honey bee workers as adults. We compared foraging behavior between groups of workers that were reared under conditions of either pollen abundance or deprivation. Longevity, onset of foraging, and time spent waggle dancing by workers were compared between treatment groups. Our study provides insight into the role that nutritional state during larval development plays in the health and function of honey bees and their colonies. (Brachman-Hoffman Grant and Janina A.

With a strong preference towards host mucus and scales, cleaners sometimes cheat and take a bite out of the host. In summer 2012, I studied the behavioral choices of blue streak cleaner wrasse in Hoga Island, Indonesia by documenting cleaner wrasse activities through underwater videos and utilizing benthic survey data. I used market theory to explain the actions and choices made by the cleaners, and to elaborate on how the cleaner-host interaction may have been maintained over time.'"
"Within the Chesapeake Bay, flatworms are recognized as common predators of barnacles and oysters. Historically, the two main flatworm species, Euplana gracilis and Stylochus ellipticus, have been grouped together due to a difficulty to distinguish one from another. Although S. ellipticus has been extensively studied because of its impacts on commercially valuable oysters, little is known about E. gracilis. We elucidated the differences between these two flatworms. We focused primarily on the predator-prey interactions of E. gracilis and its commonly encountered benthic prey species in Chesapeake Bay. Our results indicate voracious predation on Apocorophium lacustre, a common tube-building amphipod found along the Atlantic coast. We found a positive relationship between flatworm size and consumption rates. Tubes constructed by amphipods provided no refuge from predation. This is the first reported occurrence of estuarine/marine flatworm predation on amphipods, and makes clear the trophicimportance of this abundant, although overlooked, predator.'"
"Fish show a high degree of variability in escape behavior, particularly in regard to their chosen direction of escape relative to a threat. In most individuals, escape angles cluster around two or three preferred directions. This may be a behavioral strategy that limits the predictability of escape behavior. It may also be driven by underlying biomechanical constraints; this being the case, there may be performance benefits associated with the preferred trajectories. To test this we compared performance, as indicated by peak velocity, peak acceleration, and distance moved, between escapes performed at preferred versus infrequently chosen directions. There were no differences in performance in relation to escape angle. This suggests that the observed escape angle distribution is largely associated with behavioral factors, rather than dictated by proximate factors relating to escape performance.'"

"Despite studies performed on many species, including amphibians and insects, the mechanisms regulating limb regeneration remain poorly understood. Hedgehog (HH) is a major signaling pathway found in most, if not all, animal species, including humans. In vertebrates, HH signaling has been shown to play key roles during limb regeneration. To determine whether Hedgehog might also play a role during limb regeneration in Tribolium castaneum, HH signaling was silenced through RNA interference. HH silencing resulted in a complete loss of leg and antenna regeneration, indicating that the HH signaling pathway is necessary for the initiation of regeneration. Specifically, HH appears to be necessary for the growth of the blastema that forms at the ablation site. Studies on the role of Hedgehog in blastema proliferation and re-patterning of regenerating legs are currently underway. Overall, our findings suggest that HH signaling is a conserved mechanism for appendage development and limb regeneration across Metazoa.'"

In addition to these factors, the political economy of gender inequality plays a crucial role in explaining why women are particularly vulnerable in post-disaster settings. Using a political economy framework to evaluate post-Haiti earthquake, South Asian tsunami disaster, Sri Lanka Tsunami disaster, and Hurricane Katrina, I will discuss the gendered impact of natural disasters. Its implications for gender-sensitive planning recommendations will also be discussed. Chinese Women leaders Against oppression Elizabeth Torres \xe2\x80\x9914Women\xe2\x80\x99s and Gender Studies'"
"This paper is based upon an analysis of interviews collected by Professor Hertz about the lives of women founders of various NGOs in China. Along with historic events including, the Cultural Revolution, Tiananmen Square and the World Women\xe2\x80\x99s Forum, I will draw a parallel between the history of these NGOs and that of China. By studying these three generations of NGO women leaders who challenged organizational and cultural norms, I show how people or women who became leaders in China gained agency and learned how to navigate the Chinese government system, how to garner support, and how to lobby for the people they served. I suggest that it is the experiences they underwent \xe2\x80\x93 not their personality -- that motivated them to become leaders. Therefore, my research lobbies for the historical, cultural, and gendered impacts of \xe2\x80\x9cexperienced struggles\xe2\x80\x9d undergone by these women.'"
"Jamaica\xe2\x80\x99s national motto is \xe2\x80\x9cOut of Many, One People.\xe2\x80\x9d This aphorism embodies the diverse populations of people that identify with the Jamaican heritage. However, gender-based issues on the island arise out of the lack of representation of women in positions of power and an increased rate of sexual assault and gender-based violence. This gender-based violence is, in part, a result of the normalization of a hyper form of masculinity within Jamaican society. Returning to the country during Wintersession helped me gain insight into the manifestations of this female marginalization and the feminist movement on the island attempting to redress these gender-based issues. As a Jamaican-born United States citizen, I have the unique experience of studying Jamaican culture through the lens of both an outsider and a partial member of the society, a positionality that allows for a complex analysis of gender in this Caribbean country.'"

"Hashtags have been used since 2008 to organize and catalog \xe2\x80\x9ctweets\xe2\x80\x9d on Twitter, but in recent years, their use has expanded beyond this social media service. In our presentation, we will discuss how Wellesley students use hashtags on Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr. We proposed four reasons for using hashtags: to promote the visibility of an idea, product, or cause; to comment on a previous statement; to make content searchable; and as a means of self-identification. Given the functional differences among the three platforms, we hypothesized that Wellesley College students would use hashtags differently depending on the social media site. While our results did not yield statistically significant differences in reasons for using hashtags, we did find patterns in rates of hashtag use between multiple platforms users and single-site users. These patterns highlight differences in hashtag use between casual and active users of social media. Queering Sociolinguistics \xe2\x80\x93 What Heterosexual marketplace?

"Shipwrecks in the Western Mediterranean are a valuable but complex source of evidence of Archaic exchange. The wrecks yield information about the goods being traded and potential exchange routes. However, the variety of content and scale of the cargos, in addition to loss of material caused by looting and 2,500 years under water, complicate the interpretation of the archaeological evidence. My senior thesis examines the nature of early exchange between Greeks, Etruscans, and indigenous populations of the Western Mediterranean through the lens of Etrusco-Corinthian fineware pottery as a non-subsistence commodity. In comparison with other shipwrecks, the Pointe Lequin 1A shipwreck has an exceptionally large quantity of fineware pottery. Consequently, the wreck can be used as a unique case study in order to consider fineware pottery and its place in early exchange.

"Good nonsense creates a multitude of tensions; it complicates the relationships of syntax and language, meaning and interpretation, and, in the question of its origins, literature and folklore. In spite of a significant body of medieval nonsense in both drama and poetry, most criticism erroneously treats \xe2\x80\x9cliterary nonsense\xe2\x80\x9d as a discrete Victorian phenomenon. Other critical veins emphasize nonsense\xe2\x80\x99s universality\xe2\x80\x94though deeply intertwined with human psychology, the medieval and folkloric nonsense tradition relates to the Victorian much more concretely. This connection has not yet been grounded in literary, academic analysis; I forge this connection this thesis. Overlooking the distinctly literary historical traditions embedded in modern nonsense oversimplifies the genre, inappropriately diminishing the continual literary relevance of medieval nonsense. Using the appearances of nonsense in medieval performance as a contextualizing lens, I elucidate the relationship of medieval nonsense to Victorian, particularly through conserved folkloric motifs and a performance-derived spirit of celebration.

Scholars have long wondered why. Examining the plays reveals important dissimilarities between these men, their partners, and their relationships, and as the plot and the characters unfold, the couples are driven towards diverse endings.

"Once mingled, science and poetry diverged as our understanding of the world sharpened and advanced. Now considered antitheses, these two types of thought rarely meet. The poems of Marianne Moore and A.R. Ammons undermine this widely-held opinion by demonstrating how science can function as a means of communication. Without sacrificing the merits and cultural purposes of poetry, both these poets fully integrated scientific vocabulary and concepts into their poems. Despite their shared scientific regard, Moore and Ammons\xe2\x80\x99 works differ greatly. Moore wished to communicate the idea of observable but ineffable principles, and turned to science to compensate for the failings she perceived in language. Her post-modern successor Ammons demonstrated an infallible faith in language, viewing scientific jargon as simply another list of words to be used in the verbal capture of his observed surroundings.

While no one denies that Henry IV is a rich play both critically and theatrically, arguments regarding its protagonist and genre are far more contentious: Hal is the only possible lead, or his father is, the play is just a comedy, or just a tragedy. But in each case, both are, or at least can be, true. So we attempted to maintain the dynamic balance of Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s text in performance: rather than choosing one of four major characters to feature in the lead role (either Hal, Henry, Hotspur, or Falstaff) or between genres to elevate (namely drama, comedy, or tragedy), we tried not to choose.

"Biofilms are how bacteria naturally exist in nature- -enclosed in an extracellular matrix of protein and polysaccharides. The biofilm state protects bacteria against environmental stressors, such as antibiotics and biocides. Confocal microscopy was used to analyze the development of biofilms of two strains of Synechocystis sp. strain 6803, a wildtype and motile mutant, which were grown in flow cells. A significant difference was found in terms of their biofilm structures and growth, with wildtype biofilms being lower in height and not exhibiting dense clusters compared to the motile strain.

"Many bacterial species, including the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. Strain PCC 6803, use the formation of biofilms as a survival mechanism. Biofilms are cell aggregates, which act as a protective barrier by providing nutrient access, increased drug tolerance and metabolic by-product sharing. Biofilms can form both in nature and in human infections, where they are very antibiotic resistant and thus particularly difficult to treat. To form biofilms, many bacterial species use a communication system involving chemical signals. In this study, we investigate the cell-cell communication of this cyanobacterium. The physical structure of the biofilms is also being analyzed. The wild type non-motile cells form a uniform monolayer biofilm while the super-motile mutant cells form pillar shaped biofilms that spread across the surface. Our goal is to gain a better understanding of this ubiquitous and diverse bacterial survival strategy. Research supported by a Jerome A. Schiff Fellowship.'"

"The crayfish Procambarus clarkii is capable of neuronal production in the adult brain. The lineage of neuronal precursors produces cells that will differentiate into olfactory interneurons. However, the 1st-generation neuronal precursors (stem cells) are not self- renewing, and we are therefore hunting for the source that replenishes these stem cells. Our evidence suggests that the hematopoietic system is one source of these cells. Our specific projects therefore focus on defining the relationship between the hematopoietic system and the lineage of cells producing the adult-born neurons. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, is known to increase the niche cell population. The goals of current research projects are to (1) define the circadian rhythm of serotonin production in the brain using high performance liquid chromatography, (2) test the relationship between the number of hemocytes (blood cells) and niche cells, and (3) characterize cells in the hematopoietic system that are believed to provide the neuronal precursors.'"

I interviewed 82 preschoolers twice about their friendships and observed the children to see who frequently played together. Teachers also completed questionnaires on social competence and relationships characteristics.

I argue that feminist philosophy breaks from traditionalist views of freedom\xe2\x80\x94especially classical liberal views\xe2\x80\x94and instead is derived from a modern post-structuralist viewpoint in which liberation from essence, as opposed to perfection of essence, is a required component of freedom for individuals.

We will primarily be focusing on two of China\xe2\x80\x99s growing metropolises-- Beijing, the country\xe2\x80\x99s political capital, and Shanghai, China\xe2\x80\x99s economic center. We will begin with a discussion about the human rights violations surrounding the Beijing 2008 Olympics and segue into the changes both the city and its people have undergone since China\xe2\x80\x99s momentous unveiling to the world. We will then move to Shanghai where we will explore, through various novels and films, the effect commercialization has had on youth culture and self-identity. Ultimately, we will delve into the ideas of femininity, generational gaps, materialism, sexuality, and foreign influence in order to present a more comprehensive image of an ever- changing China.'"
"Last Spring, I conducted an independent research project where I examined the cultural practice of honor killings, specifically focusing on the ones being committed in the United States. I reviewed scholarly articles, watched documentaries featuring victims and their families as well as interviewed two sociologists who are familiar with this field. The culmination of my research is a short film which presents all views expressed publicly in the United States about this horrific practice. It is meant to be informational and demonstrate how little America has yet to discover about how to prevent these murders from occurring in the future.'"
