A pegmatitic allanite with bulk composition: Cau , (Lao 22Ce-Ndo ,Smo o,Pro 03Tho 02l (Fe ,  o s, Fe '+ 0 42 M8o 05Mn0 06 Ti0 06) Al1 63Si2 98012 (0H1 12) was used to study the iron-oxy substitution, Fe>+ + Off = Fe3+ + O' + l/2H2 (1), in allanites  This research examined the feasibility of relating the Off content of igneous allanite to the water content of the melt from which it crystallized  An experimental framework was established to determine fH2 (effective partial pressure of hydrogen) of the sample as a function of ferric/ferrous iron content and temperature at the time of crystallization  By estimating f02 independently, the activity product of water can be derived and the water content of the melt then determined  The evidence also suggests that REE incorporation into the allanite crystal structure is controlled by the iron-oxy substitution mechanism  Such work could lead to the development of a geohygrometer and increase understanding of volatiles in melts and mechanisms of volcanism.

An individual grows by cell proliferation  Subsequently, cells differentiate into discrete cell types  When a cell loses its ability to stop proliferation, it can become cancerous  My research focuses on the stability of E protein  E proteins are factors that play an important role in cell division and differentiation  To investigate E protein stability, a region of the protein was altered to create an area of negative charge, which mimics phosphorylation  The effect of the mutation was tested in proliferating and differentiating cells  Using immunofluorescent microscopy, 1 saw that the phosphorylated-like mutant E protein prevents differentiation  This result suggests that protein stability and phosphorylation are related to the role of E protein in cell cycle regulation.

Luis Bufiuel and Pedro Almodovar are among the most controversial Spanish movie directors of their generations  Fifty years stand between each director's first movie, Un chien andalou (1928) and Pepi, Luci, Bom, y otras chicas del mont6n (1978); yet, they share a quest in the search for liberty and new aesthetic and intellectual frontiers  Bufiuel made his films in the first two decades of the twentieth century, while Almodovar has created his in the last two decades of the last millennium  Due to the character and thematic content of their films, it is inevitable to compare these prolific directors  Both are independent filmmakers, whose creations remain outside of the mainstream and noncommercial  Despite their marginalization, they have obtained worldwide recognition and success  Each has won numerous film awards, including Oscars for Best Foreign Film.

Contemporary Hong Kong Art and Cultural Identity" is deceiving in that none of the terms constituting this title asserts an explicit definition  Although Hong Kong cultural identity has often been commodified in the form of the clich "East meets West," a multitude of interpretations exist  The term "Hong Kong" can simply be thought of as the name of a place, yet the associations and images of this place vary so greatly that there is no one prevailing interpretation on which one can depend  A center of cultural exchange or a cultural desert? Although the contradictions do not point towards a simple representation, they do indicate the ideological pluralism that exists in this community  Looking at contemporary Hong Kong artists and their work, this presentation will shed light on various reactions to this controversy, particularly in reference to the 1997 handover during which cultural identity was most critically questioned and diversely represented.

This year, an advanced infrared "optical tweezers" setup was constructed and characterized at Wellesley  Optical tweezers have many useful applications, ranging from constructing very small "nanostructures" to studying biological systems  Our setup will be used to study physical properties of biological interactions  These devices work on a much smaller scale than do conventional tweezers, and use lasers to "grab" small objects  Once trapped, the objects can be held for observation, moved or collided with other trapped objects without damaging or contaminating samples  In order to study physical interactions quantitatively, one must first have a good calibration of the trapping force  Our optical tweezers have computer-controlled manipulation of the sample position which allows us to calibrate the horizontal trapping forces using the known fluid drag forces  Vertical trapping forces will be measured by varying the power of the laser.

Optical tweezers are tools for nonintrusive manipulation of micrometer-sized particles  They are constructed by coupling a laser beam into a microscope objective which focuses the light to a small waist where objects can be trapped  Laser scalpels are used to ablate, fuse or cut biological objects using tightly-focused laser light  While conducting research in the laser cooling and trapping group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, I worked on the construction and calibration of a laser trapping/ablation system consisting of optical tweezers and a laser scalpel  This versatile device allowed us to study biological interactions of the microscopic level  Polystyrene spheres and liposomes were trapped and manipulated within imprinted mirochannels to study their surface adhesion interactions with different plastic materials  The experimental studies with liposomes are precursors to further work in the field of biotechnology, in particular, the use of liposomes as drug delivery systems.

In recent years, new technology that uses lasers to cool a gas of neutral atoms has made giant leaps to bring us closer to absolute zero (the coldest temperature possible) than we've ever been before  This new technology, which allows us to cool atoms' orders of magnitude below room temperature, has opened doors for improving time and frequency standards that are of increasing importance for many applications ranging from communication and navigation to tests of fundamental science  I will discuss how laser cooling and trapping works and describe the apparatus I have constructed here at Wellesley.

Students walking through the main entrance to Clapp Library every day may not realize that they are passing the bronze doors made by Evelyn Beatrice Longman, a prominent early-twentieth-century American sculptor  Longman (1874-1954) was the first woman sculptor to become a full member of the National Academy of Design  In publications of her day, she was hailed as one of the most successful women sculptors and was compared favorably against the men with whom she competed for commissions  Despite her prominence during her lifetime, she has been virtually ignored in contemporary scholarly literature  Researching how Longman received commissions for large-scale public monuments reveals how she was able to establish a professional reputation in a male-dominated art world  Examining her work within its art historical context shows how the tension between modernism and traditionalism, as well as changing beliefs about the role of public sculpture, have affected how her work is remembered today.

The life-course implications of the personality characteristic of Emotional Instability were examined in a sample of 90 men and women studied from late adolescence through older age  Emotional Instability was defined in terms of a propensity to experience negative affect and have problems with impulse control  Because participants in this study were born in the 1920s and reached adolescence in the 1930s and 1940s, a time when gender expectations differed for men and women, Emotional Instability had different life-course implications for emotionally unstable boys and girls  A history of adolescent Emotional Instability for men manifested itself in lower economic attainment in older age  In contrast, emotionally unstable girls had problems with interpersonal relations and lower life satisfaction scores later in life  Comparisons of emotionally unstable individuals who decreased in emotional instability with age (improvers) with individuals who remained high in emotionally instability throughout their lives (nonchangers) will also be discussed.

Many research studies have examined the numerous structural, cultural and psychological barriers preventing Asian women from leaving an abusive relationship, but little research has investigated the coping mechanisms battered Asian women use  This exploratory study primarily focuses on the significant but silenced community of battered Korean immigrant women and hopes to shed some light on the coping strategies and resources that they employ during the course of domestic violence  Through focus groups of Korean women and interviews with service providers, I anticipate finding certain coping mechanisms: positivism, hope and culturally-accepted values such as fatalism and perseverance  I will address how Korean women stay emotionally and psychologically healthy while enduring violence, how their coping strategies may be culturally bound and how their strategies compare to those of battered Caucasian women.

Designing programs around the natural decomposition of a problem into modules makes it easier for programmers to write and maintain programs  This principle is known as modularity  Despite the benefits of modularity, it introduces inefficiency into programs, in part due to the creation of intermediate data structures such as lists and trees  Deforestation is a program transformation that eliminates some of these structures, allowing programmers to write modular programs with reckless abandon and still enjoy the efficiency benefits of monolithic programming  Most existing deforestation algorithms require the input program to be in a restricted form in order to ensure that deforestation occurs  Olaf Chitil has recently developed a type-inference-based algorithm for deforestation, which removes some of these restrictions  Chitil has also developed a prototype that partially implements this algorithm  This prototype requires more development in order to test it on example programs  This year I am working on developing the tools necessary to test the prototype, with the goal of fully implementing Chitil's algorithm  My work will lead to a stronger basis for comparison between different deforestation techniques, and to a better understanding of how deforestation works in practice.

The enzyme EC 3 4 24 15 is activated by thiol reagents  There are 14 cysteines in the protein, three of which are thought to be located near the active site  Disulfide bridges involving these three cysteines are believed to block substrate access to the active site  In the presence of thiol reagents, an increase in enzyme activity is observed  A triple mutant, in which the three active site cysteines have been replaced by serines, is 20 times more active than the wildtype  However, we have found that other, possibly surface, cysteine residues are responsible for aggregation and precipitation of the protein  Exhaustive alkylation of the surface cysteines produces wildtype and mutant enzymes ten-fold more active than the unmodified wild-type protein  However, the activity is still lower than that of the unmodified mutant  This implies that optimal activity occurs when the three cysteines near the active site are reduced, while other cysteines are not.

Adenosine is a signaling molecule that is elevated in the lungs of asthmatics and has been implicated to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease  Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is a purine catabolic enzyme that controls adenosine levels  Consequently, ADA-deficient mice develop severe asthma in association with elevated adenosine  Systemic ADA enzyme therapy can prevent severe asthma in this model by lowering adenosine levels  It is not known, however, whether this effect is a consequence of lowering local or systemic levels of adenosine  To address this, both injection and inhalation routes of ADA delivery were compared  It was shown that intranasally administered ADA lowered lung adenosine levels  Furthermore, the intranasally administered ADA remained localized to the lung  This study suggests that inhalation of ADA will be sufficient to produce similar effects as seen with the injection of ADA, only with local effects.

The enzyme EC 3 4 24 15 (EP 24 15) binds and cleaves peptides of 20 amino acids or less  Possible endogenous substrates for the enzyme include bradykinin, gonadotropin releasing hormone and neurotensin  In the laboratory, activity of EP 24 15 is most easily monitored using quenched fluorescent substrates  Previous studies have shown that in the optimal pH range for the enzyme (from 7 0 to 8 0), hydrolysis of substrate is enhanced by the addition of manganese or calcium ions  In an effort to determine the nature of the interaction between the divalent metals, protein and/or substrate, we have determined kinetic parameters for the protein over a wide pH range with and without the addition of Mn(II) and Ca(II)  The metals both enhance binding and increase maximal velocity  These observations suggest that the effect of metal ions may be due in part to their substitution for protons involved in binding substrate.

Tuberculosis, once one of the most common and most feared diseases, disappeared from the consciousness of most Americans and Europeans after several potent antibiotics were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s  Recently, the emergence of virulent drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a sharp increase in the number of cases worldwide have led to the urgent need for the development of newer and more effective drugs  As part of our long-standing interests in the chemistry of organic hydrazines and the chemotherapy of tuberculosis, we have been investigating reliable and reproducible methods for the preparation of tuberculostatic derivatives of acid hydrazides on such a scale and in such purity as to be suitable for subsequent biological evaluation  We have now found that a variety of acid hydrazides react cleanly with diketones to produce acylamidopyrroles in good yields  The latter compounds represent an interesting and less common class of heterocycles, some of which are isomeric with the demonstrated tuberculostats isonicotinic acid hydrazide and pyrazinamide  Research has focused on the confirmation of product structures, the study of the synthetic reactions by examination of possible intermediates and the evaluation of chemical properties key to tuberculostatic action.

Previous studies have shown that there is a definite increase of finger temperature at night in both men and women and that this rise in temperature is necessary to fall asleep  This is in contrast to changes in core body temperature, which decreases during sleep  In our study, we are addressing questions related to whether sex hormones secreted during the menstrual cycle alter blood flow in the hands and feet, either at night or during the day  In our initial studies we compared vasodilatation in the fingers during periods of sleep and nonsleep in both male and female subjects  Not only does the temperature of the hands increase during sleep, but there are pulses of vasodilatation seen in both male and female subjects  During sleep, these pulses are greater and of longer duration  In contrast, during wakefulness, the pulses are of shorter duration, of smaller magnitude and more frequent  Our next question was to determine whether the pattern of vasodilatation during sleep and wakefulness varied over the menstrual cycle  We measured core body temperature to indicate the phase of the menstrual cycle along with finger temperature in five female subjects as well as in three control male subjects  There does seem to be a difference in finger temperature in females during the daytime at different phases of the menstrual cycle.

The photosynthetic apparatus in plants needs to maintain the delicate balance between maximizing the harvesting of light energy to sustain life processes, and minimizing the amount of reactive oxygen species generated by excess energy at the thylakoid membrane in an oxygen-rich environment  As plants encounter excess light, it triggers a cascade of events at the thylakoid membrane, such as oxidative damage, photoprotection and repair  Much research has been done identifying and analyzing the mechanisms in response to oxidative stress  However, most studies have focused on a few proteins, while very little is known about the magnitude of the global protein changes at a given time point  The focus of my thesis research is to take a "snapshot" of the protein changes induced by oxidative stress by looking at the thylakoid membrane proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Yarrowia lipolytica is a dimorphic yeast that replicates by budding or by forming hyphae  Hyphal formation is a characteristic that is typically found in pathogenic yeasts such as Candida albicans  In order to isolate mutations in genes involved in hyphal formation for further study, we are adapting the method of restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REM!)  This method uses restriction enzymes to insert linearized plasmids into the chromosomal DNA at restriction sites, creating tagged mutations  REM! has previously been successful in other yeasts but has not been tried in Y  lipolytica  A variety of plasmids were transformed into Yarrowia strain El22 in the presence of the BamHI enzyme to stimulate restriction enzymemediated integration  Both lithium-acetate and electroporation were used to transform El22  Preliminary results show some stimulation in transformation when BamHI is present, suggesting that restriction enzyme-mediated integration events have occurred.

Yarrowia lipolytica, a dimorphic yeast discovered to be an opportunistic pathogen, is a distant relative of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, another dimorphic yeast  Dimorphism, the ability to grow in either the yeast form or in filamentous form, is correlated with the ability to cause infection  To study the genes involved in the regulation of filamentous growth, a mutant was isolated using ultra-violet light  The recessive mutant YNFl is temperature sensitive and unable to form filaments at 30C, but can at room temperature  The mutant was also tested for filamentous growth on several different media  No hyphae were seen on plates containing fatty acid and glucose  On media supplemented with bovine calf serum or N-acetylglucosamine, filaments were only seen at room temperature not at 30C.

The "Brain Drain" was coined to describe the mass migration of African professionals from their native countries to the West over the past few decades  My previous study was about doctors who are reversing this trend  This study instead focuses on African health care professionals who have chosen to remain in their host countries  Is there awareness among these professionals that their absence contributes to the Brain Drain? Are their reasons for remaining purely financial, or are they more complex? Are there similarities in the stories they tell, which could help us better understand this sociological phenomenon? "Choices in the Brain Drain" is about these doctors, their lives and the compromises with which they live  It is about the difficult choices they make and continue to make as they live the realities of an African health care professional in the developed world.

Education in South Asia faces many challenges  In an attempt to change this predicament, many not-for-profit groups have mushroomed, including one of the most noticeable in Pakistan: religious institutions, or madaris  Madaris are often started by religious scholars in an attempt to educate children in religious knowledge  Among many scholars, as well as in the Western media, madaris are considered backward institutions that harm, rather than benefit, society  However, on close examination, one finds that this assessment is both inadequate and imprecise  This presentation will analyze the impact of these madaris on education in Pakistan, and whether they are, or can be, successful in addressing educational needs  In addition, the new interest of the government in these schools will be addressed, highlighting the changing role of religion and religious organizations in the politics of Pakistan.

There are few photographs that are more intensely personal than the self-portrait  My self-portraits are an expression of an instantaneous moment in time: a raised eyebrow, a pleading gaze  I use them to change the way I look at myself and the way I present myself to others  They are a way for me to reassemble myself, piece by piece, shot by shot  By pushing myself, both as an artist and as my own subject, I hope to stretch the boundaries of what one expects from a self-portrait  This grid of images emphasizes the puzzle-like aspect of my work - the reassembling, the recreation, the redefining of self  This is my attempt to capture these pieces of time, these scraps of emotion, on film.

With an interest in the vital role of architecture, landscape and place creation in shaping the life and character of a neighborhood, and in forming individual and cultural identity, this paper considers the impact of two urban projects that integrate art, architecture and community revitalization  Project Row Houses in Houston and the casitas of New York City are different attempts at physical and social change in an urban environment  They offer important lessons for architects, planners and politicians who seek to affect change in some of the most depressed communities in the United States  Project Row Houses, the result of the vision of artist Rick Lowe, is a series of 22 shotgun houses that have been renovated and put to new use in Houston's Third Ward, a predominately African American, low-income community  Dilapidated and essentially abandoned when he first saw them, the houses have been transformed, through volunteer efforts and private donations, into installation art spaces, houses for young single mothers and classrooms for children  Building on the vision of the African American community portrayed in the work of painter John Biggers, Lowe's combination of art, housing and enrichment programming for local children is unique and successful  The casitas of New York are small, wooden, brightly painted houses that function as community centers in the Lower East Side, East Harlem, the South Bronx and Brooklyn  They closely resemble domestic vernacular architecture of Puerto Rico and have been built by Puerto Rican immigrants  They are usually accompanied by a garden and are on lots owned by the city but that have been functionally abandoned and left to go to waste  Each casita is different, but all are maintained by the casita members who come from the neighborhood, and in some cases distant neighborhoods, to use them  Many casitas and gardens have been Jost to development and many more are threatened as real estate values, particularly in the Lower East Side, escalate  This paper examines the lessons of Project Row Houses and the casitas from an architectural and urban planning standpoint  Among the issues considered are the link between place and cultural identity, the importance of nature in an urban setting, the role of art in people's lives and the need for diversity in an urban landscape  The project includes information gained from site visits and interviews in Houston and throughout New York, as well as readings in the architectural history of the pertinent forms, urban theory and planning and environmental psychology.

Several researchers have studied ethnicity as an explanation of why students perform differently in schools and on standardized tests  The goal of my project was to determine whether the different family cultures children grow up with, have a direct effect on how they view academics and how they perform in school  To study this, l interviewed fifth-grade students from different schools throughout El Paso, Texas  Approximately 80 students identified as either Hispanic or white participated in the 10-1 S minute interviews  Worth noting are the children's responses regarding support, expectations and positive and negative role models  There were no clear distinctions between how children from each ethnic group responded  My project explains how I came to see the importance of looking at the whole child and how this can change the way we look at education.

Charter schools sponsored by private businesses, teachers or parents play a major role in the reform of public education  Since 1991 over 1400 of these schools have opened in the United States  Not only must charter school advocates convince states to pass charter school laws, but they must also convince states to pass "strong" laws that encourage the expansion of the charter school movement  Quantitative research demonstrates that the factors influencing the passage of charter school legislation differ significantly from the factors influencing the strength of the law that is passed  Quantitative research also demonstrates that multiple political and demographic variables influence boU1 the passage and strength of charter school legislation  Qualitative research, in the form of interviews of legislators and education activists, confirms these conclusions  These results have important implications for the success of the Charter School Movement.

Air pollution," says Indonesian environmental activist Ahmad Safrudin, "is a poor man's issue " Air pollution disproportionately affects the poor through increased exposure to pollution and greater inability to pay the resulting health care costs  Looking at two case studies, Hong Kong, China, and Riau, Indonesia, this study examines the nexus between class and the environment in an Asian context  To what degree is air pollution a class issue? How does social class affect the way air pollution is perceived and addressed by society and government? And as air quality worsens in Asia, already home to five of the world's seven most polluted cities, what are the implications for class relations?.

Mary M  Allen, Biological Sciences Previous work in our laboratory suggested that there was a correlation between the concentration of cyanophycin and the integrated ratios of specific peaks in its proton ('H) NMR spectrum  The purpose of our investigation was to verify this correlation, demonstrate its reproducibility and apply this methodology to analyze the cyanophycin content of cyanobacteria  'H NMR spectra of serial dilutions of cyanophycin in 0 1 N HCl verified the proposed correlation and demonstrated its reproducibility  The cyanophycin content of wild-type and mutant forms of the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp  Strain PCC 6803 provided by Dr  L  Sherman of Purdue University was determined using this correlation  Only the wild-type 6803 cells grown with chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of protein synthesis on ribosomes, showed a significant presence of cyanophycin.

Mary M  Allen, Biological Sciences To study the metabolism of the cyanobacterial nitrogen storage molecule cyanophycin granule polypeptide (CGP), nitrogen starvation was induced in the species Synechocystis sp  Strain PCC 6308  During the starvation period, CGP degradation was expected  "NH Cl (2 mM) and TES buffer (4 mM) were then added to the growth medium  The cells were sampled at fixed time intervals after nitrogen readdition and subjected to a variety of tests  Initial results show that dry weights of the cells stayed relatively constant over the 24-hour time period after nitrogen readdition  CGP was extracted from the cells with 0 1 N HCl after each time interval and subjected to 'H NMR spectroscopy  A high "N:, N ratio was seen in the spectra of cells from the later time periods  This suggests that ammonium-derived nitrogen from the medium, not from degraded cellular proteins, was preferentially incorporated into CGP at these times.

Mary M  Allen, Biological Sciences Cyanophycin is a nitrogen reserve material that accumulates during environmentally stressful conditions in cyanobacteria  The synthesis and degradation of cyanophycin are under study in our laboratory using experiments in which cells are grown under different culture conditions and cyanophycin is analyzed by 'H NMR spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis  Cells were treated with chloramphenicol alone or with low light and chloramphenicol, and cyanophycin was isolated at different times after treatment  NMR spectroscopy showed an immediate increase in the amount of cyanophycin; the nitrogen in cyanophycin originated both from the medium and cellular protein breakdown  Cells repleted with "N-nitrate in the presence of chloramphenicol in high light showed cyanophycin with 50% "N in 2 5 hours, while cells with "N-nitrate and chloramphenicol in low light showed 50% "N by 15 hours  SOS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibody raised to purified cyanophycin showed an increase in cyanophycin molecular weight after cells were treated with chloramphenicol and low light  These experiments suggest that not only do the granules increase in size, but also the molecular weight of the polymer increases with time after chloramphenicol treatment.

Mary M  Allen, Biological Sciences We have been studying proteases induced in cyanobacteria in response to nitrogen starvation and other stresses  Specifically, we have been examining the relationship between proteases produced following nitrogen starvation and refeeding, and proteins involved in the synthesis and degradation of the nitrogen-storage molecule cyanophycin  The cyanobacteria studied included strain 6803 and two mutants, each of which is missing a protein: One of these lacks the protease to break down cyanophycin, while the other lacks the synthetase to make cyanophycin  Each of the three strains was starved for nitrogen for several days and refed with nitrate  The cells were allowed to grow for varying amounts of time and then harvested  In another series of experiments, proteases were induced by stress with high salt  The proteins induced by this process in each strain were then analyzed with casein zymogram gels and NMR techniques.

Mary M  Allen, Biological Sciences The goal of these experiments is to study how the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp  Strain PCC 6308, which grows optimally at -pH 8, responds to acidic pH stress  Acid tolerance of this organism has been shown to involve changes in protein expression, pigmentation, internal as well as external pH and the formation of as yet unidentified intracellular granules  The lower pH limit for growth of this bacterium is -pH 4 4, and growth experiments as well as fluorescence microscopy using Sitix Green dye (Molecular Probes) were used to investigate cell viability.

Mary M  Allen, Biological Sciences Our research focused on finding the optimal growth medium for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6308  In our laboratory, cyanobacteria have typically been fed nitrate as its nitrogen source; however, we wanted to determine if this strain would grow better if ammonium chloride was provided instead  We hypothesized that the cyanobacteria would grow better with this nitrogen source, because it is known that ammonium enters most cells and is directly utilized, whereas when cells are fed nitrate, it must be converted into nitrite, and then ammonium, before it is utilized  The amount of growth and pH of the medium were monitored; growth curves and growth yields were plotted  The buffer TES was used because ammonium chloride is acidic; experiments were also carried out to determine the buffering capacity of TES  Results indicate that TES is not a good buffer under our conditions and that the optimal ammonium concentration is 4 mM.

These experiments deal with the purification of a protease (an enzyme that degrades proteins) with a molecular weight of 62 kD, from cells of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp  Strain PCC 6308  Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic organisms belonging to the eubacteria group, which carry out photosynthesis  Our laboratories have shown that a number of physiological and biochemical changes occur in cyanobacteria that have been nitrogen starved and re-fed with a form of nitrogen such as nitrate  Cells were grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions, then re-fed with nitrogen for one hour  Previous experiments have shown that a 62kD protease is induced in cells under these conditions  Purification methods include the use of ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sepharose column purification and gel electrophoresis  Purification steps are followed using casein zymogram gels.

Today, students are bombarded with an astonishing amount of information from all sides  E-mail and the Internet have made it virtually painless for anyone to share or gather information  Unfortunately, not all Web sites are created equal, and not all information is trustworthy  Without a formal certification process, the Internet is overrun with half-truths, propaganda and out-right lies  Though there are certainly reliable and authentic Web sites, it is very difficult to distinguish the good from the bad  As students now rely more on the Internet for research and information, without careful training they are becoming more susceptible to these traps  To better grasp the scope of this situation we will examine how students respond to various forms of "information" on the Internet, such as political propaganda, medical scams and advertising ploys  How do students determine the reliability and accuracy of information provided by Web sites? Do students readily believe Microsoft? The United States government? How often do students double-check information cited in a Web site? Two hundred students of varying backgrounds and abilities were surveyed to help develop a better understanding of students' abilities to critically evaluate information found on the Internet.

AtABPl was recently discovered and isolated in this laboratory, and found to contain a region of homology to the yeast protein Secl4p  Secl4p transfers phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylcholine between membranes and is essential for Golgi-associated protein secretion  We hypothesized that AtABPl also binds phospholipids  AtABPl was expressed and purified from E coli and an assay using phospholipid vesicles was developed to characterize its binding activity  Binding to a range of Pl mono-, bi- and tri-phosphate derivatives was also tested using a "fat blot" assay  AtABPl was found to bind most strongly to PI-3-P and Pl-5-P, with some binding to other PI derivatives  Since Pl-3-P is required for the formation of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles and AtABPl is located at the cell plate, AtABPl may link the actin cytoskeleton to the Golgi and play an important role in the vesicle trafficking required for cell division.

In order to understand identity and how it is constituted, it is necessary to analyze the multiple factors that shape an individual's self-identity  This paper is an analysis of multiculturalism as a discourse and how the institutional structures and modes of subjectivity that this discourse creates influence individual self-identity  Drawing on ethnographic research and interviews with Mexican-descent students at Wellesley College, this paper explores how campus-wide discourses of multiculturalism constitute students' experiences of self by defining the categories of difference through which self-identity becomes articulated  I argue that multiculturalism, as understood by most Wellesley students, establishes categories of difference founded on racial and ethnic variables that force students to identify themselves with one of these categories  My goal is to challenge people to consider the assumptions that underlie popular understandings of multiculturalism and to analyze the effects of this discourse in practice.

Following the Zapatista Uprising of 1994 in Chiapas, Mexico, the issue of indigenous rights rose to the forefront of Mexican politics  The complex debate surrounding this issue reflects the difficulty of incorporating minority groups into modern liberal democracies  The basic principles of liberal democracy emphasize individuality and a sovereign, limited territory  In contrast, indigenous groups reject the supremacy of the individual by seeking group-specific rights  They also challenge the myth that autonomous regions will lead to national fragmentation.

and Sally Sanford, Music The Wellesley College Collegium Musicum's recent production of Henry Purcell's Dido and Aeneas introduced its audiences to performance archaisms such as Restoration English pronunciation and seventeenth-century vocal production, staging, gesture, and dance  Productions like this one raise an important question: do "historically accurate" performances enable modern audiences to more fully understand historical material, or do they alienate them from it? Performance, social conventions, and behavioral standards in Restoration England are different enough from those in modern American culture to make them seem foreign and abstract  In order to promote a modern understanding of that historical culture, audience members will be invited to participate in exercises that will introduce them to the Restoration world  After this familiarization process, the Dido and Aeneas cast will present scenes from the opera in order to demonstrate that committed, impassioned performances enable meaning to transcend temporal boundaries.

We have studied the low-energy electron induced reactions of dichlorodifluoromethane (CF2Cl2), commonly known as CFC-12, because of a newly proposed hypothesis l for the formation of the ozone hole  Our experimental procedure involves low-energy (10 - 250 eV) electron irradiation of nanoscale thin films (~ 10A thickness) of CF2c12 grown at 100 K on a molybdenum single crystal in a ultrahigh vacuum chamber (p ~ 1 x 10-10 Torr)  Post-irradiation temperature programmed desorption experiments were used to identify C2F4C12, C2F3Cl3, C2F2Cl4, C2F3CI, and C2F2Cl2 as radiolysis products of CF2Cl2  The radiolysis product yield as a function of electron energy, electron fluence, and film thickness was investigated to probe the electron-induced reaction mechanism (s).

The goal of this study was to characterize the acid stress response in Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803 and to compare cultures in the exponential and stationary phases of growth  Growth studies indicated that log-phase cultures of Synechocystis are incapable of growth in environments with a pH less than 6  Cells stressed at pH values greater than 6 had similar growth rates to nonacid stressed cells  However, acid stressed cultures had a lower viability than nonstressed cells  Gel electrophoresis and autoradiography suggested that several proteins were differentially synthesized in response to acid stress: the synthesis of phycocyanin was down-regulated while the synthesis of at least two proteins, 20kDa and lOkDa, was up-regulated  To compare nonstressed exponential and stationary phase cells, the OD750 and the concentration of cells in each culture were measured  Results from these measurements suggested that stationary phase cells are larger than exponentially growing cells.

Why do some colleges and universities have more developed recycling programs than others? There are many factors that influence the creation of a successful recycling program, and many more that affect how the program is maintained on campus  Suburban campuses tend to have lower rates of recycling than rural or urban schools, and women's colleges are least likely to have an effective recycling program, if one exists at all  The presence of an Environmental Studies major is a far more powerful determining factor than a large endowment  What does this mean for Wellesley? There is much to overcome in order to initiate a sustainable program, but we can learn much from the successes and failures of our peer institutions.

Chromium and lead are toxic to organisms even in small amounts  The former Henry Wood 's Sons Paint Factory used heavy metals as paint pigments and contaminated  the area surrounding Paintshop Pond in Wellesley  Bacteria were isolated from soil samples  Isolates were stained and analyzed by light and electron microscopy   Bacteria were found to survive on chromate concentrations up to 9 0mM and on lead concentrations of u p to 1mM   Many of the isolates were found to survive in both anaerobic and aerobic conditions  Gram stains showed both Gram positive and negative bacteria, and both cocci and rods were present  Electron microscopy showed the presence of pili and capsules  No plasmids appear to be present  Anti biotic tests suggested that heavy metal resistance may not necessarily confer antibiotic resistance  Atomic absorbance spectrometry indicated chromate was present in trace amounts in the bacteria.

Cyanobacteria are ancient organisms, able to survive under many stressful conditions, including nitrogen deficiency  They accumulate nitrogen in the storage polymers  phycocyanin  and  cyanophycin  To understand the mechanism of nitrogen storage in  cyanobacteria  we have examined several steps in nitrogen metabolism  Two strains of cyanobacteria were grown after nitrogen stress to identify at what point phycocyanin, a molecule involved in light harvesting, is synthesized  These strains were also regrown in lSN after nitrogen stress so that NMR spectroscopy could be used to determine whether the phycocyanin is made wit h nitrogen from within the cell or from the external medium  Utilization of some nitrogen sources requires the conversion of nitrate to ammonium  To determine at which point this pathway is activated , the activity of the enzyme nitrate reductase was measured after cells were grown under nitrogen starvation conditions and refed.

The use of gel electrophoresis and autoradiography determined  the proteins that are synthesized by Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803 at alkaline conditions  Various breakage techniques separated the proteins from the soluble fractions  The FOCUS technique had the best ability to separate whole cell protein , which were mostly low molecular proteins  Previous studies have shown that when cells of 6803 are transferred to pH 4, they survive and the pH of the unbuffered medium shows an immediate rise above pH 6  It was hypothesized that cells may be excreting a substance that causes a rise in pH  Colorimetric ammonium assays performed on the medium of acid stressed cells showed an increase in ammonium concentration over time  Organisms that possess an ATR are able, after a mild or moderate pH shock, to survive extreme pHs  Results of ATR experiments suggest that 6803 lacks this survival mechanism.

The Internet is becoming an increasingly important forum for political campaigning; it provides candidates with a new, low cost way to communicate with the public and mobilize possible supporters  This research  examines t he campaign Web sites of t he candidates who ran for Congress in 2002 and had a presence on the World Wide Web  The home page of each site was examined for its general tone, electronic features, voter information, and images  Data are combined with information on the candidate's previous political experience, campaign funding, and potential constituency  Findings from the content analysis indicate that having a Web site is influenced by the candidate's party affiliation, gender, political experience, financial resources , electoral competitiveness, and constituency education level  A candidate's gender and political experience also influence the specific electronic features chosen for the site's home page  This research is important because of its implications for whether the Internet will succeed in "leveling the playing field " for all candidates, and whether it will serve to increase voter awareness and participation.

The eukaryotic cell cycle oversees the growth and division of cells through protein-protein interactions  Specifically, the interactions between cyclins and cyclin-dependant kinases (Cdks) serve to localize an active kinase to substrates in different regions of the cell  An example of this differential localization is being explored in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Dividing yeast possess a unique structure at the mother bud neck: a septin ring  This ring forms an hour glass shape just beneath the cytoplasm, and serves as a scaffold for proteins important for bud morphogenesis and cytokinesis  One protein known to localize to the septin ring is Clb2, the primary mitotic cyclin  Clb2 is recruited to the bud neck by the Bud3 protein  During G2 and M phase of the cell cycle, Clb2 binds to and activates the yeast Cdk, Cdc28  The existence of direct biochemical interactions between Bud3-Cdc28 or Clb2- Cdc28-Bud3 are currently being explored  Relaxing, Shifting, and Folding: Senior Research in the Chemistry Department (panel) Conformational Effects of Strengthened Hydrogen Bonding in a Thioxo Beta Hairpin Erzsi M  Szilagyi '04, Chemistry ADVI SOR: Julia H  Miwa, Chemistry Protein misfolding has been recognized as a source of diseases such as Alzheimer's  I n order to develop potential therapeutics, it is necessary to understand the source of protein misfolding  The approach utilized here is to strengthen the backbone hydro gen bonding of a 12-residue peptide known to assume a -hairpin structure by replacing one of the amide bonds with a thioamide bond  The amino acids in the  hairpin sequence H2N-Arg-Tyr-Val-Glu Val-dPro-Gly-Orn-Lys-lle-Leu-tjJCS-NHGl n-NH2 were coupled using standard solid phase peptide synthesis  The thioamide bond was incorporated into the sequence by replacing the amide oxygen in Fmoc Leu with a sulfur and forming a nitrobenzotriazole leaving group on the C-terminus  Mass spectrometry has confirmed the successful synthesis of the thiopeptide, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies will be used to investigate the conformational effects of strengthened hydrogen bonding on the  hairpin.

The nucleoside adenosine is involved in a range of biological functions , from nucleoside biosynthesis  to viral mRNA-capping  By creating an analogue of adenosine, the enzymes involved in these functions can be inhibited , resulting in antiviral and anticancer activity  In order to create desired adenosine analogues, nucleophilic addition of either a nitrogen or a cyano group onto C-3 of 3-bromo-4-substituted- 1,2,4-triazole  (1)  was necessary  Generation of a triazolium intermediate (via oxidation or alkylation of a nitrogen adjacent to the halide) gives easy displacement of the halide, but difficult conversion to the desired products  Direct nucleophilic  aromatic  substitution  onto the triazole using KCN in DMF, gives 3-cyano- 4-phenyl - 1,2,4-triazole (2), but in very low yield   Use of CuCN, on the other hand, gives a much more efficient displacement, most likely due to complexation of the copper to the adjacent nitrogen   Reduction can then be performed by catalytic hydrogenation  The synthesis of 2 as well as further reactions of this compound will be discussed.

Thimet Oligopeptidase, EC 3 4 24 15 (TOP) is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that is distributed throughout the body  This enzyme has a variety of substrates including the blood pressure regulator, bradykinin  Since it is able to accommodate a large number of substrates, TOP is thought to have a flexible active site  We have used the denaturant, urea, to study the flexibility of the active site in binding different substrates  The activity and stability of TOP monomers, dimers, and multimers were examined  The substrates used were a fluorogenic version of bradykinin and a smaller fluorogenic substrate  It was shown in these  studies that the enzyme in dimeric and multimeric conformation  denatures  with  increasing urea concentrations but loses activity at different rates for the different substrates   By comparing the activity of the enzyme forms using both substrates , we were able to conclude that TOP flexibility , as modeled by unfolding in urea, allows binding of a variety of substrates.

Not even in the domain of the Tsar is personal liberty outraged to the extent it is in America, the stronghold of the Puritanic eunuchs," wrote the Anarchist Emma Goldman in 1909  Goldman came to the United States from Russia in 1885, when she was 16 years old  By the age of 20, she was living in a New York City commune with would-be assassin Alexander Berkman and lecturing on the overthrow of the government in front of hundreds of people  The Russian influences on Goldman's anarchism, as well as her vision of America as an inherently anarchist nation that had been duped by democracy, influenced her career, from her part in the attempted assassination of Henry Clay Frick and imprisonment for inciting riot, to blindly supporting the Bolsheviks and conspiring against the draft   Goldman 's anarchism and propaganda were rooted in Russian revolutionary ideals, and she attempted, usually without success, to use her faith in and love of Russia in spreading anarchy to the "poor, stupid, free American citizen!" until her deportation in 1919.

In the 1950s and '60s, Yoko Ono created a series of conceptual art projects consisting of brief , poem-like instructions  Presented in the form of written scores with or without accompanying manipulable objects, these instructions are open-ended and ambiguous in meaning  The Instruction Paintings reinterpreted the dynamic, transformative meanings of Marcel Duchamp 's readymades, John Cage's experimental scores, and Ono's understandings of Zen Buddhist traditions  The Instruction Paintings direct viewers to interact with the world around them in unexpected ways, creating a space for reflection that questions the distinctions among philosophy , art, and life  Despite the simplicity of the instructions, interacting with Ono's work can be a startling and liberating experience  Spectators will be offered the chance to perform some of these works in order to explore their participatory, yet ultimately introspective nature, and to examine Ono's contributions to Conceptual Art    supported by a Schiff Fellowship ) Studies of the Ancient World (paper session) De Suo: The Mosaics of the Piazzale delle Corporazioni and Their Social Implications Katie Alcauskas '04, Classical Studies and Art History ADVI SOR : Brendon Reay, Classical Studies and Miranda Marvin, Art The Piazzale delle Corporazioni of Ostia was a testament to Rome's wealth and international influence   This portico and the surrounding area were not only a practical space for trade groups and merchants to conduct business, but also a venue for exhibiting their prosperity and pride  The portico was split into small cubicles, in front of which black and white mosaics advertised various commercial ventures in every corner of the Empire  My investigation of the site generally reveals the importance of Ostia as an international commercial gateway for Rome  More specifically, my reading of the mosaics exposes their role in the presentation of "Romanness " for both provincials and for wealthy citizens (often former slaves) who populated this unique town.

How does a society remember war? What stories are remembered and what stories are silenced in the process of collective remembering? This thesis project explores the relationship of memory , silence, and war in the work of Medoruma Shun, a contemporary Okinawa n writer  Born a generation after the Battle of Okinawa, one of the bloodiest battles of World War II, Medoruma uses fiction not only to remember, but to examine the trauma of war and its aftermath  I have focused on his short story, The Butterfly Tree, about a young man who uncovers the story of a former "comfort woman " living on the edge of his village  By centering this war story on a woman who had been ostracized from the community both during and after the war, Medoruma demands that collective memory necessarily include those voices from the very edge of the margins.

With the growth of the Internet and the ease wit h which Web sites can be created, a lot of Web pages of questionable quality have appeared, making it a significant problem to search the Web for trustworthy information   In addition, more and more Internet users rely on and trust information  they receive from the Internet  I n addition, most people doing a Web search only look at the first page of results returned by the search engine  As a result, for a lot of commercial sites, it is important to appear as one of the first ten search results, and "spam" pages containing advertisement,  propaganda  material, or "infomercials " try to rank higher  The goal of my research is to implement an algorithm that will be used in a system that will prevent spam pages from qualifying high in the results returned by Web search engines  I have focused my attention on studying how using the concept of communities (collections of related inter connected pages) on the Web can improve the ranking of Web search results  The aim of the algorithm was to detect tight communities of related pages and then calculate the trustworthiness of each page in relation to the ranks of the rest of the Web pages in the community.

Aceh, a peninsula on the northern tip of Sumatra, signifies the diversity and disunity of Indonesia   Acehnese separatists and the Indonesian military have been engaged in violent conflict for decades, while civilians have been subject to gross human rights violations   Contrary to popular beliefs about gender and Islam, the Acehnese are known for their powerful women   Historically , this Muslim province was ruled by a succession of women, including one who appears on the Indonesian Rupiah as the national heroine for her resistance against Dutch colonization   Today, some women have joined the ranks of the armed separatist movement  In the domestic sphere, the Acehnese word for 'house wife' means 'owner of the house ' Exploring female political agency in Aceh within the larger context of Indonesian national politics will lead to a better understanding of the causes of the conflict and the role of Acehnese women in resolving it.

Although men and women worshipped together in early New England, the sexes experienced religion in strikingly different ways  Puritan men faced a profound and gendered identity crisis in which they were forced to come to terms with the intersection , and oftentimes collision , of their secular and religious selves  I used men's diaries, conversion narratives , poetry , and sermons as lenses through which to explore masculinity in Puritan New England at four critical life stages: marriage and the creation of a family, the conversion process leading to church membership , the call to an occupation , and facing death   Even though Puritan men were sure to confront strain in fulfilling their masculine roles in both the religious and secular spheres, these roles were not mutually exclusive  In most cases, men were able to develop effective coping mechanisms to manage their internal struggles with the matter of their masculinity.

The Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund in many states is in financial crisis  The economic recession of the late 90s exerted considerable strain on the solvency of the trust funds, depleting their resources   Some states' funds, including those from Minnesota, North Carolina, and Missouri , are on the verge of bankruptcy   Trust funds in New York and Texas have already reached bankruptcy  Why are these states in such financial distress? This presentation will shed light on some of the fundamental problems associated with unemployment insurance financing and reveal the effects of bankruptcy on workers' benefits and employers  tax rates  The Effect of Exchange Regulation on the Price Volatility and Trading Volume of Financial Derivatives Jennifer L  Schwalbenberg '04, Economics and Chinese Studies ADVI SOR: Eric D  Hilt, Economics and Ann D  Witte, Economics As more financial exchanges become publicly held companies, as opposed to privately held entities, it is important to understand the relationship between an changes in regulation, the price volatility and trading volume of the Nikkei future were compared to that of a comparable index future traded in the U  S , the S&P 500 future, during the same period.

Although much of the world 's attention over the past year has been focused on the US intervention in Iraq, there are over 50 other armed conflicts going on in the world today   Drawing on work done in International Relations 301, this panel will discuss four recent conflicts: the genocide in Rwanda , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the century-old sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland , and the recent decade of war and terror in Chechnya  Each of these conflicts offers important evidence about how wars start, why they can last so long, and how they affect the Jives of citizens caught in the cross-fire  The panel will place these four areas of conflict into the broader context of global insecurity and violence , and pose the question : what must be done to bring peace to our war torn world? Women 's Notions of Art and Beauty (paper session) Standards of Beauty in the African Diaspora: Latin America Loren Days '04, International Relations Aov1soR : Pashington Obeng, Africana Studies As a result of the mixing of races that occurred during the epoch of slavery in Latin America, the elites of Latin American colonies created hegemonic ideologies to perpetuate white power and privilege   Standards of beauty were embedded in a culture's values, beliefs , and ideologies, creating a system of power relations based on Caucasian physical features   This ideology continues to permeate throughout Latin American society today in standards of beauty  Join me as I discuss how women have internalized standards of beauty in connection to belonging to different social classes, ethnicities, professions, generations , or educational backgrounds.

Optical tweezers use a tightly focused laser beam to exert an extremely localized force on microscopic particles  These particles are pulled into the focus of the laser beam and "trapped"  I have modified the existing tweezers setup at Wellesley to form two optical traps which can be moved independently   This greatly expands the range of research that is possible with such a system   I am working to optimize the double trap system and calibrate it using polystyrene microspheres  As a particular application, I am studying the forces of adhesion between microspheres coated with Streptavidin and Biotin.

In our study of the aging phenomena in silica suspensions, we subjected several suspensions of silica particles in various silicone oils, mineral oil, and water to different shears and stresses, and measured their viscoelastic properties as a function of time  Samples based on silicone oil, initially of a pasty consistence, became fluid-like after a period of about three weeks  Aqueous samples aged much faster than these oily samples  After their respective aging period, all samples are nearly Newtonian and flow very well  Only samples containing mineral oil did not exhibit any changes in viscosity and elasticity  We will discuss a possible mechanism for these aging behaviors.

This study tested whether children aged three to five years would be more influenced by male and female puppets when the puppets communicated in a gender stereotyped manner (i e , male puppets using a masculine speaking style and female puppets using a feminine speaking style) than when the puppets communicated in a style associated with the other gender  In addition, the study assessed whether male puppets would be more influential when communicating about a masculine subject- the desirability of trains, baseballs, and other boys' toys and female puppets would be more influential when communicating about a feminine subject-the desirability of baby dolls, tea sets, and other girls' toys-than when the puppets expressed opinions about toys associated with the other gender  To test this, the children listened to male and female puppets expressing opinions that contradicted the children's own pretested opinions about a variety of different toys.

Program, Stone Center In recent years, many schools have implemented social-competency programs in the hopes of creating positive classroom environments  However, many programs are quickly discarded after initial enthusiasm wanes  In such a climate, how can good programs survive to successfully affect students? This presentation is based on a study that assessed features contributing to the sustained use of Open Circle, a social competency program based at the Stone Center  Factors were identified that appear to lead to ongoing use of such curriculum   These findings have implication s on larger questions of social change efforts in schools.

Approximately 40 million street children survive in Latin America  If they were all in one place, they would have their own country  Without strong governments, the responsibility of building stronger communities has increasingly fallen on the shoulders of socially responsible citizens and grassroots organizations  During the summer of 2004, Analuca Martnez helped organize a festival with Contexto Foundation that empowered children to voice their concerns about serious issues in El Pueblito, Guatemala  At Casa Alianza, Rosa Fernndez researched the role played by the United Nations, NGOs, and local governments in protecting childrens rights in Costa Rica  At Fundacin Paniamor (Costa Rica), Rebeca Tezaguic helped raise awareness about the Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children and Adolescents from commercial sexual exploitation  Finally, Celeste Owens worked advocating for the rights of working youth with Accin Callejera, an NGO responsible for shaping El Cdigo de la Niez in the Dominican Republic.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a 30 residue peptide involved in glucose-mediated insulin production  Exendin-4 (Ex-4), a 39 residue peptide found in Gila monster venom, was found to be an agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R)  Data from binding and activation assays of GLP-1 point mutants suggest that GLP-1 and Ex-4 have distinct and discrete receptor, activating regions and receptor-binding regions  We are examining the separability of these functions by truncating Ex-4 at the N-terminus and using a nonpeptide attachment to connect model small agonists to the binding region  The rst agonists studied use the natural N-terminal tripeptide molecule to show that we can preserve activation with such an attachment  Synthetic strategy and binding and activity data on the model compounds will be presented.

The N-terminal histidine of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and of exendin-4 have been shown to be critical for the activation of the pancreatic receptor (GLP-1R) which initiates insulin production  Previous amino acid substitutions of this histidine with lysine and with alanine have been interpreted to indicate the requirement for a positively charged residue in the N-terminal position  To further develop the structure-activity relationship for the interaction of the N-terminal amino acid of GLP-1 with GLP-1R, histidine analogs such as 1-imidazolyl-alanine (1), have been synthesized via Michael addition to an acrylic acid ester  Enantiomeric resolution was achieved enzymatically  The results of binding and activity studies for the incorporation of 1 and other such analogs into GLP-1 will be reported.

The protein polymer glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been shown to indirectly lower blood glucose levels in patients suffering from Type II diabetes  This effect is only observed when GLP-1 is bound to its receptor, GLP-1R  Understanding the molecular level interactions of GLP-1 and GLP-1R will allow for the targeted design of medicinal treatments for Type II diabetes  Synthesis of a histidine analog  a modied component of GLP-1 that acts as a probe  can elucidate specic interactions between GLP-1 and GLP-1R  Challenges and results of this synthesis will be discussed.

Studies have shown that peptide GLP-1 induces the production of insulin in the human body as it binds and activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), making it a promising method of treatment for diabetes mellitus  However, GLP-1 is short lived in vivo, thus it is necessary to nd binding, nonpeptide small molecule activators of GLP-1R  Although the non peptide antagonist T-0632 (1) inhibits the release of insulin, the selective binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R makes T-0632 a potential lead compound for diabetes treatment  We have developed an efcient synthesis of racemic T-0632  The resolution of T-0632 enantiomers has been attempted in two synthetic strategies via reaction with chiral alcohol to form diastereomers  Further details of the synthesis and chiral resolution will be discussed.

Our diets are full of natural amino acids, so one might question why we want to modify them  The fact is, nothing is wrong with the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, but unnatural amino acids have proven themselves to be extremely useful  When an amino acid is modied by thioxylation, in which the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a sulfur atom, the resulting peptide may show an increase in enzymatic stability and potency, which would be helpful in designing drugs  We are inserting a thiomide linkage into a beta-hairpin to gain an understanding of how the secondary structure surrounding the thiomide is affected  This information is essential in order for thioxylated amino acids to be useful as tools in protein design, and in the study of the relation-ship between structure and function in proteins and peptides.

During plant cytokinesis, the last phase of cellular division, membrane trafcking is central to the construction of the cell plate which separates the two daughter cells  Protein function is critical for vesicle trafcking to the developing cell plate  Patellin1 (PATL1) belongs to a family of Arabidopsis proteins characterized by a variable N-terminal domain followed by Sec14 and GOLD domains, which are commonly found in other membrane trafcking proteins  Previous research suggests that PATL1 is recruited to the expanding and maturing cell plate, where it is believed to serve a critical function  Approaches being taken to investigate protein interactions of two members of the patellin family, PATL1 and PATL2, include pull-down assays with clathrin and yeast two-hybrid screens  Phenotypes of PATL1 and PATL2 knockout mutants are being studied to determine if these proteins are required for normal cytokinesis and development.

The World Health Organization estimates that there are eight million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) per year, resulting in some two million deaths annually  Given the concurrent HIV epidemic, the situation with TB infection will only get worse in high incidence countries  There is a further complicating problem of Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) in many parts of the world  Improved therapy for both susceptible TB and MDRTB will require the development of new drugs for better treatment  We now report on new compounds that represent attractive leads for development as potential agents for therapy of MDRTB; for example, we have prepared new thioureas derived from meta-aminophenol  These compounds were prepared in good yields and purity, using methods of synthetic organic chemistry and will be tested for their activity against the causative agent of TB infection, Myobacterium tuberculosis.

This research is based on the relationship between antibiotic resistance and heavy metal resistance in bacteria  Not only are the genes that confer antibiotic resistance and heavy metal resistance often carried on the same plasmid but, the mechanisms which function in heavy metal resistance are comparable to those in antibiotic resistance  The main objective of this research is to investigate this relationship in bacterial strains isolated from Paint Shop Pond soils contaminated with high levels of lead and chromate for over one hundred years  Current work includes species identication of the isolates by DNA extraction and purication, PCR amplication of an approximately 1300 bp region of 16S rDNA and sequence analysis  Phylogenetic characterization of the isolated bacterial strains is underway  A future goal is to isolate and examine resistance conferring plasmids from several bacterial isolates.

In the late nineteenth century, Jane Addams became renowned for the establishment of Hull House in Chicago, an experiment in social reform, but she was not alone in the development of the Settlement House movement  On the East Coast, a group of college women was setting up its own houses in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston  Led by Vida Dutton Scudder, these female professors and students settled in slums in an attempt to close the ever-widening social class gap  In 1892, Scudder, with Emily Greene Balch, founded Denison House in Bostons South End  It was not their intention to become involved in reform politics initially, but after only a few months they could not avoid it  This talk looks at the development of Denison House into a center for female labor reform in Boston, and eventually, the movement of Scudder and Balch into the wider spectrum of reform causes.

It is estimated that 500,000 women and more than 200,000 children are trafcked each year through deception or kidnap-ping into sexual, domestic, and forced labor  Trafcking in humans has drawn more attention in the last few years as it has become a widespread and highly protable trade with few legal repercussions for the trafckers  Intricate webs of political, economic, and social conditions in many countries spur the supply of trafcked victims into demand countries  Organizations have been created to combat trafcking, but few studies have assessed the effectiveness of these programs  This presentation provides a brief overview of how and why trafcking in women and children occurs and describes some promising programs or methods to combat trafcking.

Cross-cultural psychology indicates that not all cultures construe the self similarly  In collectivistic cultures, there is a strong value placed on connectedness between the self and others, leading to an emphasis on group harmony with in-group members  On the other hand, individuals in individualistic societies consider the self to be autonomous in relation to others where establishing ones independence is strived for  In order to determine whether cultural values affect intracultural and intercultural negotiation processes, 42 cross-cultural empirical studies observing behavior were reviewed  Thirty-ve of these studies examined intracultural negotiations, whereas 10 studies examined intercultural negotiations  In most of the studies, behaviors were consistent and correlated with respective cultural values  Interestingly, unpredicted behaviors arose as well, indicating that culture cannot be the sole factor, especially in intercultural negotiation situations.

Over the past half century, the process of rapid urbanization, tightly linked to rural to urban migration, has signicantly affected the environment of cities around the world  Migrants have come and are still coming to the city, in hopes of a better life  Often they become inhabitants of disadvantaged neighborhoods, squatter settlements, and low-income areas  This winter I participated in the MIT-run SIGUS (Special Interest Group in Urban Settlement) workshop, which brought together a group of Architecture and Planning students from Boston and Lima, Peru, in order to analyze the social and physical development of four different low-income communities in Lima  We conducted family interviews in order to better understand important steps in the development of the settlements since 1968 when they were surveyed by then MIT professor John Turner  While placing the program in the context of my study abroad experiences, I will share some of our group as well as individual ndings.

Through a thesis in studio art I have been investigating disposable culture and the role it plays in our everyday lives  Using various photographic and printmaking formats, I am focusing on the path that our trash takes when we throw it away, as well as the commercial and consumer attitudes which reinforce its ongoing presence in our society  By identifying some of the recurring icons and materials that reect and shape our attitudes on disposability, I am discovering a few of the basic tenets underlying the culture of containerism  The images in the exhibit explore the duality of beauty and repulsion inherent in trash, as well as the iconic graphic nature of the containers.

Hydrogels are polymer networks that undergo stimuli-responsive volume phase transitions, in which the gels contract and expel their contents into their surroundings  Control of this behavior has prompted much research for use of hydro-gels as stimuli-responsive drug carriers  My research investigates two modications of gel thermoresponsive phase transition: the variation of gel composition and the addition of in situ gold nanoparticles  Gels were synthesized using thermosensitive N-isopropylacrylamide as the polymer backbone and using 0 00-3 50% wt  of N,N-methylenebisacry-lamide (MBAm) and/or N,N-cystaminebisacrylamide (CBAm) as crosslinking agents, and were then embedded with in situ gold nanoparticles  UV spectroscopy revealed that the phase transitions of in situ gold samples with high concentrations of CBAm widened the most  Mass and diameter measurements of in situ gold gels with high concentrations of CBAm and low concentrations of MBAm were also substantially larger than gels that had lower concentrations of CBAm and/or higher concentrations of MBAm.

Thermosensitive hydrogels are polymer networks that swell and deswell with temperature changes due to polymer-polymer and polymer-water interactions  Hydrogel copolymers of N-isopropylacry-lamide and acrylic acid, poly(NIPAm-co-AAc), were synthesized with varying concentrations of N,N-cystaminebisacry-lamide (CBAm) and N,N-methyl-enebisacrylamide (MBAm) as crosslinking agents  Gold nanostructures were synthesized within the poly (NIPAm-co-AAc) hydrogels  The phase transition temperatures and swelling properties of both the native and gold-containing poly(NIPAm-co-AAc) hydrogels were studied using mass measurements over a range of temperatures  The results of these studies are compared to those of gels without acrylic acid in the polymer backbone  Dried hydrogels were loaded with a uorescent-labeled model drug, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled dextran  TMR-dextran release proles for the NIPAm-coAAc hydrogels were studied using uorometry  The results of this research are applicable to the employment of thermoresponsive hydrogels in drug-delivery systems.

The eukaryotic cell cycle is primarily regulated by cyclin-dependant kinases and the many cyclins that differentially associate with the kinases throughout the cell cycle  Subcellular localization of cyclins is known to be an important part of human cell cycle regulation  Previous work in our lab has suggested that cytoplasmic localization of the primary mitotic cyclin, Clb2, has a signicant role in the regulation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle  I am interested in the function of Clb2 localization at the mother-bud neck, a site where regulatory proteins, including the kinase Swe1, are known to congregate  Cells depleted of cytoplasmic Clb2 were found to have elongated buds, which is characteristic of disrupted Swe1 regulation  This study is further investigating the role of Clb2 localization in Swe1 regulation and onset of mitosis.

Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) hydrolyzes various peptides and regulates several neurological and physiological processes  A cleft separates the two domains of TOP and contains the substrate-binding pocket and active site  A loop region, which is thought to be quite exible, connects the domains; changes in the loop may lead to modications in substrate specicity  To trap intermediate conformations of the loop, glycine residues within the active site were replaced with larger, less exible alanine residues  The activity of the mutants was compared to that of wild-type enzyme towards two quenched uorescent substrates  All mutants had lower activity than wild type towards a natural substrate analog, but towards a smaller substrate one mutant had higher activity  These results are consistent with data that revealed increases in activity towards the larger substrate when the enzyme is partially denatured, and presumably more exible, in addition to data revealing conformational changes under denaturing conditions.

The cell cycle is the highly regulated sequence of events that allows for proper DNA replication and correct timing of cell division  Clb2 is the primary yeast mitotic cyclin that controls entry into mitosis by binding and activating the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28  It resides predominantly in the nucleus with subpopulations at the mitotic spindle, spindle pole bodies, and the bud neck  Clb2 sub-cellular localization likely contributes to regulation of Clb2/Cdc28 activity and substrate specicity  I conducted a genetic screen and biochemical assays to elucidate the cytoplasmic roles and genetic interactions of Clb2  Knowing with which proteins cytoplasmic Clb2 interacts, we can extrapolate novel roles for Clb2 and the functional signicance of its nuclear export  By delineating the regulatory mechanisms involved in cell division, this research can aid in the understanding and treatment of tumorigenesis and cancer, which stem from dysfunctions in the cell cycle.

The N-terminal histidine of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and of exendin-4 have been shown to be critical for the activation of the pancreatic receptor (GLP-1R) which initiates insulin production  Previous amino acid substitutions of this histidine with lysine and with alanine have been interpreted to indicate the requirement for a positively charged residue in the N-terminal position  To further develop the structure-activity relationship for the interaction of the N-terminal amino acid of GLP-1 with GLP-1R, histidine analogs such as 1-imidazolyl-alanine (1), have been synthesized via Michael addition to an acrylic acid ester  Enantiomeric resolution was achieved enzymatically  The results of binding and activity studies for the incorporation of 1 and other such analogs into GLP-1 will be reported.

The protein polymer glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been shown to indirectly lower blood glucose levels in patients suffering from Type II diabetes  This effect is only observed when GLP-1 is bound to its receptor, GLP-1R  Understanding the molecular level interactions of GLP-1 and GLP-1R will allow for the targeted design of medicinal treatments for Type II diabetes  Synthesis of a histidine analog  a modied component of GLP-1 that acts as a probe  can elucidate specic interactions between GLP-1 and GLP-1R  Challenges and results of this synthesis will be discussed.

Studies have shown that peptide GLP-1 induces the production of insulin in the human body as it binds and activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), making it a promising method of treatment for diabetes mellitus  However, GLP-1 is short lived in vivo, thus it is necessary to nd binding, nonpeptide small molecule activators of GLP-1R  Although the non peptide antagonist T-0632 (1) inhibits the release of insulin, the selective binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R makes T-0632 a potential lead compound for diabetes treatment  We have developed an efcient synthesis of racemic T-0632  The resolution of T-0632 enantiomers has been attempted in two synthetic strategies via reaction with chiral alcohol to form diastereomers  Further details of the synthesis and chiral resolution will be discussed.

In 1880, educators of the deaf excluded deaf adults from an international conference in Vienna and decided to ban sign language from the classroom  Deaf adults, outraged by the decision and their exclusion, began organizing themselves  The deaf communities in Sweden, Germany, and the U S  have varying levels of organization and involvement in educational policymaking  These countries also differ signicantly in their approaches to such key questions as the educational placement of deaf students and the use of sign language in the classroom  Comparing the organizational strength and level of activism of deaf associations across Sweden, Germany, and the United States sheds important light on how these countries came to pursue their current educational policies regarding deaf students.

Italy has made some of the worlds boldest steps for womens rights and reproductive health rights in the past thirty years  Recently, legislation regulating assisted reproduction has generated a profound political controversy relating to the governments ability to control reproduction and to dene family  The United States faces many of the same questions, yet there are no overarching federal regulations placed on assisted reproductive technologies  However, the American people, as well as the legislative and judicial bodies on all levels of government continue to confront challenges presented by the use reproductive technology that has developed without a major change in the social sentiment towards family  This project is centered on eld research conducted in Italy and the U S  A number of experts and professionals in legislative, medical, judicial, and sociological elds were interviewed in order to perform a comparative analysis between the two states and their respective actions and ideas.

The links between maternal depression and childrens development, specically, the verbalizations and facial expressions of infants have long been discussed and analyzed  This issue must be viewed from a plethora of developmental perspectives  What, exactly, are the effects of maternal depression on childrens development including their speech and behaviors? What is the biological relationship between maternal and child depression, the brain, and depressed behaviors? Are mother-child interactions bidirectional? Is there a synchrony of action and reaction patterns, and if so, does that synchrony break down in interactions in dyads of depressed mothers and their children? What are the stigmatizations of mother-hood and how do they affect who is blamed for problematic child development? What kinds of research are proposed for future answers to the remaining questions?.

Within relationships, individuals seek out specic characteristics, supports, or types of interaction, known as social provisions  By the time children reach preschool age they have formed relationships with family members and peers, and many have created fantasy relationships with imaginary companions (ICs)  Whereas social provisions are inherent in real relationships, children must determine the provisions relationships with ICs will afford  This study investigates the provisions of companionship, conict, instrumental aid, power, nurturance, and reliable alliance in the relationship between a child and his/her IC  Provisions are expected to differ based on the childs gender as well as the type of IC created  Data were collected through a diary kept by parents detailing episodes in which the IC appears, as well as through parent and child interviews.

Memories crowd in on one, as one sits down to write, so begins W  Plumer Mills in a letter to his wife in January of 1938  It is Nanjing, China during the Japanese occupation; caught in this traumatic event, how do individuals react and remember through the act of writing? By using the unpublished letters of American missionary W  Plumer Mills to his family, I examine how he tried to make sense of the atrocities that were occurring around him, based on his previous experiences  Ultimately, such primary sources shed light on the documenters of history in the midst of a traumatic event, and how their attitudes and assumptions, as well as other factors, help to shape what they write and, consequently, what we remember today.

In the 1920s, emerging paradigms of new women in diverse regional contexts pointed to gender identities in the process of change throughout the world  Colonial Korea, too, witnessed the rise of a discourse on the new woman during this decade  A comprehensive examination of the Sin Yosong (New Woman) magazine from the 1920s unveils the journalistic construction of the Korean new woman  Closely linked to broader agendas such as nationalism, and signaling the onset of colonial modernity, the making of new womanhood in Korea illuminates the historical circumstances that prompted womens identities to change  The main themes of individualism, motherhood, and social backlash that appear in Sin Yosong contribute new perspectives to the relationship between nationalism and feminism in colonial societies.

Across the world, women are plagued by violence and harassment  Due to the sexist bias inherent in Irans rigid Muslim society, women often suffer as silent victims of domestic abuse, and institutions to help these victims are only beginning to emerge  When approaching this topic, however, a Westerner must understand that gender inequalities that might be inexcusable in the United States are conventional in Iran  While rejecting the societys prejudice against women, it is important to fully grasp the complex role of women in Iranian society today  Westerners often fail to accurately assess the power held by women in the Middle Eastern culture  In addition to recent developments in the realm of domestic violence, this presentation will explore the unique role of women in Irans changing society, including their signicant achievements over the last few years in politics and education.

Since the collapse of the USSR, Russia has experienced a dramatic rise in poverty together with the shrinking of the welfare state  The economic transition placed particular groups of women in a lower income group than men and had the ancillary effect of weakening their political representation  Womens movements are only starting to develop in Russia  To gain a deeper understanding of the situation, the Russian case must be put in international comparative perspective  In addition to Russia, I examine how women have reacted to poverty and social exclusion in Brazil where womens organizations have successfully utilized the mechanisms offered by civil society and democracy to promote their beliefs and highlight issues  In comparing Russia and Brazil, I aim to evaluate what impact the voice of women has had on the lives of the poorest women, those with little access to income, power, and democratic representation.

Previous studies have shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in vertebrate cardiac muscle are activated during periods of decreased oxygen availability through a nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic-GMP (cGMP) mediated pathway  The purpose of my study was to determine whether activation of this ion channel in the heart plays a protective role in a species highly tolerant of low oxygen environments, the goldsh (Carassius auratus)  A cellular model of environmental hypoxia was used to examine the effects of altered channel activity on isolated myocytes  Channel activation, via the presumed agonists diazoxide, SNAP, and 8-Br-cGMP, increased the survival rate of the cells under hypoxic conditions  In addition, patch-clamp experiments are currently being used to study the effects of these drugs on single channels in an effort to distinguish the cardioprotective effects of activating KATP channels at two different locations in the cell: the sarcolemma and the mitochondrial inner membrane.

Persistent neural activity, a sustained level of neuronal response following the presentation of a transient stimulus, is thought to be the neural correlate of short-term memory  Most previous models assume that single cells are incapable of intrinsically maintaining persistence and require implausibly ne-tuned positive feedback provided by a neural network  We propose that the ne tuning is not necessary if a cell contains a bistable mechanism distributed across multiple individual dendritic compartments  I am using the program NEURON to construct a model cell capable of generating action potentials and receiving input through individual dendritic compartments  These compartments contain bistable properties mediated by ionic channels shown to underlie dendritic plateau potentials  Once these bistable properties have been established in individual dendrites, I will test whether coupling dendrites will allow the neuron to exhibit multiple levels of persistent neural activity.

Over 85% of all cancers begin in the epithelium, and are often preceded by a precancerous state known as dysplasia  This makes the identication of dysplasia very important as it allows for treatment of lesions when they are still in a noninvasive stage  An alternative to current detection methods is to use optical techniques to identify the changes characteristic of dysplasia and make a minimally invasive, real-time diagnosis  These optical techniques are based on spectroscopy  Light is delivered and collected via an optical bre probe that is small enough to be placed in the accessory channel of an endoscope  The goal of my thesis research project is to optimize the design of the optical bre probe which is a critical component of this system.

Hydrogels are polymer networks that undergo stimuli-responsive volume phase transitions, in which the gels contract and expel their contents into their surroundings  Control of this behavior has prompted much research for use of hydro-gels as stimuli-responsive drug-carriers  My research investigates two modications of gel thermoresponsive phase transition: the variation of gel composition and the addition of in situ gold nanoparticles  Gels were synthesized using thermosensitive N-isopropylacrylamide as the polymer backbone and using 0 00-3 50% wt  of N,N-methylenebisacry-lamide (MBAm) and/or N,N-cystaminebisacrylamide (CBAm) as crosslinking agents, and were then embedded with in situ gold nanoparticles  UV spectroscopy revealed that the phase transitions of in situ gold samples with high concentrations of CBAm widened the most  Mass and diameter measurements of in situ gold gels with high concentrations of CBAm and low concentrations of MBAm were also substantially larger than gels that had lower concentrations of CBAm and/or higher concentrations of MBAm.

Thermosensitive hydrogels are polymer networks that swell and deswell with temperature changes due to polymer-polymer and polymer-water interactions  Hydrogel copolymers of N-isopropylacrylamide and acrylic acid, poly (NIPAm-co-AAc), were synthesized with varying concentrations of N,N-cystaminebisacrylamide (CBAm) and N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAm) as crosslinking agents  Gold nanostructures were synthesized within the poly (NIPAm-co-AAc) hydrogels  The phase transition temperatures and swelling properties of both the native and gold-containing poly (NIPAm-co-AAc) hydrogels were studied using mass measurements over a range of temperatures  The results of these studies are compared to those of gels without acrylic acid in the polymer backbone  Dried hydrogels were loaded with a uorescent-labeled model drug, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled dextran  TMR-dextran release proles for the NIPAm-coAAc hydrogels were studied using uorometry  The results of this research are applicable to the employment of thermoresponsive hydrogels in drug-delivery systems.

The response to the 1997 East Asian crisis differed across countries  Some countries, like South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand, responded with increased nancial liberalization in order to obtain IMF approved bailouts and loans  On the other hand Malaysia chose to restrict capital mobility by establishing controls on outows of hot money  I present the results of a study that examines both the impact of capital controls over time as well as their distributional impact  The hypothesis is that a nancial crisis exposes cronyism, which can then be eliminated by increased liberalization  On the other hand, the use of capital controls provides cover for continued cronyism and allows companies to delay much-needed restructuring  I test this hypothesis using an econometric analysis comparing the performance of politically connected Malaysian and Indonesian rms and Korean chaebols against one another and against their nonconnected counterparts.

A variety of gambling options, from lottos to horse racing to commercial casinos, are available in many states today  Swelling these ranks recently are Indian casinos, some of which are both larger and more protable than the casinos in Las Vegas  Though Indian casinos are sometimes described as agents of economic development, many state governments worry not only about their effects on employment and crime, but also on the potential competition they present to state-run lotteries  I examine here, through econometric analysis, whether Indian casinos and lotteries represent substitute gambling products to consumers  I also analyze whether any cannibalization of lottery revenues by Indian casinos might be offset by the potentially positive impact of such casinos on sales tax revenue  I hope that the results of this study help clarify important questions surrounding the use of Indian casinos to enhance state economies.

The authority to write an authentic maritime narrative is best gained by using ones own sea journal to recreate the experience  Even so, a seafaring writers background places constraints on the ultimate authenticity of the narrative  In creating a literary work from a sea journal, and thus transitioning from a private to public genre, authors infuse social commentary with their personal reections  The journal-based sea narratives of Richard Henry Dana, Jr , Herman Melville, and John Steinbeck reect each authors efforts to authentically recreate the social and natural dimensions of life at sea  My research, inspired by my own journal kept at sea, evaluates the authority and authenticity of Danas Two Years Before the Mast, Melvilles Redburn and Moby-Dick, and Steinbecks Log from the Sea of Cortez and Cannery Row.

More than just an exceedingly long novel about whales, Herman Melvilles Moby-Dick explores themes that span human experience as a whole, from the limits of freedom to the struggle of individuality against society  Behind these themes lies a rich American Romantic tradition, of which the leading gure is Ralph Waldo Emerson  In his early essays, Emerson stresses the importance of the isolating romantic quest in order to transcend the limitations of Nature, self, and society, radically invoking the divinity of man  Melville strikes a very different chord from Emerson in Moby-Dick, depicting the fall of a tragic hero who stubbornly believes in transgressing the boundaries of self and society  By doing so, Melville emphasizes the dangers of Emersons faith in the divinity of man, for destruction and death are the only fruits of Captain Ahabs hubris.

In 1745, many of the Narragansett Indians living on reservation lands in the Rhode Island colony adopted Christianity  Although this once powerful and inuential population had been introduced decades earlier to Christian principles by visiting missionaries and colonists, it was not until a series of religious revivals that gripped the American colonies during the middle of the eighteenth century that the Narragansetts chose Christian conversion  The Great Awakening, as the revivals came to be known, challenged traditional forms of Protestant worship and church hierarchy, encouraging some members to create an alternate vision of their religious traditions within separate congregations  Like many of their English neighbors, the Narragansetts were also affected by the Awakenings evangelical message of personal empowerment  In response, the Narragansetts were prompted to creatively interpret New Light worship within their own religious framework, shaping a Christian identity that derived sacred power from a new source: The Englishmans God.

Discrimination and marginalization are not themes unique to any particular culture, but in fact have been pervasive throughout history in all parts of the world  In Japan, Sumii Sue wrote about the struggles of a burakumin or outcaste family in her novel The River with No Bridge (1957) reacting to the unfair treatment she had witnessed towards this group  Meanwhile in Mexico, Rosario Castellanos presented the interracial tensions between the Maya Indian minority and the white landowners of Chiapas through her novel, The Nine Guardians (1961)  Although the novels come from different literary traditions, both writers were committed to presenting the struggles of both minorities to promote social change  The ethical representations of these minorities are evident within common themes such as the struggle for education, the unity of family and the strong ties to nature.

Aldous Huxley once said, Culture is like the sum of special knowledge that accumulates in any large united family and is the common property of all its members  Using cultural and cognitive sociology, I have gone back and studied the large united family in which I was raised, the Ukrainian Catholic Church  My case study of two neighboring churches examines two of the biggest phenomena affecting any organization  change and conict  Like many ethnic or specialized churches that face issues of declining membership and scal instability, they have spent two decades in a struggle for their very survival  One of them has fared signicantly better in doing so, and this research offers a window into the why of their relative success - the key is in their culture.

Cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, are the only prokaryotic organisms that carry out oxygenic photosynthesis  They appear to be highly adaptable because they exist in environments with high temperatures or high salt concentrations  However they are not found in many acidic conditions because they grow best at alkaline pH  This study focuses on whether cyanobacteria can build up an acid tolerance response in order to survive in an acidic environment  The organisms were pre-exposed to mildly acidic media buffered at pH 6 3 and provided with 5% carbon dioxide and air  After the initial adaptation period, the cells were then transferred into media buffered at pH 5 5  The results showed that cyanobacteria were able to grow at the mildly acidic environment, but did not exhibit an acid tolerance response when placed into a lower pH because there was no growth  The trials were performed using different cell densities, but the pattern of growth was the same for each density.

Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803 has been shown to grow optimally at phH 7 5-10  However, little research has been performed on the effect of acid stress on any cyanobacterium  My goal was to characterize the acid stress response of strain 6803 cells, the rst cyanobacterium to have its DNA sequenced  Growth and viability studies showed that cells grown in medium buffered at pH 5 2 stopped growing and lost viability  To identify the acid stress proteins of strain 6803, cells were incubated in medium buffered at different acidic pHs and then broken  Proteins were then separated by 2-D gel electrophoresis and trypsin digested to be identied by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer  Protein analyses showed that 8 to 30% of the total cell proteins were upregulated or downregulated, 19 to 23% disappeared and 23 to 30% were newly induced upon acid stress.

Cyanobacteria are found in a wide variety of habitats due to their ability to survive in extreme and stressful conditions  The research in this laboratory on bacterial biochemistry and physiology aims to understand the relationship between environmental changes and stress on the structure and function of cyanobacteria  Our research investigates the effects of different nitrogen sources and nitrogen starvation on the enzyme, nitrate reductase, in a strain of nonnitrogen-xing cyanobacteria  The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of nitrate to nitrite, an integral step in nitrate assimilation  This research explores nitrogen control in cyanobacteria, a common phenomenon among microorganisms, through which the assimilatory pathways of some nitrogen sources is repressed when a more easily assimilated nitrogen source is available.

How do cyanobacteria survive in lakes and ponds made increasingly acid by air pollution? Some studies have shown that one of the acid stress coping mechanisms of microorganisms is to maintain a neutral or slightly alkaline internal pH, also known as pH homeostasis  Moreover, studies on E  coli have suggested that the use of a sodium/proton antiporter, a protein embedded in the cell membrane that carries one substance in one direction (into the cell) and a second substance in the opposite direction (out of the cell), is involved in maintaining pH homeostasis under alkaline conditions  Do cyanobacteria share a similar coping mechanism under stress? By using 31P NMR and 23Na spectroscopy, I am investigating whether a cyanobacterial strain, Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803, maintains pH homeostasis and employs a Na+/H+ antiporter as a part of the homeostasis system under acid stress.

Cyanobacteria are aquatic and photosynthetic microorganisms which are often unicellular, though they may grow in colonies large enough to be seen  Most cyanobacteria contain nitrogen storage molecules to guard against nitrogen starvation  In some strains of cyanobacteria, the main nitrogen storage polymer is multi-L-arginine-poly (L-aspartic acid), or cyanophycin granule polypeptide (CGP)  Cyanobacteria also contain a second nitrogen storage molecule known as phycocyanin  Studying the relationship between these two types of nitrogen storage molecules under conditions of nutrient stress illustrates the adaptation of cyanobacteria to a range of environmental conditions in which the levels of nitrogen available to them vary widely  Using cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6308, we compared the uptake of two different nitrogen isotopes in cyanophycin during nitrogen starvation and after refeeding  With the use of 1H NMR and UV-Visible Spectroscopy, we observed a correlation between an increase in the amount of phycocyanin and the presence of both 14N and 15N in the cyanophycin.

Cyanobacteria are able to cope with many environmental stresses, one of which is acid stress  Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6308 has been shown to increase the pH of its growth medium when placed in a low pH medium  We are looking specically for amino acid decarboxylases, which would break down certain amino acids in the external environment to a more basic form  It was found that cyanobacteria cells are able to grow well in amino acid supplemented media  In addition, assays to determine whether or not decarboxylases are present showed that the cells in all growth conditions with amino acid supplements, as well as in the control which did not have any amino acid in its external environment, contained decarboxylases.

Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide chemical, physiological, anatomical and functional information about living tissue without surgery or other invasive procedures  Thus MRI and MRS are uniquely useful tools in developmental studies because we can monitor the progress of a single subject over a period of time  Our project incorporates the study of biochemistry and neurological disease as we apply MRS to monitor neurochemistry during postnatal development in the search for early indicators of Rett Syndrome, a developmental disorder of young girls, in a mouse model  By observing variations in the concentrations of neurochemicals associated with Rett Syndrome and comparing them to abnormalities related to other diseases, we may gain insight into the chemical mechanisms of this devastating disorder, how it can be detected early and possible avenues of treatment, as well as into the roles of the neurochemicals themselves.

Serotonin plays a crucial role in neurological activities  In particular, it has been demonstrated to be important in neurogenesis and neurodevelopmental diseases  This study aims to investigate the production of serotonin in lobster and mouse brain using contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  We have designed a targeted contrast agent that visualizes the activity of 5-tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), a competent marker of serotonin production  The contrast agent will indicate the presence of TPH by chemical interactions with the TPH in its environment  The designed molecule was synthesized and characterized using various techniques, such as uorescence spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy and MRI  A further study will focus on its efcacy in in vivo system.

Rett (RTT) Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disease, striking mostly girls, that is rapidly gaining attention  Volumetric MRI has proven to be benecial in the study of RTT in humans by providing opportunities to track the abnormal brain development associated with the disease  A mouse model of Rett Syndrome is now available at Wellesley College  Using Wellesleys micro-MRI system, volumetric MRI has been implemented on RTT mice in order to gain a more complete picture of what goes awry in the rst postnatal month  Ultimately, longitudinal volumetric comparisons will be made between RTT and wildtype mice  The implication of this study is that signicant brain volumetric changes early in development may be used as a new marker for the diagnosis of Rett Syndrome.

MEMRI is a technique that uses the natural properties of manganese ions to enhance images of the nervous system  Due to the relative simplicity of the nervous systems of invertebrates, our research is conducted on the craysh species Cherax destructor  While most contrast agents produce improved images that still reect only anatomical structure, manganese ions can produce contrast that is contingent upon their active uptake by neurons, offering the possibility of activity-dependent imaging of neural tracts and pathways  Our project takes two approaches  Firstly, the use of manganese, and its application, is being rened to the point where the resulting images could approach the resolution shown in histological studies, enabling longitudinal studies where the craysh is unharmed by the low dosages of manganese used  Secondly, by correlating electroretinography (ERG) recordings with MEMRI results we could produce functional images of the craysh visual system.

Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes a range of debilitating symptoms in females and still-birth or early death in males  Over 75% of RTT cases are due to mutations in the X chromosome-linked gene that encodes the transcription repressor protein, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)  Compared to healthy brains, RTT brains appear to have a 30% volume reduction, however, this decrease is not uniform throughout the brain  One region showing a marked volume reduction is the striatum, a structure involved in motor control  This study quanties volumes of MeCP2-null mice compared to their wild-type littermates  AMIRA software will be used to trace manually the striatum and calculate striatal volumes  Changes in striatum volume may help to explain the degeneration of purposeful movement observed in the MeCP2-null mice and in RTT patients.

Mutations in the X-linked gene encoding MeCP2 are responsible for over 75% of all cases of Rett Syndrome (RTT): a neurodevelopmental disorder debilitating 1 in 10,000-22,000 females  RTT individuals display moderate to severe mental retardation and neuropathological evidence indicates abnormal development of the cholinergic neurotransmitter system  In normal individuals, choline supplementation during development alters the cholinergic system and facilitates improvements in adult memory  We hypothesize that choline supplementation of MeCP2 mutant mice, an animal model of RTT, will improve cognitive decits  MeCP2 mutant and wildtype mice were supplemented with either 25 mM choline / 50 mM saccharin (test) or 50 mM saccharin alone (control) from embryonic day (ED) 10 to weaning (3 weeks)  At approximately 4 weeks, reexes, locomotion, and associative learning were assessed  These results may provide a potential pharmaceutical intervention to reverse the cognitive impairments observed in RTT.

Previous studies have shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in vertebrate cardiac muscle are activated during periods of decreased oxygen availability through a nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic-GMP (cGMP) mediated pathway  The purpose of my study was to determine whether activation of this ion channel in the heart plays a protective role in a species highly tolerant of low oxygen environments, the goldsh (Carassius auratus)  A cellular model of environmental hypoxia was used to examine the effects of altered channel activity on isolated myocytes  Channel activation, via the presumed agonists diazoxide, SNAP, and 8-Br-cGMP, increased the survival rate of the cells under hypoxic conditions  In addition, patch-clamp experiments are currently being used to study the effects of these drugs on single channels in an effort to distinguish the cardioprotective effects of activating KATP channels at two different locations in the cell: the sarcolemma and the mitochondrial inner membrane.

The Pink-Plumed Poppy (Macleaya cordata) is an invasive weed that quickly dominates unsuspecting gardens with its imposing six-foot tall, leggy presence  However, despite its reputation as a gardeners worst nightmare, the plant remains an intriguing oddity, due to its unusual ability to completely shed water (much like the most expensive of raincoats)  While previous studies have determined that the hydrophobicity of many plants is a physical property of surface roughness, as well as microscopic waxy crystals on the surface of the leaves, there is evidence that suggests that the chemical constituents of a plant may affect the physical integrity of its surface  This presentation will discuss how one determines the chemical constituents in a plant, as well as the different characteristics that make something waterproof.

Argentina and other Rockhopper and African penguins at the New England Aquarium communicate using bray and contact calls  Penguins and many species that breed in large colonies use sound as a means of recognizing individuals and conspecics  Are different call characteristics used in discrimination at the individual, subspecies, or species level? Over a period of three months I recorded contact and bray calls of 65 individuals from three species of penguins at the New England Aquarium  Calls were displayed as sonograms and a variety of sound variables were measured  Using discriminant analysis, I showed that main frequency and the average length of the syllable were most important in distinguishing among species, but that syllable amplitude and frequency patterns appear to be necessary to discriminate among individuals  The ability of species level cues to discriminate between subspecies of Rockhoppers supports their separation at the species level.

Development, Dialog and Delivery (D-lab) is a course at MIT that presents problems that third-world countries face, introduces us to possible solutions and gives us the opportunity to gain rsthand experience through an optional site-specic visit  Billions of people in nations all over the world are living in underdeveloped, rural areas far below the poverty line  Living from day to day, many lack connectivity to the outside world, proper health care, electricity, and the availability of a basic education  We will share our experiences in the third world communities of Brazil and Honduras  Our projects focused on the application of appropriate technologies including grey water recycling, water quality analysis, and computer application  We will talk about our own, personal encounters with the simplest of technologies that can improve the quality of life for individuals all over the world.

The rst of Chaucers Canterbury Tales is narrated by a Christian, set in the time of the legendary Greek hero Theseus, and tells of the contest between two Theban knights for the hand of a beautiful Amazon  My thesis unravels the tales twisted equations of power, as each character  the two knights, Theseus, the beautiful Emilia, her sister Hippolyta, the gods  and the narrator, Chaucers part gentil knyght, shares a space within the complex, diverse power structure of the tale  In addition to Honors work, I studied medieval England in situ, and attended a conference on Chaucer and Vision in March  My senior year has been a pilgrimage that has helped synthesize my life experiences with my study of medieval language and literature  During this presentation I will address both the Knights Tale and also my experiences in medieval/Renaissance England and modern-day academia.

Amid the predictions and prescriptions for regime change or reform in the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK), studies on North Korea fail to consider the prospects for corruption in reforming the communist state  Historical examples illustrate the dangers of pressing for change while overlooking the potential for greater or different types of corruption that emerge during the time of transition  Each of the three prospective reform paths that the DPRK can take  the rapid, shock therapy reform path of central and eastern European countries like Romania, the Chinese path of economic liberalization under communism, and the South Korean path following the East Asian developmental state model  is rife with a particular form of corruption  If the DPRK adopts any of these reform models, North Korea, as well as the international community, must consider the likelihood of the country reproducing Romanias large unofcial economy, Chinas bureaucratic corruption, or South Koreas crony capitalist system.

The Pink-Plumed Poppy (Macleaya cordata) is an invasive weed that quickly dominates unsuspecting gardens with its imposing six-foot tall, leggy presence  However, despite its reputation as a gardeners worst nightmare, the plant remains an intriguing oddity, due to its unusual ability to completely shed water (much like the most expensive of raincoats)  While previous studies have determined that the hydrophobicity of many plants is a physical property of surface roughness, as well as microscopic waxy crystals on the surface of the leaves, there is evidence that suggests that the chemical constituents of a plant may affect the physical integrity of its surface  This presentation will discuss how one determines the chemical constituents in a plant, as well as the different characteristics that make something waterproof.

Study of habitat selection has a long history in avian ecology, and much of what we know may be wrong  The purpose of this project was to test the hypothesis that birds select neighborhoods of conspecics in which to breed rather than as has been traditionally thought by assessing habitat features  As a rst step in testing this hypothesis, we determined whether Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) used public information  conspecic song  to select breeding territories  We predicted that bluebirds would settle and nest at higher density where playback of conspecic song was provided  To test this prediction, we provided song during the period of territory settlement to one of two sets of three boxes placed in each of six replicate meadows  Results of this ongoing study will contribute to basic understanding of avian habitat selection and will add to the tools needed for songbird conservation.

Argentina and other Rockhopper and African penguins at the New England Aquarium communicate using bray and contact calls  Penguins and many species that breed in large colonies use sound as a means of recognizing individuals and conspecics  Are different call characteristics used in discrimination at the individual, sub-species, or species level? Over a period of three months I recorded contact and bray calls of 65 individuals from three species of penguins at the New England Aquarium  Calls were displayed as sonograms and a variety of sound variables were measured  Using discriminant analysis, I showed that main frequency and the average length of the syllable were most important in distinguishing among species, but that syllable amplitude and frequency patterns appear to be necessary to discriminate among individuals  The ability of species level cues to discriminate between sub-species of Rockhoppers supports their separation at the species level.

Plants sense their surrounding light environment and adapt to changes in light quality, quantity, and direction  For example, plants can move their chloroplasts into or out of the light in order to maximize their photosynthetic behavior  Two phototropins (phot1 and phot 2) perceive blue light signals and initiate a signal transduction pathway resulting in a change in chloroplast position and orientation  We will present data showing how chloroplast number and size inuence the ability of chloroplasts to move in response to changes in light intensity, and how that in turn impacts the photosynthetic behavior of leaves  We will present results of a proteomic approach that hopes to yield information about the downstream members of the signaling cascade of the photoreceptors phot1 and phot2  Finally, we will show evidence that blue light does not only trigger chloroplast movement but also impacts mitochondrial shape and movement.

Over the past thirty years, the United Nations has generated novel institutions aimed at spawning intergovernmental and international cooperation to creatively solve environmental problems of great consequence to the world  From an incredible spirit of international cooperation, the United Nations created the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to serve as the locus for international environmental cooperation  Designed as a decentralized body, the overall effectiveness of UNEP is heavily debated  To ll the governance gap, the international community produced environmental conventions, witnessed the growth of NGOs and generated the Global Environment Facility (GEF), an innovative funding mechanism  However, with environmental crises multiplying, the future of environmental governance is uncertain  Through investigating the international environmental institutions, NGOs and the debate surrounding a centralized body, I am striving to discern if centralization is the future of environmental governance.

To investigate the mechanisms that allow chloroplasts to move along the actin cytoskeleton in Arabidopsis thaliana, we are inspecting stable EMS-mutants as well as genotyping T-DNA insertional mutants to establish homozygous mutant lines  Using confocal microscopy and leaf transmission data we are examining the effects of mutations in genes involved in chloroplast division on the actin cytoskeleton and characterizing a novel mutant exhibiting a few large chloroplasts and inhibited movement  We are also studying chloroplast movement and the associated changes in actin structure and arrangement within the guard cells, which regulate the opening and closing of the plants stomata.

The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone released when there are high levels of glucose in the body  GLP-1 induces the production and release of insulin when bound to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R)  The non-peptide antagonist of the GLP-1R, T-0632 (1), inhibits the activation of GLP-1R by GLP-1  The binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R includes amino acid residues involved in the activation of the receptor  Utilizing the selectivity of T-0632 binding to the GLP-1R and known parameters for receptor activation, structural modifications can be made to T-0632 to form agonists of GLP-1R, thus creating a series of potential lead drug compounds for diabetes treatment  T-0632 can be efficiently synthesized in nine steps  This synthesis and the preparation of the active variations of T-0632 will be discussed  Binding profiles and c-AMP induction activities of the T-0632 analogs will be presented.

The 30-residue glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is the natural activator of the GLP- 1 receptor (GLP-1R), inducing the production and secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta cells  A 39-residue peptide isolated from Gila monster venom, Exendin-4 (Ex-4), has been shown to be an agonist of the GLP-1R  A truncated Ex-4 is used to examine the flexibility of the peptides Nt erminal activating region, in the context of GLP-1R activation and insulin stimulation  Currently, a nonpeptide tether is being used to attach the natural GLP-1 N-terminal tripeptide molecule to the binding region of truncated Ex-4  Our goal is to alter Ex-4 such that the synthetic agonist has improved binding ability along with consistent activation of GLP-1R  Experimental synthesis mechanisms and the progress of synthesis will be presented.

Beautiful, sensuously tactile, witty, and employing materials as diverse as copper pipes, latex, soap, and organza, the signify cant work of the late American artist Rachel bas-Cohain engaged the political and art historical contexts that informed its production  In the early 1970s, bas- Cohain joined a growing number of feminist artists determined to subvert the masculinism of the white, male art establishment  Through their activism and artistic production these women effected profound change, creating new exhibition opportunities for themselves and other under-represented artists while undermining exclusionary modernist art criticism  Art historically neglected, the body of bas-Cohains conceptual work remains outside the dominant paradigm of feminist art, which often reclaimed materials, processes, and subject matter coded and debased as feminine  This presentation will consider the subversive, socially engaged feminist production of Rachel bas-Cohain, whose promising career was abruptly ended by her premature death.

Elaine Aron defines a Highly Sensitive Person, or HSP, as a person who was born with an extremely sensitive nervous system  Aron identifies aesthetic sensitivity and interest in the arts as characteristic of the highly sensitive temperament, but she does not support her assumption with adequate empirical research  Aron also describes the highly sensitive person as having a rich inner life  Aesthetic orientation and inner life measures were used in a survey of 100 Wellesley College students to assess whether or not a relationship exists between the highly sensitive temperament and aesthetic orientation  Results will be discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the developmental relationship between biological temperament and adult personality.

Since 1986, northern Uganda has been ravaged by a war between the government of Uganda and a rebel group called the Lords Resistance Army  In the last 20 years, over 40,000 children have been abducted, half a million people displaced, and still the war ravages on  In order to address some of the effects that have arisen out of the last two decades of conflict, there are various nongovernmental organizations in northern Uganda that are employing diverse methods and mechanisms in their rehabilitation/ reintegration/community-building programs  and in these programs, theatre and performance have come to play an important role  My thesis explores this theatre of war as it has come into being in northern Uganda as well as considers how political playwriting techniques can be employed in order to address this war from the outside.

The glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (A), once considered the antibiotic of last resort, has seen the development of many strains of resistant bacteria over the past twenty years  Several attempts to overcome this resistance have focused on functionalizing the amino group of a peripheral carbohydrate component of vancomycin, known as the vancosamine sugar  Here, we present recent progress towards the development of an entirely new derivative of vancomycin that incorporates a septanose residue at the vancosamine position (B)  The septanose residue is the result of a formal one carbon homologation of the natural vancosamine sugar  Vancomycin derivative B shows promise as a potential analog that can be used combat vancomycin resistant strains of bacteria.

Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with mental retardation in females  It is characterized by normal development from birth to six months, when motor and cognitive skills plateau and eventually decline  RTT is due to mutations in the X-linked gene that encodes a transcriptional repressor protein  Brain volumes in RTT are 30% smaller than normal  These data and behavioral research led us to hypothesize that in RTT there are selective decreases in brain regions involved in cognitive and motor skills  We tested this hypothesis in brains of a mouse model of RTT  Indeed, we found decreases in whole brain volume, as well as in regions associated with motor (the striatum), memory (the hippocampus), and anxiety (the amygdala) functions  These studies provide insights into the relationship between brain structure and function in this developmental disorder, as well as in normal humans.

In this project we are trying to determine the pharmacokinetics of a novel monoclonal antibody believed to recognize a surface protein expressed on pancreatic cancer cells  Since previous observations have shown that the antibody target protein is preferentially internalized in cancerous tissue of the colon, we intend to map the accumulation site, timeline, and genetic impact of the internalization process in both pancreatic and colon cell lines  Based on the accumulated knowledge, we will investigate novel ways of destroying malignant cell populations.

The crystal structure of the mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) from E  coli represents a unique channel structure with intriguing heptameric symmetry and significant soluble domains  There are several families of membrane proteins related to MscS channels, including a recently identified family of ion channels, the bCNG channels, putatively gated by cyclic nucleotides  In this study, we performed pair-wise multiple sequence alignments to evaluate sequence conservation within the bCNG family  Using the MODELLER program, we have produced homology models of the cyclic nucleotide binding domains of the channels and verified them using a variety of protein structure verification methods  We have begun to refine these models using molecular dynamics simulations  These simulations can also give us insight into the role these domains play in channel function  Overall, these models will play a critical role in developing experiments to characterize the structure-function relationships of these channels.

Cationic antimicrobial peptides are important players in the innate immune response of organisms from bacteria to insects to humans  These peptides are active against a broad range of microorganisms, exhibit fast response times to infection, and rarely select for resistant bacterial strains  Over 500 such peptides have been isolated and fall into four structural groups  Buforin II is a 21-amino acid peptide belonging to the amphipathic, -helical group, which includes the well-characterized peptide magainin 2  Currently, it is believed that buforin exhibits its antimicrobial activity by translocating across cell membranes and binding to DNA, thereby interfering with intracellular processes and leading to cell death  In order to further understand buforins mechanism of action, we are developing vesicle assays to study the chemical properties necessary for translocation of buforin and its analogues across lipid bilayers.

In the ever growing battle of mankind versus disease comes an ancient solution that may tip the scale for future generations: antimicrobial peptides  Antimicrobial peptides are instrumental in many plant and animal systems for the prevention of diseases as bacteria and viruses generally have not developed immunity to these special proteins  Buforin= II is an example of one of these antimicrobial peptides found in Asian toads  The goal of our research is to investigate how Buforin II interacts with DNA and whether these interactions are related to its potency against bacteria  We will discuss how this research project changed our perception of biochemistry as well as its application to the real world.

Several Africana Studies majors and minors attended a national conference on Black Studies at Michigan State University (MSU), a Research 1 institution, in April 2006  The seniors who provided campus leadership for the MSU panel on the same topic, The Hip-Hop Speaks, will share practical advice from the planning and preparations of their scholarship for academic audiences  Focusing on the idea of legacy education, these representatives of the youngest generation of Black Studies scholars have a message for first years and sophomores who have not declared their major(s)/minor fields of study  Specifically, these Africana Studies seniors offer cumulative reflections about the societal relevance of intellectualized, Black experiences and how this knowledge can facilitate a dynamic, liberal arts education.

In the last five years, Russian enterprise performance has improved hand-inhand with the growing economy, but the question as to what has driven this performance remains an open one  Is the improved performance of enterprises during the oil boom a result of good policies in the form of economic reforms, or just a result of good luck in the form of high oil prices? Using an enterprise survey conducted by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, I analyze whether economic policies have had a significant impact on performance of Russian companies during the current oil boom  Understanding whether the improved economic performance is a result of good policy or of good luck is important for determining whether the Russian economy is diverse and robust enough to sustain its current positive growth trends.

Spain has undergone tremendous economic and political transformations over the last fifty years  Accession into the European Community in 1986 represents one of the key junctures in Spains process of economic transformation that began in 1959  Of the many adjustments associated with the liberalization and restructuring of the economy following accession, some of the most significant changes occurred in the area of trade policy  Using a gravity model, I explore the effects of Spains trade liberalization program upon its bilateral and sectoral trade patterns  The results will help better our understanding of what lies in store for the ten East European countries that are joining the European Union.

We have conducted a theoretical study of the response of Bose Einstein Condensed (BEC) atoms in a double slit experiment  We have predicted the interference patterns that are expected to form on the screen, which provide evidence for the wave nature of these atoms in quantum theory  We contrasted these interference patterns with those from atoms in the uncondensed phase, or thermal atoms  This gives an experimental signature of the presence of BEC atoms in the system, which distinguishes them from atoms in the uncondensed phase  We also compared the patterns from condensed atoms with varying levels of interatomic interactions  This also provides information about the effect of the strength of inter-atomic interactions on the BEC cloud.

We use a method called variational wavefunction Monte Carlo to investigate a class of high temperature superconductors known as the cuprates  In particular, we study the groundstate properties of two popular spin-only models: the Heisenberg model and the Extended Heisenberg model  These models are approximations to the true Hamiltonian for many-electron systems when electron repulsion is strong  We have written Monte Carlo programs that compute the energies of several quantum-mechanical wavefunctions, proposed as groundstates, for these models  The Heisenberg model has been studied previously, and we compare results with the literature  The Extended Heisenberg model contains a ring-exchange term that has not been investigated previously, and we are the first to look at this term using the variational wavefuntion Monte Carlo method.

Much recent medical research has been concentrated on the role of protein folding in disease progression  Many forces in proteins contribute to their final structure, including hydrogen bonding  A thioamide functional group was used to look more closely at hydrogen bonding within the betasheet secondary structure of a peptide  Making small changes at the molecular level will provide increased understanding of how the thioamide linkage affects the overall protein structure  This information will assist in our understanding of the role of the hydrogen bond and will provide a better understanding about the biophysics of the thioamide functional group.

Office of Dean of the College Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is a soluble metalloendopeptidase that has been isolated in a variety of cell types, such as the brain, pituitary, and testis tissue  TOP metabolizes a variety of bioactive peptides and is implicated in the regulation of several physiological processes, including blood pressure control, reproduction, and the immune response  Results from several laboratories, including our own, suggest that TOP can metabolize an unusually wide range of substrates due to flexibility conferred by glycine residues present in the binding pocket  In our study, we have conducted experiments using mutant forms of TOP with two substrates of different size in order to specifically study the role of the binding sites flexibility in accepting such a wide range of substrates.

The crystal structure of the mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) from E  coli represents a unique channel structure with intriguing heptameric symmetry and significant soluble domains  There are several families of membrane proteins related to MscS channels, including a recently identified family of ion channels, the bCNG channels, putatively gated by cyclic nucleotides  In this study, we performed pair-wise multiple sequence alignments to evaluate sequence conservation within the bCNG family  Using the MODELLER program, we have produced homology models of the cyclic nucleotide binding domains of the channels and verified them using a variety of protein structure verification methods  We have begun to refine these models using molecular dynamics simulations  These simulations can also give us insight into the role these domains play in channel function  Overall, these models will play a critical role in developing experiments to characterize the structure-function relationships of these channels.

Sciences The unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803 is an aquatic and photosynthetic microorganism that is a good model organism for physiological and biochemical studies due to the availability of its complete genome sequence  Synechocystis responds to different cues from its environment that affect expression of genes and synthesis of proteins related to different environmental stresses  The acid stress response of Synechocystis is being used to understand survival mechanisms in these cells  In this study, stationary-phase proteins produced as a result of acid stress at pH 6 2 were characterized through growth studies, viability studies, and proteomic analyses  The up-regulation or down-regulation of genes encoding acid-stress proteins will provide a good indication of the important roles the proteins play in the maintenance of DNA, transcription, translation, biosynthesis of amino acids, regulation of key pathways, photosynthesis, respiration and other crucial pathways, thus increasing the knowledge regarding the acid stress response of Synechocystis.

Cyanobacteria are ancient prokaryotic organisms that have been able to adapt to stressful environments  In times of stress it is possible that some cyanobacteria form biofilms in order to maximize survival  A biofilm is a community of organisms living together on a biotic or abiotic surface, encased in an exopolysaccharide matrix  The cyanobacterial strain Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803 is an example of a strain that may form a biofilm  Bacteria that form many biofilms are motile, and type IV pili are necessary for motility of Synechocystis 6803  In order to determine if biofilms could be induced in strain 6803, plates made with BG-11 medium were used to see if phototaxis, the movement towards light, would occur in the presence of a unidirectional light source  Cyanobacteria were also acid stressed to see if there would be aggregation along the side of the culture flasks to escape acid stress.

Sciences and Nancy H  Kolodny, Chemistry Under conditions of acid stress, cyanobacteria are able to maintain their internal pH at neutral levels as well as to raise the external pH to tolerable levels  Using 31P NMR spectroscopy, we generated inorganic phosphate (Pi) titration curves, providing a method to use the chemical shift of Pi to determine intracellular pH  The intracellular pH data obtained via 31P spectroscopy have confirmed the ability of Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803 both to maintain internal pH and to neutralize external pH  Using 23Na NMR spectroscopy, we will see whether this occurs in part due to a sodium-proton antiporter; current work has been focused on finding an appropriate buffer to use with our shift reagent, which distinguishes the intracellular and extracellular Na+ in the cell environment  We will then repeat the experiments using larger NMR tubes in order to have a more viable environment for the cells.

Islam is understood by its followers to be a religion of faith and equality  According to the Quran, all Muslims are equal and connected to each other as part of the Ummah (world body of Muslims)  In light of this concept, one would expect to see close interaction among Muslim immigrants in Europe  To test this assumption, I have studied the immigrant Muslim community in Lleida, Spain  The Muslims there are divided along cultural and ethnic lines: North African (Arab/Berber) and Sub-Saharan African (black)  My study analyzes why the Muslims in Lleida are living and worshipping in communities divided along cultural-ethnic lines  I have found that different cultural backgrounds, conflicting/dissimilar approaches to theology, and the Spanish communitys social perceptions of these groups foster the lack of unity between them despite their common faith.

Standardized tests have long since been a means of testing students ability to master material against pre-established norms  Since the Brown v  Board of Education decision, educational researchers have focused on examining why minorities continually score lower than their white counterparts on these tests  Access to academic course work is important because it affects student outcomes on assessments  For students who desire to attend college, access to Advanced Placement (AP) courses is crucial to their admission  Using national data, this presentation will show findings from my examination about how high schools students are distributed in AP courses in regard to race  I focus on how the location and academic environment of the school relates to student access to these courses  I will also present the relationship between access to AP courses and student achievement by comparing samples of high students using data from national longitudinal surveys and a Wellesley College first-year student survey.

Activated-Induced Manganese Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (AIM-MRI) is a technique that is used for functional MRI studies to measure activity in the nervous system  Manganese (II) is taken up preferentially by the nervous system because, like calcium (II), it is capable of selectively entering active neurons  Manganese (II) also enhances the contrast within MR images  AIM-MRI was applied to the crayfish visual and olfactory systems  Intermolt Procambarus clarkii were imaged multiple times after a MnCl2- saline intramuscular injection  Preliminary experiments demonstrated that signal intensities in the MR images plateau 40 minutes after injection, indicating that manganese accumulation within tissues was complete  Signal intensities within the accessory, olfactory, and antennary lobes in the brain in MR images were compared with and without a light or olfactory stimulus for any indication of preferential uptake by tissue due to the stimulus  This study provides the basic methods for future circadian rhythm and sensory experiments.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used to study neurologic diseases by providing quantitative information about concentrations of neurochemicals in the brain  We are using this technique to study Rett Syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects young girls  By analyzing the ratios of neurochemicals in a mouse model of RTT we hope to develop a more complete understanding of the nature of this disorder  The goal of this research is to analyze the effects of choline supplementation on brain chemistry to determine if choline can be a possible treatment for RTT  Lactating mice were given choline in their drinking water; nursing pups thus received choline through their mothers milk  These young mice were studied using ex vivo NMR spectroscopy to determine the effect of choline on their developing brains  Choline significantly increases the abnormally low concentration of N-acetylaspartate, an indicator of neuronal health, in RTT male mouse brains.

Neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, has been found in a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate animals  Neurogenesis in the brains of lobsters (Homarus americanus) and crayfish (Cherax destructor, Procambarus clarkii) is regulated by the day/night cycle  In these studies, we manipulate environmental light conditions and photoreceptors in order to learn more about how light regulates the production of new neurons and locomotory activity  We use two approaches to study the regulatory pathways: indirect interference through stroboscopic and constant light illumination and direct interference with the known photoreceptive systems  We present experimental results showing the effects of strobe and 24-hour light conditions on neurogenesis  We also introduce a new method of studying neurogenesis through the entrainment of locomotory activity patterns and photoreceptive systems of P  clarkii and C  destructor.

Participating in ongoing research efforts using bacterial strains isolated from a heavy metal contamination site (Paintshop Pond), we examined the potential correlation between heavy metal and antibiotic resistance  Previous studies suggest this resistance may be conferred by plasmidderived gene products  Genomic and plasmid DNA extraction and amplification, as well as chromium, lead and antibiotic sensitivity tests, allowed us to determine the presence of, and correlation between, these types of resistance in our bacterial isolates via constructed phylogenetic trees  In addition, by analyzing the effect of pH on the toxicity of these metals, we investigated the potential role of acid rain in altering bacterial resistance to heavy metals at contamination sites  This study provides a more accurate understanding of the true toxicity of this past pollution and its environmental implications.

Parasocial relationships, defined as the symbolic, one-sided quasi-relationships between a viewer and a mediated personality (Horton & Wohl, 1956), have gained a great deal of recent interest  Adolescent girls may be especially prone to forming these relationships with media figures  Research has shown that adolescent girls struggle with issues of self-esteem, depression, forming attachments, and creating a functional support system, indicating that they are a particularly vulnerable group  This study examines predictors of adolescent girls parasocial relationships with media figures in the context of normal development  Insecurely attached adolescent girls with lower self-esteem, less social support, and symptoms of depression are expected to form parasocial relationships more readily than others.

Convinced that states could reduce their welfare expenditures by making absent fathers into providers, President Clintons 1996 welfare reform legislation required states to increase paternity establishment and child-support enforcement by instituting new and improved mechanisms for tracking (mostly) unwed, noncustodial fathers  Under Reform, women whose children receive state benefits are required to subrogate their paternity-establishment and enforcement rights to the state, allowing Department of Revenue officials to bring absent fathers before the court in order to establish support orders and impose sanctions for noncompliance  This multiyear study collected data from three Massachusetts courthouses, offering almost 800 cases from which to draw conclusions about the current systems effectiveness in moving single mothers off of welfare  This presentation will address issues of enforcement, visitation, and the disparate treatment of men and women in court.

Do you feel like Wellesley is your home? This past year I have studied how first-year students develop a sense of belonging at Wellesley  Why are some students able to do this quickly and successfully, while others struggle to feel comfortable here? When and how are students able to strike a balance between course work, participating in extracurricular activities, and socializing with their friends? I considered these types of questions while taking part in discussions at first-year focus groups, examining survey data, and reading scholarly works on the first-year experience  My presentation will focus on what students learn about themselves in their first year, how they decide what is most important to them, and what goals they set for the years ahead.

Linguistic Sciences/French Wellesley College is a haven for linguistic research on bilingualism, and my thesis project examines the speech habits of the local Japanese-English bilingual population  Code-switching  the alternation between two languages in a conversation  is a linguistic phenomenon that occurs frequently within bilingual communities  Code-switching is governed by grammatical constraints and is also influenced by a variety of social factors, such as the participants of the conversation, the location, and the topic under discussion  In order to explore these areas, I recorded conversations of Wellesley College Japanese-English bilinguals and transcribed and analyzed their code-switches  I also constructed a grammatical quiz to test proficient bilinguals grammatical judgments of written code-switches  This presentation is an overview of the results I have obtained.

From 1997 to 2003, the Hubble Space Telescope observed the binary star system VV Cephei  This system consists of a small, hot B-type star orbiting a cool M supergiant star so large, that if placed in the center of our solar system, would stretch beyond the orbit of Jupiter  The M supergiant is further surrounded by an extensive gaseous envelope  Every 20 years, the hot component goes into eclipse behind the cool supergiant  As it emerges, its orbital motion can be used to probe the structure of the extended supergiant envelope  This envelope is produced by rapid mass loss in a stellar wind from the supergiant, which can be detected through narrow, blue-shifted absorption features in the observed spectra  I will present measurements of the velocity of this wind as determined from these features as observed in different positions within the stars orbits.

The importance of biomedical devices, with an estimated U S  market of over $5B per year, has created a need to control surface interactions, especially as these devices become smaller and capable of performing more functions  Biomaterials are synthetic or natural materials that interact with a biological system  Using functionalized nanoparticles to form a self-assembled monolayer on varying substrates, the adsorption of proteins and cells to surfaces can be controlled  The focus is on having surface coatings that prevent nonspecific adsorption of proteins  2-D and 3-D polymers are also studied  Thermoresponsive linear polymer chains are studied for use in surface modification of metals such as gold  Hydrogels are cross-linked polymer networks; here, hydrogels with temperature-dependent water interactions are investigated for use in drug delivery and environmental remediation.

Modernity is characterized by the rise in military technology and capacity for destruction as well as by the development of a human rights culture throughout the world  My study analyzes the ways in which the two trajectories have become increasingly interrelated in the Army through the development of human rights education in the military  The ongoing public debate regarding human rights abuses and torture by members of the U S  military make the exploration of the treatment of human rights in the military ultimately timely  Through on-site interviews with Army instructors, I explore how the unique elements of the institution of the Army, such as its strict adherence to hierarchy, affect the way in which human rights are taught by the Army  I also take up the question of how human rights are taught to military personnel in terms of the War on Terror.

1,2,4Triazolium salts have important applications as customizable ionic solvents  When the anion is varied, an unexpected dependence of the H5 resonance on the anion is observed in CDCl3, greater downfield shifts corresponding with increased anion basicity  It is proposed that this chemical shift results from hydrogen bonding between the anion and H5 in solution  HC correlated NMR spectra were generated for 1allyl4phenyl1,2,4triazolium bromide in CDCl3 at concentrations from 0 04M to 0 6M  As concentration increases, an upfield shift in H5 (12 612 2ppm) and a downfield shift in H3 (9 110ppm) is observed  A possible explanation for this shift is that as concentrations increase, hydrogen bonding to H3 becomes significant, attenuating the acidity of H5  X-ray crystallography of 1allyl4phenyl1,2,4triazolium iodide and 1benzyl4phenyl1,2,4triazolium chloride show the anion located near both H3 and H5 in hydrogen bonding positions  Further investigation includes more X-ray crystallography and computational models.

We have investigated the low-energy electron-induced chemistry of several condensed halomethanes (CF3I, CF2Cl2, and CCl4) as a function of incident electron energy and fluence  Our experimental procedure involves temperature programmed desorption experiments following low-energy (1  100 eV) electron irradiation of nanoscale thin films (< 10  thickness) of halomethane films grown at 100 K on a molybdenum single crystal in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber (p ~ 1  1010 Torr)  These studies serve to elucidate the pivotal role that low-energy electron-induced reactions play in high-energy radiation-induced chemical reactions in condensed matter  The studies may also provide information valuable to (a) furthering cost-efficient destruction of hazardous chemicals, (b) understanding the electron-induced decomposition of feed gases used in the plasma processing of semiconductor devices, (c) clarifying the role, if any, of low-energy electrons, produced by cosmic rays, interacting with CF2Cl2 and producing Cl atoms that contribute to the formation of the ozone hole, and (d) illuminating the dynamics of electron-induced oligomerization and/or polymerization.

Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC)  produced when atomic gases are cooled to near absolute zero  offer a macroscopic way to view the quantum mechanical world  In order to measure certain properties of these condensates, the cooled gas must be released from its potential trap and allowed to expand  Oftentimes an analytic solution for the time-evolution of the BEC wave-function after release from the trap cannot be found and a numerical solution is needed  By applying a recent numerical method for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, the time-evolution for BEC after release from potential traps of various geometries can be found  These numerical solutions can show interference effects when two condensates overlap, allowing a unique macroscopic observation of the quantum behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates.

A symbiotic star system consists of a small, hot star accreting material from a large, cooler companion star  For more than a decade, Wellesley professors and students have observed these stars using Wellesleys 24inch Sawyer telescope and analyzed their brightness fluctuations  To prepare the results of these observations for publication, I wrote a computer program to check observation dates among several databases and modified the analysis programs to be compatible with the way the CCD camera data is currently being read out  When we discovered that a limitation with the old configuration of the CCD camera might have caused errors in the results, I carried out a new observing program to assess the impact  Wellesleys observations will contribute to a growing body of knowledge about these fascinating star systems.

Nanoscale surface modification has potential for use in biomedical and marine applications including the mitigation of fouling, or adhesion of cells or organisms to a surface  In biomedical applications, cell or protein adhesion to an implantable device can impair proper device function  In marine environments, fouling of ships adds drag to the ship, thus increasing fuel consumption and green house gas emissions  To prevent fouling, surfaces can be coated with self-assembling thin films  We are examining the fundamental properties of thin films made from functionalized gold nanoparticles and polymers  The moderate to long-term stability of gold nanoparticle-based thin films and the thermo-responsive behavior of N-isopropylacrylamide-based polymers are being investigated  Gold nanoparticles are biocompatible and can also be used for the delivery of treatment to cells  Surface modification of gold nanoparticles with antibodies and a boron agent is being examined to develop a safe cancer treatment.

There are few excavations in the modern world that can shake the foundations of human evolutionary theory like Dmanisi, Georgia, the earliest hominid site outside Africa  There are also few processes more capable of interfering with the objective interpretation of excavation findings than national ideology  For this reason, an investigation into the reciprocal influence of nation building and paleoanthropology is an ethical necessity  Today the excavations constitute a significant component of Georgian cultural heritage (e g  Homo georgicus)  This presentation considers ethnic, political, and religious factors in Georgian national identity in order to evaluate the influence of national context on the scientific contributions of Dmanisi.

Under the British Mandate for Palestine, various groups competed for control of space and resources in Haifa, a port city in what is now Northern Israel  Unlike the other major cities in Palestine during the 1930s, Tel-Aviv-Jaffa and Jerusalem, Haifas residents led a more cosmopolitan life; Jews, Arabs, and a surprising number of other ethnic groups lived and worked together in the citys old quarters  But increasing Jewish immigration to Palestine and the advent of the British Mandate caused major shifts in Haifas structure  This project examines the process by which Haifas cosmopolitanism gave way to sectarian violence and increasing segregation, paying particular attention to competition for ownership of space within the city, and the discourses used to maintain this dominance.

In my paintings, I hope to draw attention to the questions and contradictions surrounding the female body  I am objecting to the objectification of the ideal female form  As a young woman in todays society, I witness the confusion all females experience in understanding, respecting, and accepting their unique bodies  We are bombarded with mixed messages about what the body should or should not be, learning of both obesity and eating disorders  Women are conditioned to see their imperfections as blemishes  I want to convey the beauty I perceive in my models to urge them to appreciate, accept, and love their bodies  I am attempting to defy the conventional nude, where I am not painting their bodies for the viewers visual consumption, but for my models  When I study my subject, the shapes, shadows, light, and forms become an object of true beauty.

We are investigating the deficiencies in the insulin-induction pathway in type II diabetes mellitus  In a normal insulin-producing pathway, food enters the intestine and stimulates the production of small molecule GLP1  GLP1 then travels to the pancreas where it stimulates its receptor and results in the production of insulin  Insulin allows cells of the body to uptake glucose, whose metabolism provides the cells with the energy required to run the body  Type II diabetics show resistance to the level of insulin their body naturally produces  Our projects aim to determine the molecular mechanisms of the interactions of GLP1 and its receptor in the insulin-induction pathway in hopes of developing a more efficient therapeutic treatment for type II diabetes mellitus.

Lead poisoning is the most common environmental disease that affects children in the United States, and it is entirely preventable  Environmental diseases disproportionately affect urban, poor, and minority communities, and this study seeks to address the lead contamination in Roxbury and Dorchester, MA  This study evaluated the complete urban lifecycle of lead with the goal of reducing exposure to residents who use their contaminated backyard gardens to grow produce necessary for their food security  One hundred and forty-one backyard gardens were tested and 81% had lead levels above the EPA action limit  It was determined that lead originated from lead-based paint and leaded gasoline emissions  This study quantified the input of lead to the human system from four major pathways of exposure (see figure)  Remediation options were also tested and are currently being implemented on a large scale with the goal of preserving environmental and public health.

The mine waste (chat) piles at the Tar Creek Superfund Site in northeast Oklahoma have elevated concentrations of Pb, Zn, and Cd and are a major source of metal contamination to the area  Runoff from these piles, acid mine drainage from underground mines, and leaching from chat within the streambed contribute to metal loading into Tar Creek, a principal drainage system of the Superfund Site, and this ultimately into the Neosho River, a serious concern for the public and ecosystem health of the area  This research aims to identify the processes that control the transport of these metals within Tar Creek and downstream Neosho River, the extent of that transport, and the level of contamination  Using x-ray fluorescence and x-ray diffraction techniques on river sediments, it attempts to read the geochemical fingerprint of the areas recent history.

Green roofs, also known as vegetated or eco-roofs, are desirable for their various environmental benefits, including improved air quality, increased habitat area and preservation of biodiversity  Because little is known about green roofs in North America, this study looked at the success rates and physiological responses of native plant species growing under rooftop conditions  We chose 28 plant species native to the Northeast region, from herbaceous to woody plants and grasses, and cultivated them on the green roof atop the water treatment vault  All species survived the establishment period in this challenging growing environment and in the adjacent garden  Leaf size, plant stress, and biomass data revealed interesting plant acclimation strategies for life on a roof.

The popularity of organic gardening is increasing, as this method of horticulture is healthy for both plants and humans  The Margaret Ferguson Greenhouse at Wellesley College uses both organic and chemical methods to control pests and promote overall plant health  The goal of my experiment was to determine which process was best for one species (Calendula officianalis) that, like many plants grown quickly for greenhouse display, is a magnet for pests  Calendulas were grown using different soil treatments consisting of compost, worm castings, and synthetic vs  organic fertilizer  Bloom counts measured which plants were best aesthetically and insects were monitored to determine which treatment was most pest resistant  A Chlorophyll A-Fluorometer ascertained plant stress and the shoot biomass demonstrated which treatment harbored the best growth  Recognizing the best soil conditions for this plant will help determine the extent to which future horticultural displays can be produced organically.

The availability of clean freshwater is an issue of global significance  The depletion of this vital resource due to heavy metal contamination poses serious problems not only to the environment, but also to human health  The green alga Clamydomonas reinhardtii has been shown to accumulate a variety of heavy metals and, thus, has the potential to be a successful tool for removing toxic heavy metals from freshwater ecosystems  The goals of this work are two fold: to study the interactions between lead(II) and Chlamydomonas and to create a novel method of in situ bioremediation using Chlamydomonas immobilized in alginate hydrogel beads  Any natural process that can be used to alleviate the current pollution of our freshwater resources with minimal impact to aquatic ecosystems should be more understood and this research is the first step in doing so.

Most American parents do not live with the fear that one day their parental rights will be terminated  Yet incarcerated mothers live with that fear daily  U S  laws and their related policies and practices regarding termination of parental rights uniquely and unjustly impact incarcerated mothers causing them to be at high risk for losing their parental rights  Ideals and concepts about motherhood, criminality, race and class drive these laws and practices  My thesis argues that these ideals and concepts contribute to unjust parental right terminations for incarcerated mothers, thereby traumatizing the mothers and children involved  I offer a rethinking of those ideals and concepts and recommend alternative programs and policies that would minimize unjust parental right terminations for incarcerated mothers.

The Open Circle Program at the Wellesley Centers for Women promotes social and emotional learning in elementary schools  By training school teachers to implement its high-quality curriculum and approach, the Open Circle program helps children develop effective communication, impulse control and problem-solving skills and fosters caring classroom communities  Although teachers are the facilitators for the Open Circle program in their classrooms, school principals are key decision makers in the implementation of any school activity and, therefore, play an important role in the success of programs like Open Circle  The project administered an online survey to 407 principals in schools that had been involved with Open Circle  The survey assessed principals level of knowledge, level of use, and perceived value of the program as well as inviting suggestions for Open Circle to consider  Results of this investigation aim to guide future development of Open Circles programs.

This study examined the relationship between body image and two faces of narcissism: overt or grandiosity-exhibitionism and covert or vulnerability-sensitivity  Narcissistic individuals include people whose lives focus on issues of self-definition, self-worth, identity, and autonomy  In its broadest interpretation, narcissism can be characterized as self-investment  In its most adaptive form, this self-investment serves to enhance psychological wellbeing and promote positive feelings about oneself  In its maladaptive form, narcissistic individuals are most often characterized by negative behaviors such as exaggerated self-entitlement, exploitation, and grandiosity  One hundred and ninety Wellesley students completed multiple measures of narcissism and body image  Results are expected to demonstrate a positive correlation between body image and overt narcissism and a negative correlation between body image and covert narcissism.

The equity in their home is the largest asset in the portfolio of the vast majority of households  During the last 12 years, home prices have more than tripled  They are now falling  A continuing downturn in the housing market could have serious consequences for households and for the underlying economy  Strong evidence suggests that consumer spending by households responds to changes in wealth, including housing wealth  Furthermore, any drop in construction can have a direct effect on GDP growth  Finally, a sharp decline in prices would be likely to cause a rise in mortgage loan defaults and foreclosures and could cause serious problems for financial markets  This thesis is designed to shed light on two important aspects of price determination in the recent downturn: demographics and psychology  To do so, I sent out 1,000 surveys to a randomly selected sample of buyers and sellers in the Boston housing market during the time of the recent slowdown.

Medicare Part D, the new prescription drug benefit program which started in January 2006, represents the single most significant expansion of public insurance programs in the U S  in the past 40 years  To date, it offers subsidized drug coverage to 22 5 million seniors  The government delegated the delivery of the drug benefit to private insurers, arguing that market competition will help to drive prices down  Initially, there was concern that some states would not have enough plans supplied in order to ensure a competitive environment  But the opposite has happened, the set of possible options was wide ranging: in some cases people had to choose between more than 50 different plan options, with varying coverage benefits  Given the limited information available to the patients and the uncertainty inherent in this kind of decision, my project uses discrete choice models to analyze how people made choices from among these myriad programs.

The architectural competition for the design and masterplan of the new Palais de Justice in Paris took place early in the fall of 2006  This competition entailed the redesign of a previously industrial area in the thirteenth arrondissement in Paris  The site, across from Perraults famous Bibliothque Nationale, would have to fit into the overall development plan for the entire neighbourhood as a mixed-use development zone, within which a design for the new Parisian courthouse had to be situated  Entering this competition as an independent study, we thought it would be an opportunity to gain experience in the field of architecture  The entire proposal from the urban macrocosm to the courthouse microcosm was defined by a simple curve centered at the plaza of the Bibliothque Nationale  Our project was about synthesizing the new with the old and allowing a palimpsest of the sites previous industrial legacy to remain.

Science and Leslie Kaelbling (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT) Performing a task in a complex world requires learning planning rules  These rules predict the result of actions performed in terms of some ontology, which may itself be learned from world stimuli  My thesis examines how representations of world stimuli can affect the learned ontology, which can in turn influence the quality of the planning rules  I consider how one might learn the definition of the primitive predicate on in a 3D world of blocks, where the task is to build stacks of blocks  I study the role of visual information in determining whether an on relationship exists, using machine learning algorithms to learn the definition of on given training data from a perceptual study  I then use the definitions learned from different feature subsets to learn planning rules  The usefulness of these planning rules will determine the quality of each definition, and the relevance of the visual features used.

Are bilinguals simply two monolinguals in one person, or is the interaction between their two languages more complicated than that? My study addresses this question from the perspective of syntax, the arrangement of words to form sentences  Researchers of Spanish/English and German/English bilinguals found that hearing a sentence with a given syntactic structure in Spanish or German can encourage the use of the same syntactic structure in a subsequent English sentence  These results suggest that certain aspects of syntax can be shared between a bilinguals languages  My study attempts to replicate these findings in Russian-English bilinguals  In addition, while previous studies have examined bilinguals as a single group, my study compares early bilinguals, who grew up speaking two languages, to late bilinguals, who learned their second language after puberty  Such a comparison will shed light on whether different types of bilinguals organize the syntax of their two languages differently.

Co-crystals are crystals that contain two different compounds held together in the tight packing of the crystal lattice  Previous research has developed many co-crystals that exhibit saturated hydrogen bonding, including those of 1,4phenylenediamine (PDA) and several diols  Such structures have not yet been found for the corresponding dithiols, however  Dithioldiamine co-crystals are expected to exhibit saturated hydrogen bonding  This research project has focused on the formation of such co-crystals between PDA and 1,4benzenedithiol, as well as several aliphatic dithiols  Information will be presented about the structure and properties of co-crystals that have been formed during the course of the research project.

Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is a soluble metalloendopeptidase that has been isolated in a variety of cell types, such as brain, pituitary, and the testes  TOP metabolizes a variety of bioactive peptides and is implicated in the regulation of many physiological processes  Results from several laboratories, including our own, suggest that TOP can metabolize an unusually wide range of substrates due to flexibility of a loop opposite the binding pocket  For this study, we have conducted kinetic assays in the presence of reagents that induce flexibility or rigidity  We have examined activity of TOP towards substrates of different sizes, and have engineered the enzyme itself for decreased flexibility  Our data show that increasing rigidity improves the activity of TOP towards a small substrate whereas increasing flexibility enhances the activity of TOP towards a larger substrate.

Under conditions of acid stress, cyanobacteria are able to maintain their internal pH at neutral levels as well as to raise the external pH to tolerable levels  Using 31P NMR spectroscopy, we generated inorganic phosphate (Pi) titration curves, providing a method to use the chemical shift of Pi to determine intracellular pH  The intracellular pH data obtained via 31P spectroscopy have confirmed the ability of Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803 both to maintain internal pH and to neutralize external pH  Using 23Na NMR spectroscopy, future experiments will determine whether this occurs in part due to a sodium-proton antiporter  Current work has been focused on performing viability experiments using live-dead staining and fluorescence spectroscopy to examine cells under standard NMR conditions and more optimal conditions using larger NMR tubes with light and carbon dioxide bubbling.

Cyanobacteria, this planets oldest known organisms, are photosynthetic bacteria important in maintaining oxygen in the earths atmosphere  They are alkaliphilic and have been shown to increase the pH of their environment via several postulated means, including amino acid decarboxylation, when placed in acidic media  Amino acid decarboxylases are enzymes that catalyze the reaction in which a carboxyl group is removed from amino acids as carbon dioxide  Secretion of the resulting highly basic amine will raise the pH of the environment  We are using a carbon dioxide assay for decarboxylase activity and Western Blot analysis for decarboxylase synthesis in order to determine whether increased activity and/or increased synthesis of amino acid decarboxylases are part of the acid stress response of cyanobacteria  Current data have shown both increased decarboxylase activity and increased decarboxylase synthesis in acid stressed bacteria, suggesting that amino acid decarboxylation is involved in the acid stress response of cyanobacteria.

Antimicrobial peptides are short proteins that are produced by a wide variety of  organisms to kill bacteria and other microbial cells  Buforin II, a 21amino acid peptide isolated from the stomach of the Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans, is one such peptide, which enters its target cells and destroys them through subsequent binding to DNA  Our research focuses on how buforin II interacts with these lipid membranes  We examined the interaction of buforin II with lipid membranes of varying chemical characteristics and concentrations  Previous work in the Elmore lab has considered interactions with membranes consisting of only phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol  However, our studies include two additional lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, which allows us to study how buforin II interacts with more physiologically relevant membranes  By analyzing these interactions, we hope to further elucidate the mechanism by which buforin interacts with and enters cells.

In addition to the complex immune system that organisms employ to deal with foreign objects and diseases, a more basic form of host defense consists of small antimicrobial peptides  One such peptide, buforin II, a more potent form of the buforin I peptide isolated from the Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans, enters the cell via formation of pores in the cell membrane  In order to better understand the membrane translocation mechanism of buforin II on a molecular level, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of buforin II-lipid membrane interactions using GROMACS  By applying a transmembrane potential, we have biased the entry of buforin into the membrane on the simulation timescale  In an age where bacterial resistance to drugs and antibiotics increases rampantly, studying antimicrobial peptides is important as they demonstrate promise as novel therapeutic agents, possessing a broad range of activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses, and even cancerous cells.

The steroid hormone, progesterone, acts in the brain to influence a variety of events, including female reproduction in rodents  Progesterone elicits many of its biological effects by binding to intracellular progestin receptors (PR) in specific brain regions  PR is expressed as two molecular forms from the same gene, full length PRB and the truncated PRA  My research involves developing Western blots for PR in the rat brain and uterus, a technique to determine PR protein expression  Recently, our lab has explored protein-protein interactions to determine other proteins, or coactivators, that are necessary for hormone-dependent gene expression  My project will extend this work to PR action in the brain  We hope to identify new coactivators that participate in hormone action in the brain and uterus  Further knowledge of hormone action may increase our understanding of mechanisms connected to hormone dependent diseases, such as uterine and breast cancer.

Compared to other vertebrates, goldfish (Carassius auratus) are unique in their capacity to endure for up to five days with no environmental oxygen  Previous data from our laboratory suggest that the activation of specific ion channels is one factor that helps to protect vulnerable tissues under low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions  Hypoxia-induced activation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the heart, for example, may serve to increase tolerance of low oxygen  The purpose of this study was to resolve the mechanism by which this channel is activated when oxygen levels are low, and, specifically, to assess the role of nitric oxide (NO)-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (GC) and protein kinase G (PKG) in channel opening  Our data suggest that increased activity of GC is involved in the opening of KATP channels, but that this response is independent of PKG.

Throughout centuries of military and political rivalry, France has served as mirror, model, and challenge to English self-perception  During the early years of the twentieth century, however, the Entente Cordiale enabled the nascent development of a deep and enduring political alliance  In a reflection of political change, this climate of friendship before the First World War facilitated the burgeoning of the contemporary relationship between the English and the French publics  Drawing upon original research from a wide variety of sources, this talk will address the effects of this new political reality on popular English perceptions of their old rivals across the Channel, focusing on the prominent themes of politics, art, and culture  In addition, I aim to show how shifts in perceptions of France reflected Edwardian Englands changing conceptions of its own national identity.

Many important economic phenomena are modeled as coordination games  For example, bank runs and currency crises can be modeled as coordination games with incomplete information about payoffs; this type of game is referred to as a global game  Most of the existing work on global games is theoretical and few experimental results have been reported  I designed an experiment to test whether players perform as the theory predicts in a 2x2 global game and to determine whether behavior converges to the complete information equilibrium  The experiment results show that the mere existence of uncertainty regarding payoffs has an enormous impact on player behavior and that player behavior does not conform to the theoretical prediction  I propose several explanations for the observed behavior  Because the 2x2 game serves as the most basic model of the generalized multiperson global game, the experimental results have important implications for building financial models.

As students, the term artist possessed a mysterious appeal and allurement, one which we would not fully comprehend until we attempted to become artists ourselves  Would our lives become intertwined with our artwork? Would we see the world only through shades of blue? Our thesis projects became the culmination of our exposure to studying and making art  Creating art requires reflection, contextual awareness, and discipline  Our yearlong thesis projects gave us the opportunity to explore a subject matter of immense personal interest  Through the different media of film, installation, painting, printmaking, and sculpture, we were each challenged to convey our conceptual ideas into a physical body of work  A prelude to our thesis exhibit will be on display in the Jewett Gallery  In this panel, we will discuss our experiences, navigating between being a Wellesley student and an artist.

To validate the use of Mn2+ as a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements of neural activity in crustaceans, an extracellular contrast agent, Magnevist, was administered to Cherax destructor  Differences between the MR images obtained using the two contrast agents demonstrated the selectivity of Mn2+ for neural tissues  Extracellular recording of the crayfish optic nerve was employed to ascertain the optimum intensity of light needed to produce a significant photoreceptor response  The resulting data aided in the production of a light source that best stimulated the crayfish visual system  MR images were then obtained using MEMRI, and the signal intensities of the neurons within the visual system were compared with and without stimulation by the light source.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance  (1H NMR) spectroscopy can be used to study neurologic diseases, such as a mouse model for Rett Syndrome (RTT), by providing quantitative information about the concentrations of neurochemicals in the brain  One goal of this research is to analyze the effects of choline supplementation on brain neurochemistry to determine if choline can be a possible treatment for RTT  Metabolite concentrations were measured using ex vivo NMR spectroscopy to determine cholines effect on the developing brains  The second goal is to generate a developmental metabolic profile of RTT using in vivo spectroscopy in conjunction with MR imaging  As a pilot study, Wellesleys micro-MRI system has been used to longitudinally monitor whole brain development and regional brain metabolite concentrations at PD (postnatal day) 21/22, PD 35/36, and PD 42/43 in wild-type mice.

The MDEFT pulse sequence in MRI is a very fast imaging technique which gives three-dimensional images of the whole brain in a very short time  This technique is very useful as the images obtained using MDEFT have a better signal-to-noise ratio as well as improved contrast  The goal of this study is to change and streamline the parameters of the MDEFT pulse sequence to obtain better images in ongoing mouse and crayfish studies using the micro-MRI system at Wellesley College and to make the images less sensitive to inhomogeneity of the magnetic field  Another goal of this study is to design a surface coil resonating at 400MHz which would allow us to receive signals only from the regions of interest in the MRI, thus leading to higher resolution images.

Patients with Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder, exhibit smaller brain volumes than controls  We monitored brain growth in Mecp21lox mice, an animal model of RTT, by identifying the time-points at which brain development in RTT mice diverges from normal mice  Micro-MRI was used to monitor the volume of the whole brain, cerebellum, and motor cortex in this mouse model from postnatal day 17 to 41  Significant differences in whole brain and regional structures have been found between Mecp21lox and wild-type mice  To improve delineation of brain structures and perform function studies on mouse models for diseases such as RTT, manganese-enhanced MRI is being developed  Delivery of the manganese through intraperitoneal injections was attempted to determine viable concentrations of the contrast agent and to monitor any behavioral or physical changes resulting from the injections  The manganese accumulated in the hippocampus and differences in intensities from other regions were determined using MRI.

The purpose of our study is to explore the various factors that influence adult neurogenesis in crustaceans, including crayfish (Cherax destructor) and lobsters (Homarus Americanus)  By incubating the animals in a thymidine analog, BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine), we are able to track the birth of new neurons  BrdU is taken up in the S-phase of cell division and can be tagged with a series of antibodies using immunocytochemical techniques  The secondary antibody has a fluorescent tag that can be seen using the confocal microscope, which allows us to measure the extent of neurogenesis  In this experiment, we ablate one of the two olfactory organs (antennules) and monitor the effect on neurogenesis due to the loss of sensory input and increases in levels of nitric oxide in neural pathways ipsilateral to ablation   Students Colleen Kirkhart 09 and Rosa Lafer-Sousa 09 also participated in this study.

Circadian rhythms are endogenous cycles of activities oriented around a 24hour period  This study is testing the relationship between locomotory rhythms and levels of Pigment Dispersing Hormone (PDH) in neurons and synaptic areas of the crayfish Procambaraus clarkii and Cherax destructor  In previous studies, P  clarkii shows a locomotory rhythm in constant dark conditions (D/D) reminiscent of that present in 12hr light/12hr dark (L/D), suggesting that locomotion is driven by an endogenous circadian clock  In contrast, C  destructor is arrhythmic in D/D despite having a locomotory rhythm entrained to a 24hr clock while in L/D conditions  In this species, in L/D conditions, PDH levels cycle over a 24hour period in specific neurons and synaptic brain regions  These data suggest that PDH may be an output of the endogenous clock  An assessment of PDH levels in parallel with locomotory rhythms will allow us to determine if there is a tight relationship between these and the endogenous clock.

As much as ten percent of Sri Lankas working-age women are presently employed in the Middle East as migrant domestic workers  Media reports highlighting the various abuses faced by some of these women have led to widespread controversy over whether the Sri Lankan government should continue to encourage female migration for unskilled work abroad  Do these women choose migration, despite the perceived risks, because it is the best option available to them under given circumstances, or because they have poor access to accurate information about job opportunities, both at home and abroad, and thus have a misguided perception of migration? Based on interviews and household surveys conducted among returned and potential migrants in one district of Sri Lanka, I will examine the socioeconomic impact of female migration at the micro level, and assess how temporary female migration has shaped rural households, for better or for worse.

Africana Studies and Selwyn Cudjoe, Africana Studies Whether in cinema houses, in neighborhood/quartier video dens, or watching television at home, Africans are bombarded daily with thousands of foreign images  This conspicuous consumption is of concern in light of the crucial role that the moving image can play in shaping identities, providing social commentary, and creating jobs and other avenues of economic growth  This study analyzes the historical, social, economic, and political forces and structures that have reinforced the colonization of the screen in Senegal, a nation that once showed enormous promise in film production in the decade following independence  To what extent have French support, currency devaluation, and IMF Structural Adjustment Programs been used as indirect tools of industry intervention? Emphasized in this study as harbinger to change in the future is the emerging digital trend being adopted by younger filmmakers and the new possibilities created by its decentralization of knowledge and opportunity.

For lawyers, there is no hierarchy of international crimes; war crimes and genocide are on the same level  For human rights scholars however, genocide is the crime of crimes; it is particularly reprehensible because it entails not only the destruction of a people, but the intent to destroy because of victims membership in a certain group  I explore the changing conception of genocide within the context of the International Criminal Tribunal of the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), focusing on how genocide is differentially defined and utilized by human rights scholars and lawyers  Analysis of ICTY genocide cases, scholarly writings on human rights, and interviews with ICTY prosecutors will reveal the current status of genocide as a moral and legal category  Additionally, my thesis examines the moral compromises inherent in prosecution of gross human rights violations.

Increasingly, rather than rely on face-to-face interactions to form and maintain romantic relationships, people use the Internet  Are particular personality traits related to a high frequency of Internet-mediated communication with ones significant other? This study examined the relationship between Internet-mediated communication in romantic relationships and shyness, introversion, self-presentation, and related personality traits  I administered a survey to female undergraduates to assess Internet use, personality variables, and attitudes about romantic relationships  I analyzed participant data based on shyness and introversion levels  I expected that highly shy, introverted participants would use the Internet to mediate romantic relationships with more frequency than extraverted, non shy participants, with other variables qualifying this main hypothesis.

The researcher examined the relationships among self-determination, flow, and creativity  Students of the visual arts were asked to complete measures of general openness to experience and self-regulation  Participants were also asked to complete measures of intrinsic motivation and flow immediately following sessions in which they were engaged in the creative process  The products resulting from these sessions were then rated by independent judges for creativity  Results were expected to show that flow is most often accompanied by high levels of intrinsic motivation and creativity, and that individuals with high levels of openness to experience and high intrinsic motivation tend to be more creative.

Film festivals have fascinated me since my high school involvement with the San Francisco International Film Festival  I have explored this interest during college by going to the festivals at Cannes and Telluride through various academic programs  With the ambition of attending the Sundance Film Festival, Americas preeminent showcase for independent cinema, I decided to conduct an independent study on the evolution and significance of this integral aspect of the film industry  After considering the major festivals of Europe (Cannes, Berlin, Venice), I narrowed my course of study to solely focus on Sundance  In just 20 years, this Utah event has changed the face of film production and distribution  My research was consummated at Sundance, where I drew my own conclusions about the genre the festival has spawned and its permanent effects, both positive and negative, on the international film community.

This research is the most recent work in my ongoing study of identity and society in literature  After writing on the stigma of the lisp and compiling materials for Professor Luther T  Tylers current course on Tennessee Williams and Truman Capotes flamboyant public identities,  I undertook an independent study of how both William Faulkner and Zora Neale Hurston took on the theme of community infrastructure in their novels  Light in August and Their Eyes Were Watching God present very distinct protagonists, Joe Christmas and Janie Starks, who, through discovery of their identity and voice, seek to define themselves as people and find an accepting community  However, after both characters have perpetrated acts of murder, it is Janies ability to appeal to her community that saves her while Joes inability to articulate himself leads to his graphic lynching.

Hydrogels are novel polymeric materials that can be synthesized for many purposes  Hydrogels swell in water and can be forced to contract and go through a phase transition under certain conditions, making them useful for carrying other materials, like small molecules, metal ions, and metal nanoparticles  The materials used in hydrogel synthesis strongly influence the gels behavior and ability to interact with other materials  Students will present work focused on using these gels in two different areas  Neutral and charged hydrogels have been studied for their ability (1) to load and release molecules of interest into solution and (2) to remove gold nanoparticles and copper ions from solution  The preparation and properties of the hydrogels used will also be examined.

Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a mutation in the X-linked gene for methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2)  Among the numerous autistic-like symptoms that affect RTT patients, breathing abnormalities are among the most severe, eventually causing death by respiratory arrest in up to 26% of patients  My investigation examines the structural basis for these respiratory symptoms in a MeCP2 knockout mouse model through a histological quantification of pulmonary cell morphology and an immunofluorescence protocol designed to determine the cellular localization of MeCP2 in the mouse lung  The findings of this study will help to elucidate the pathology of breathing abnormalities in RTT patients and could contribute to the development of new therapies that target the structural basis of these symptoms.

Buforin II is a 21amino acid cationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from the stomach tissue of Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans in 1996  It is hypothesized to target bacteria nonspecifically by crossing biological membranes without membrane permeabilization and binding to DNA  My research focuses on how lipid composition affects membrane binding and translocation of buforin II  The experiments performed utilize lipid vesicles as a model for biological membranes  To this end, I have used a fluorescence titration method to measure the binding of buforin II to lipid vesicles with varying compositions of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine, a negatively charged and neutral lipid  Current results suggest that the binding strength between buforin II and the lipid vesicles increases as the amount of negatively charged lipids increase  I have also adapted a biotin-avidin based protocol to measure buforin II translocation, across lipid vesicles of varying composition.

The Lin12/Notch Repeat (LNR) module is a small disulfide-rich protein module of 35 residues first identified in Notch receptors, which are proteins involved in controlling cellular differentiation in multicellular animals  The structural importance of the three tandem LNR modules in Notch function is revealed by recent structural data from the extracellular domain of human Notch2  Based on sequence alignments and preliminary biochemical information, LNR repeats are predicted to be also present in PAPP and Stealth proteins  Selective Ca2+ binding and a unique disulfide bonding pattern are critical for the correct folding of the prototype LNR module and are thereby suggested to be the determining features of an LNR module  This work focuses on producing and purifying the first LNR module form Notch1 and Notch2 using a bacterial expression system in preparation for studies to determine the binding affinities of various divalent atoms for these modules.

In developing countries, programs designed to improve child nutrition are widespread  The ability of such programs to improve the nutrition of individual children depends on how households choose to allocate resources among their members  If one child in a family is given a free meal in school, her parents might transfer some household food to other members of the family, such as her siblings  This implies that policies that target specific individuals in a household may be mostly neutralized by reallocations of the resource away from the child  On the other hand, the transfer may not be reallocated away, a phenomenon referred to as the intra-household flypaper effect because the transfer sticks to the child  This project seeks to explore the flypaper effect using data from a nutrition intervention in rural Guatemala from 1969 to 1977.

Foreign aid in Africa is a subject that in recent years, with an increasing number of initiatives, has moved to the forefront of global forums  However, foreign aid is not new; aid and promises of aid have always made the headlines in African countries  But is there sufficient change? Is aid for or against the common man/woman? And if not, where is the problem? Is it being addressed? Are there any alternative routes to facilitate change? Using HIV/AIDS and malaria as case studies, my research tries to tackle these questions by studying the impact of foreign aid on Tanzanias health policy  I take a close look at the nature and structure of aid delivery, including the trends over the years, its conditionality, its administration, and its influence on the quality of the health system, and consequently the larger population.

Alban Berg is a member of the Second Viennese School, a group of composers that included Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern  This school developed new musical languages of atonality and the twelve-tone method  Although Berg composed few pieces in his lifetime, his Violin Concerto (1935) is the most well known and often performed  The concerto was commissioned by the violinist Louis Krasner (1903-1995) and written in memory of Manon Gropius, the daughter of Alma Mahler  Since the Violin Concerto was Bergs last completed work and has many personal references, including numerology and secret messages, it is also seen as Bergs own requiem  This concerto is the subject of my music performance thesis  I explore Bergs score markings, language, and musical style to show how the seamless incorporation of these musical and symbolic elements contributes to the unique position this concerto holds within the concerto repertoire for the twenty-first century violinist.

Germany, Israel, and the United States have all incorporated the memory of World War II and the Holocaust into their respective national identities in very different ways  As a result, the memorials and museums that have been built in these nations, specifically the Holocaust-Mahnmal in Germany, Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D C , reflect changing perceptions of the war and these nations relationships to it  An examination of the architecture and exhibition materials, as well as of the debates surrounding the location, design, and character of the memorials form the core of this project.

This panel presentation will discuss student work addressing the major topics in neurogenesis research and their applications to human health  We will present studies on the genesis and growth of new neurons in the adult brain  Beyond the endogenous regulation of neurogenesis, environmental factors have an enormous impact on the growth of new neurons and their functionality  Effects of photoperiod and temperature on neurogenesis will be reported  Another topic of great interest in neuroscience has been how prescribed medications impact neurogenesis  Given that depression has been linked to low levels of adult neurogenesis, we will report results of research on how lithium, a common mood stabilizer, affects neuronal proliferation  Similarly, the results of a study completed in connection with MGH examining the effects of multiple commonly prescribed antidepressants on neurogenesis in crayfish will be discussed including the implications these findings may have for improving depression treatments.

According to the World Conservation Union, 23 percent of mammal species,  33 percent of amphibian species, and  12 percent of bird species are threatened with extinction  Now more than ever, states are confronted with the challenge of determining the best way to legally protect declining species populations  How do states choose among the various international species conservation mechanisms? In what ways do international measures protecting endangered species intersect? What are the implications?.

The interaction between high-energy radiation and matter produces copious amounts of secondary low-energy electrons that, through inelastic collisions with molecules and atoms, produce distinct energetic species that drive a wide variety of radiation-induced reactions  Our research serves to elucidate the pivotal role that these low-energy electron-induced reactions play in high-energy radiation-induced chemical reactions in condensed matter  For example, cosmic rays produce low-energy electrons that, through interactions with CF2Cl2, produce Cl atoms that may con-tribute to the formation of the ozone hole  We conjecture that low-energy electrons also play a pivotal role in biology based on a recent claim that the cyclic variation of extra-galactic cosmic ray flux may help explain cycles of biodiversity on earth  Low-energy electron-induced reaction studies such as ours also have important implications for industry, including the cost-efficient destruction of hazardous materials and the electron-induced decomposition of feed gases used in the plasma processing of semiconductor devices.

Estradiol (E) and progesterone (P) act in the brain to profoundly influence a variety of events, including cognition and reproductive behavior  These hormones carry out their physiologic effects by binding to their receptors, the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progestin receptor (PR), each of which is expressed as two distinct isoforms  Previous research has shown that coactivators, including Steroid Receptor Coactivator-2 (SRC-2), physically interact with ER and PR to facilitate transcription of target genes  In this study, pull-down assays were performed to determine if SRC-2 from rat brain interacts with the isoforms of ER and PR under various ligand conditions  Results show preferential inter-actions between SRC-2 and certain receptor isoforms, indicating that the receptor isoforms have different functions in brain  These findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of how hormones function in brain to regulate hormone-dependent gene expression and behavior.

The immune system operates mainly through T cells and B cells to fight off foreign invaders, called antigens, that gain access to the body  T cells originate in the bone marrow as stem cells and migrate to the thymus, where they differentiate into different types of T cells  They then leave the thymus as nave T cells and circulate in the blood and secondary lymphoid organs searching for antigen presentation by professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DC)  At the onset of this initial T cell-DC interaction there are three phases, each characterized with a specific T cell-DC interaction duration  In this study, we have looked at the significance of phase II, characterized by the stable interaction between T cells and DCs.

Governments have used gender quotas to bring women into politics, which remains a largely male-dominated enterprise around the world  The belief that gender functions as a criteria for representation drives this initiative  But the question remains: Do women in politics represent other women? While gender quotas might lead to an increased presence of women in politics, these quotas do not necessarily ensure a political culture wherein women can represent other women substantively  In Pakistan, the government has reserved a substantial percentage of seats for women in local, provincial, and national-level representative bodies  But the institutionalized culture of patriarchy in politics poses an obstacle to women elected through quotas to performing their role as representatives.

Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England witnessed the birth of a government shockingly similar to a modern welfare state, complete with community- owned industries, food and cash handouts and administrators  These innovative developments sought to address a crisis of poverty that jeopardized the common-wealth  However, assistance was only extended to those whose deprivation was unavoidable  the aged, the sick and the widowed  known as the worthy poor  Those judged to be the unworthy poor, the willingly impoverished, faced harsh measures intended to create productive laborers: whippings, brandings, enslavement, forced apprenticeship, mutilation and jailing  The looming catastrophe of the rootless, destitute masses served as the crucible that forged many of our contemporary notions of povertys origins and the appropriate role of the state in its citizens economic affairs and daily lives  These early modern debates therefore speak to many of our own contemporary dialogues.

Mormonism is the third fastest growing religion in the world  From a small sect founded in upstate New York in 1830, it has grown into a huge movement, with close to 13 million members  Yet for over half its history, the Church denied full membership to its Black members  Not until 1978 were African Americans allowed to participate fully in the Church  My study, based on interviews with church members in Massachusetts and New York, examines how the more than 100,000 Black Mormons negotiate their voluntary minority status  I examine how these individuals make sense of their racial and religious identities and how they interact with each other.

As recent headlines have made painfully evident, the subprime crisis has taken a considerable toll on financial markets  As a result of mortgage institutions lax lending practices and other factors, investors appear to have underestimated the risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities (MBS)  In a short period of time, risk was repriced across the board and liquidity for mortgage-backed securities dried up as they lost their appeal for investors  Like many other financial crises such as bank runs, currency crises, and debt crises, the subprime meltdown can be analyzed using a global-games framework where the con-sequences of an individuals actions depends on what others do  In my presentation, I will be looking into how recent advances in models of global games with heterogeneous information and investment complementarities can help us explain investors behavior during the subprime meltdown.

American law, originally adapted from English common law, has evolved to meet the unique and changing needs of American society  A topic of recent debate among economists is the importance of a countrys legal origins for its subsequent financial development and economic growth  In 1822, the New York legislature copied French civil law when it introduced a new business form, the limited partner-ship, into the United States  The limited partnership differed from the general partnership in offering limited liability to one or more special partners, who supplied capital but did not participate in managing the business venture  In my thesis, I examine how businessmen used the limited-partnership form in New York City in the mid-nineteenth century and the benefits that this civil-law organizational form was able to provide businessmen in a common-law environment  My data comes from archival records.

Since the end of the nineteenth century, Irish playwrights have been setting their plays during moments of transition in their countrys history to explore and establish a cultural identity  Todays playwrights continue this tradition while investigating Irelands rapidly changing, increasingly global society  In my project I analyze plays from the Irish Renaissance alongside the reactions of contemporary playwrights to Irelands recent history  I explore the ways the playwrights choose to represent moments in Irish history, as well as the ways their characters shape their personal history through methods of storytelling  In these plays, establishing a new version of the past is a key step in the creation of a personal or cultural identity.

Many Nepali peasants supported the decade-long Maoists Peoples War  Today, both the Peoples War and the autocratic rule of the King have ended  Maoists are being rehabilitated; Nepal moves towards Constituent Assembly elections  But were the peasants ever revolutionary? A revolutionary peasant, according to the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists), will have both the political consciousness and the organizational ability to seize state power  However, many Nepali peasants were up in arms, not to seize state power, but to secure their land rights  Further, revolutionary politics in Nepal today includes nonparty agents as well as political parties  Peasants were mobilized by the dynamic involvement of NGOs advocating for land rights on behalf of the peasants  With the help of these NGOs, Nepali peas-ants organized themselves into a nation-wide network demanding their rights and land reform  As peasants gain political consciousness they do so to claim their rights, not necessarily to overthrow the state.

During the Paris Commune of 1871, the last in a series of radical uprisings that defined the nineteenth century in France, Paris became both a literal and figurative battleground of competing visions of modernity  The bloody conflict between the Third Republics moderate republicans and the insurgent Communes radical republicans would decide more than the command of the city; the outcome would determine Frances future as a republican nation  To the Communes socialist democrats, the city represented the forefront of worldwide social regeneration and their Paris reflected this identity both physically and socially  When the Third Republic ultimately triumphed, the moderates undertook the conversion of France to republicanism and the sanitization of Pariss revolutionary past  In my presentation, based on my senior thesis, I will explore the ideological struggle for Paris as well as relationships between political ide-ology, urban space, and national identity.

The goal of this research is to study the acid-stress response of Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803  To study the acid-stress response, stationary-phase proteins, produced as a response to acid-stress conditions at pH 6 2, were harvested through lyophilization and BPER extraction  One- and two-dimensional electrophoresis techniques were employed to accomplish proteomic analysis of the proteins extracted  1-D electrophoresis separates proteins by molecular weight while 2-D separates by molecular weight and charge  The differences in proteins expressed between acid-stressed and non-acid-stressed cells observed from these studies, as well as those of previous students, have revealed the variation of gene expression at the protein level found under acid-stress conditions  Further isolation, comparison, and identification of stationary-phase acid-stressed proteins are underway.

Cyanobacteria are alkalophilic and raise the pH of their environment when placed in acidic media via several postulated means, including amino-acid decarboxylation  Amino-acid decarboxylases are enzymes that catalyze the reaction in which a carboxyl group is removed from amino acids  Secretion of the resulting basic amine raises the pH of the environment  Previous results showed increased decarboxylase activity in acid-stressed cyanobacteria  Western Blot analysis of decarboxylase synthesis is being used to determine whether synthesis of amino-acid decarboxylases is part of the acid-stress response of cyanobacteria  Current data have shown increased decarboxylase synthesis in cyanobacteria acid-stressed for three different time periods, suggesting that amino-acid decarboxylation is involved in the acid-stress response of cyanobacteria.

When acid-stressed at a pH of 4 0 or above, cultures of Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803 are observed to raise the pH of their medium  The increase in pH appears to be density dependent when cells are stressed below a pH 6  denser cultures demonstrate a greater increase in pH than less dense ones  Cells grown in non-acid-stress conditions also demonstrate an increase in external pH over time, but the increase is not density dependent  It is hypothesized that acid-stressed cyanobacteria excrete something into their environment, raising the pH  Ammonia was selected as a possible candidate for excretion since ammonium is readily avail-able in the cell, thanks to its role in nitrogen assimilation  Ammonium development over time in acid-stressed cultures was found, but never in a culture that survived the acid stress  It is possible that ammonium measured in these cultures came from lysed cells and not active excretion.

At least five antiporter genes involved in active transport have been identified for Synechocystis sp  PCC 6803, a strain of cyanobacteria often used in scientific research  Studies suggest that sodium/proton antiporters play a role in regulating internal and external pH in acid-stressed cells  To study this hypothesis, the internal pH of cells grown under ideal and acid-stressed conditions was determined through analysis of Pi chemical shifts using 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy  Living cells were studied in 20mm NMR tubes, where light and 5% CO2 in air were provided, mirroring normal growth conditions; confocal microscopy showed cell viability  Future studies will focus on generating high-resolution spectra as well as using 23Na NMR spectroscopy to ascertain the role of the sodium/proton antiporters in a cells ability to maintain its internal pH.

The cyanbacterium Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803 has developed methods of optimizing growth in its environment  As photosynthesizers dependent upon light, Synechocystis 6803 cells have been shown to move relative to a light source  Cyanobacterial type IV pili appendages have been shown to drive bacterial movement toward or away from light as positive or negative phototaxis functions in motility and surface adherence  Cells were plated on mineral medium agar and were exposed to a unidirectional white light source to determine if phototaxis could be induced in Synechocystis 6803  The presence of type IV pili in Synechocystis 6803 cells exhibiting phototaxis was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and growth in plates.

Sometimes vivid, sometimes elusive, sometimes misleading  for better or for worse, our memories make up part of who we are  Some events can be recalled deliberately, whereas others may influence our behavior without conscious recollection  These two types of memorial effects are examples of explicit and implicit memory, respectively  My thesis research focuses on a specific type of implicit memory called priming  Priming is the result of prior experience with task stimuli, and can affect task performance even when the rememberer cannot consciously recall having previously encountered the stimuli  My project seeks to determine if priming is beneficial or costly (or both) to our implicit memory processing.

Learners of an emerging sign language in Nicaragua present a rare opportunity to study the relationship between spatial language and cognition  In this unique linguistic community, the children have rapidly added the linguistic means to encode spatial relationships, while the adults have yet to acquire such language  This creates an inverted community where adults have more experience with how objects are spatially related than children do, but have less understanding of spatial language  This study examined whether mental rotation skills of the Deaf Nicaraguan signers correlated with their mastery of spatial language  We examined older signers, younger signers, and a comparison group of 11 American Sign Language (ASL) signers  We found that younger Nicaraguan signers outperformed the older ones, and their performance correlated with their spatial language  Further, their mental rotation skills did not significantly differ from ASL signers  Thus, language seems to play an important role in spatial cognition.

Our work focuses on a new class of bacterial cyclic nucleotide-gated (bCNG) ion channels that will provide insight into ligand gating in higher organisms  Eukaryotic ion channels analogous to bCNG ion channels play an important role in such physiological processes as sight, smell, and cardiac function  Past computer modeling studies predicted the structure of bCNG ion channels  We are looking to verify this predicted topology using biochemical techniques  By converting specific amino acids to cysteine, we induced mutations in our channel  We then used a reagent that would only react with cysteine residues outside of the cell membrane  Any reagent attached to cysteine was visualized by Western blot using a luminescent detection reagent  We successfully made these mutations in E  coli, an easily manipulated species  Mapping the topology of the membrane protein will aid in future studies focusing on the channel.

Buforin II (BF2) is a twenty-one amino acid polycationic antimicrobial peptide that is believed to translocate into cells and bind to nucleic acids without causing membrane permeabilization  The sole proline residue of BF2 has been shown to form a disruption in the peptides -helical structure and to be important to translocation  We have investigated a series of BF2 variants that alter the position of its proline by one residue or one helical turn  To elucidate the mechanism by which wild type BF2 and these variants interact with and enter cells, the interactions of buforin II with lipid vesicles of varying compositions of were examined  Fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism measurements were utilized to determine the membrane affinity and secondary structure of buforin II  We have also measured the translocation ability of the BF2 variants into lipid vesicles using an ELISA-based assay with biotin-labeled peptides.

The preschool years are a critical time in which the interaction between social and gender development strongly impacts how young children view others and how they behave  Gender-based rules of behavior are often transmitted from parents to their children  What behaviors develop when preschoolers are raised by a depressive mother? Studies have demonstrated that children influenced by maternal depression will display more maladaptive behaviors than children without depressed mothers  However, while many studies have focused on infants and older children, few have focused on the links between maternal depression and preschoolers behavior problems  My research investigated the relationship between maternal depression and the development of problem behavior in preschool-aged children, with a focus on gender differences.

In 1943, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the free speech clause of the First Amendment and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U S  Constitution protect students from being compelled to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance  West Virginia Board of Education v  Barnette (1943) precipitously reversed the Courts previous position condoning the compulsory flag salute, articulated just three years earlier in Minersville School District v  Gobitis (1940)  The seemingly unexpected change of heart surprised contemporary observers  I examine public debate about the flag salute and its influence on debate within the Court in order to better under-stand not only the Courts reversal in these two cases but also the Justices broader effort to redefine the relationship between the Court and American society during the 1940s  I show how and why this process cost the Court its unity.

While some trans people protest against medical and psychological definitions of transexuality as a disorder, most rely on the medical establishment for basic health care, hormones, or surgery  Trans individuals who write zines, or self-published pamphlets, make up a radical subculture within the transgender community, further complicating their relationship with medicine  Trans zinesters often consider gender to be fluid, expressing a freedom to play with gender and a desire to subvert the gender binary  Many write about resistance to centralized authority, including medical authorities, yet others encourage their readers to seek medical care  Examining zines drawn from four major archives, I explore both the criticisms and medical needs of trans zinesters, showing how the current medical system both alienates and assists this community of self-identified radical trans persons.

Julian Barnes is a name that neither academics nor recreational readers are very familiar with  An author whose work ranges from essays, to short stories, to novels, Barnes is unique in that he explores postmodern concepts in his writing, while simultaneously disclaiming any attachment to theory  My thesis attends to four of his novels: Flauberts Parrot, A History of the World in 10  Chapters, Talking it Over, and Love, Etc  Although the books are distinct in subject matter and style, each takes up the connections between truth and fiction, representing the complexity of these connections both thematically and formally  By examining Barness influences, contemporaries, and works, I offer a study into an intensely self-contradicting author whose work nonetheless contains consistent themes and ideas, and which is ultimately essential to the study of contemporary literature.

One of the most devastating aspects of the developmental disorder Rett Syndrome is that affected girls develop typically for 6 to 18 months before entering a period of regression and losing acquired skills and language  Because of this regressive nature, the need for treatments effective after symptoms have manifested is pressing  We have found that exposure to an environment enriched with cognitive and sensory stimulation alleviates some of the motor and cognitive deficits associated with Rett in a mouse model of the disorder  Because we did not introduce the enrichment until relatively far into development, our results provide promising evidence for the effectiveness of late interventions in the disorder  Further research will examine neurochemical changes associated with the behavioral improvement following environmental enrichment.

Schizophrenia, a debilitating mental disorder, is characterized by positive symptoms (e g  hallucinations), negative symptoms (e g  flattened affect), and cognitive disorders (e g  subtle memory deficits)  Currently drug treatments for schizophrenia treat primarily the positive symptoms leaving the more subtle negative and cognitive symptoms largely untreated  We hypothesize that the negative and cognitive symptoms are related to malfunctions in the glutamatergic neurochemical system  We are working with mice with a genetic mutation in one enzyme in the glutamatergic system to model the symptoms associated with schizophrenia  Here we show that the mutant mice react virtually identically to controls in pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), a behavioral test to determine whether the mice can learn to dampen a response to high-decibel sounds  Other previous studies have used pre-pulse inhibition to model schizophrenic symptoms  These data do not support our original hypothesis but may indicate that symptoms resulting from the mutation may be too subtle to detect with PPI.

Rapamycin is a drug with immunosuppressive and potential anticancer properties that inhibits growth of eukaryotic cells by disrupting the activity of the protein TOR  TOR plays a fundamental role in control-ling a variety of processes related to cell growth, most notably ribosome biogenesis  Although growth and division are distinct cellular processes, links between the TOR pathway and the cell-division cycle are likely to exist  Research shows that cells lacking Clb5, an important cell-cycle regulator called a cyclin, are hypersensitive to rapamycin, suggesting that TOR and Clb5 may have overlapping functions  Rapamycin treatment has been shown to cause microtubule depolymerization and nuclear-positioning defects in wild type cells  Using fluorescence microscopy, this research aims to determine if these defects explain the rapamycin hypersensitivity of Clb5 and, more broadly, to uncover a novel connection between TOR and the cell cycle.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer low-toxicity and high-specificity alternatives or adjuncts to conventional cancer treatment  Immunotherapy using mAbs is a promising approach to treating pancreatic cancer, which has poor prognosis and is typically unresponsive to chemotherapy or not amenable to surgery  The mAb CHO31 1 binds to a membrane glycoprotein A33 (GPA33) over-expressed by gastrointestinal tract tumors and kills pancreatic tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo  Part of our ongoing development of CHO31 1 as a potential immunotherapeutic is the molecular characterization of the CHO31 1 binding site (epitope) on A33 and its genetic effects on the tumor cell  The epitope recognized by CHO31 1 is determined by assessing fluorescent mAb binding to GPA33 expressed on noncancerous mammalian cells transformed with genetically engineered A33  Removal of regions within the extracellular domain of A33 should localize the CHO31 1 epitope.

Estradiol and progesterone act in the rodent brain to elicit changes in behaviors and physiology  Estradiol induces progesterone receptor (PR) expression in brain regions involved in female reproduction  Nuclear-receptor coactivators enhance the ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of steroid receptors, including estrogen receptors (ER) and PR  Work by our lab and others has shown that two nuclear-receptor coactivators, steroid-receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and SRC-2, are important in ER-mediated induction of PR in brain and in steroid-dependent behaviors  In order for nuclear-receptor coactivators to function in hormone-dependent transcription and behavior, the receptor and coactivator must be expressed in the same cell  Using a triple-label immunoflurescence technique, we will determine if individual PR containing cells in brain express SRC-1 and SRC-2  These experiments will further our understanding of basic mechanisms of how hormones act in the brain, and their possible role in brain disorders such as depression and Alzheimers disease.

Notch receptors are multidomain trans-membrane proteins that are important for cell-cell communication and development  The Lin-12/Notch Repeat (LNR) is a small disulfide-rich sequence of 35 residues first identified within the Notch receptor  Deregulated Notch signaling has been linked to many human diseases such as sclerosis, artereopathy, and leukemia  Functionality of this protein depends on the proper folding of the molecule  It has been shown that Ca2+ is required for LNR folding  This study will test the effect of other divalent cations during LNR folding using the first LNR from human Notch1 and compare it to that of Ca2+  The results of this study will help to elucidate the mechanism of metal binding and importance of metal type specificity during the protein-folding process.

Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is a metalloenzyme highly expressed in the brain, testis, and pituitary glands of mammals, and is involved in the metabolism of small peptides active in the central nervous system  Previous work suggests that TOP can metabolize an unusually wide range of substrates due to the flexibility of a loop opposite the binding pocket  Therefore, we are exploring the relationship between structure and function of the enzyme by comparing the activity of wild type and mutated forms of TOP with different size substrates to determine which mutations affect its binding capacity  Specifically, we are investigating the 599-611 loop region of TOP which has been chosen because of its high glycine content, known to give an enzyme flexibility  By substituting glycine with much bigger amino acids like alanine or proline, we can pinpoint which residues are specifically involved in TOPs unusual flexibility.

Through working with the community-health branch of Silliman University Extension Program in Dumaguete, Philippines, I realized that while humanitarian aid is vital to developing countries, it can also result in inadvertent negative effects  Aid accomplishes much good, but its particular execution often fails to take advantage of available resources  This has resulted in inefficiencies that deprecate recipients self-image and engender new ambitions that in the grand scheme tend to undo much of the good aid has made possible: watered-down condensed milk instead of breastfeeding for infants, ill-adapted concrete rather than well-adapted bamboo houses, hospital-centered rather than preventative health care  The purpose of this presentation is to explore the reasons why aid does not seem to work at its maximum potential, to examine the negative consequences, and to offer some suggestions for improving aids effective-ness.

Research shows that men are significantly more influential than women (Lockheed, 1985) and moreover, that men particularly resist womens influence (Eagly & Carli, 2007)  Influence differences between males and females begin as early as preschool and like men, boys resist female influence more than male influence  Boys even resist their mothers more than girls do  An investigation of 2-6 year-olds concluded that boys listen more often to their fathers than their mothers, but girls are equally influenced by both parents (Power, McGrath, Hughes, & Manire, 1994)  However, this phenomenon may be culture bound  Evidence suggests that women are viewed as more agentic in the African American community than among Caucasians, suggesting that African American boys may be equally influenced by both males and females (Kane, 1992)  To test this hypothesis, in this study I assessed how influential male and female puppets were when interacting with African American and Caucasian preschoolers.

The current study will examine the relationship between eating attitudes and two of its potential risk factors, level of voice and internalization of the superwoman ideal, in over 150 seventh- and eighth-grade students  Previous research has found that unhealthy eating attitudes and behaviors predict eating disorders in adolescents  It is expected that low levels of voice, defined as the difficulty one has in expressing his/her thoughts, feelings, and needs in relationships, will positively correlate with unhealthy eating attitudes and depression  We also expect to find a correlation between unhealthy eating attitudes and internalization of the superwoman ideal, defined as an unachievable internalization of both masculine and feminine characteristics  This study will be the first to examine the relationship between all three variables in male and female adolescents.

This documentary project has grown out of my course work in The History of American Healthcare: Race, Class, and Gender last spring  The goal of this documentary project is to not only record Black womens story, but celebrate their accomplishments as being a Black woman leading in the fields of health and science  Although there has been extensive work on the history of these Black female physicians, there still isnt a lot of information  The absence of scholarly information on the contemporary Black women in health-care is what inspires me to focus on this current time frame  What I explore in my project are the contemporary stories of Black women in healthcare  It is interesting to note if whether or not these womens stories are similar despite their generational differences, and if the support systems are the same  I want to know if much has changed in the lives of elite Black professional women from Jim Crow to the present day, specifically, Black women in science, medicine, and public health in one of the most geographically predominant areas for scientific and medical advancement, Boston, MA.

Ogden Codman, in addition to being the co-author with novelist Edith Wharton of the highly influential The Decoration of Houses, was a successful interior designer from the 1890s through the 1920s  One of his most famous commissions comprises the upper floors of The Breakers mansion in Newport, Rhode Island  These rooms are not only significant as an example of Codmans Louis XV and XVI style, but also as a symbol of the widespread contemporary interest in eighteenth-century France, especially among the socially aspiring nouveau riche who wished to be associated with the former monarchy in order to legitimize their power and social standing  This interest was also reflected in the work of other designers and in literature, theater, and fashion.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been utilized widely to study systemic structure and function noninvasively in vertebrates  We are developing a new technique to study neural function in invertebrates using manganese (II), which enters neurons through voltage-gated calcium ion channels during periods of neuronal activity and selectively enhances those regions of the brain and nervous system that have been recently active  To discover an optimal stimulation protocol for crayfish (Cherax destructor) photoreceptors, the effects of varying the timing and intensity of light pulses were examined by extracellular recordings from the optic nerve  The resulting optimal stimulation protocol will be used to develop Activity-induced Manganese-dependent MRI (AIM MRI) by comparing signal intensities of brain and optic nerve MR images with and without the light stimulus.

In our study, we utilize 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy to noninvasively determine the ability of cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp  Strain PCC 6803 to regulate their internal pH  31P NMR spectra include signals of cell metabolites such as inorganic phosphate (Pi) and ATP that are identified by their chemical shifts  Since the chemical shift of inorganic phosphate is pH sensitive, we were able to determine whether the internal pH of cyanobacteria is maintained at homeostasis by experimenting with cells under ideal and acid-stressed conditions  A titration curve showing the relationship between chemical shift and pH was produced with a solution of Pi at known pHs and the same ionic strength as the cyanobacteria  We use this titration curve and our NMR spectra of the cells to determine the cells internal pH.

Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder which is the second leading cause of mental retardation in girls, and for which there is no cure  Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to non-invasively investigate the brain chemistry in a mouse model for RTT  We calculate the metabolite concentration ratios choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) and N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) by integrating the corresponding peaks of the MR spectra obtained on post-natal days 21/22, 35/36 and 42/43  Preliminary data suggest that postnatal day 35/36 is an important time in development, because at that point the Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr ratios are lower in females with Rett syndrome compared to wild-type  This information may be useful in understanding the source of the symptoms, and in future studies to determine the relative efficacy of putative treatments.

Surface coils are flat resonators which, when placed in close proximity to the region of interest of an animal/sample in a magnet, produce high quality Magnetic Resonance (MR) images and spectra  MR studies at Wellesley College have previously been done using a whole-body resonator instead of surface coils  In order to obtain higher-resolution localized images and spectra, we have designed and built a new receive-only surface coil which resonates at the Larmor frequency of protons in our Bruker Avance (400 MHz, 9 4 Tesla (T), 8 9 cm vertical bore) micro MRI system  We have also optimized parameters of different three-dimensional T1-weighted gradient echo pulse sequences which can be used to produce fast, high-resolution 3-D images in our ongoing mouse and crayfish studies.

Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) is being developed to improve delineation of brain structures and perform functional studies on mouse models for neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett Syndrome  MEMRI offers a unique approach to enhancing contrast in T1-weighted MR images and is increasingly being used for animal studies in the brain and spinal cord  Manganese (II), an analog for calcium (II), enters excitable cells through voltage-gated calcium channels and is transported in axons  Upon accumulation in the brain, divalent manganese ions alter T1 and T2 MRI relaxation times  In our study, manganese (II) was delivered through intraperitoneal injections to determine viable concentrations of the contrast agent and to monitor any behavioral or physical changes resulting from the injections  The manganese accumulates in the hippocampus and differences in signal intensities are determined using T1 measurements.

Children gradually become less egocentric with age, but they do not seem to under-stand that people can have beliefs that differ from reality until around the age of four  With this false-belief understanding, children demonstrate a mature theory of mind, the ability to attribute mental states to others  Existing research suggests that both executive function and language development contribute to false-belief understanding  In particular, inhibitory control (self-regulation) and mastery of complex grammatical structures have shown positive correlations with false-belief understanding  This study is the first to longitudinally examine the relative contributions of each of these factors to false-belief understanding in English-speaking children  Thirty-two preschoolers received a battery of tasks assessing complement mastery, inhibitory control, and false-belief understanding twice over the course of three months  The results of this study will determine which factor  mastery of complex language or inhibitory control  contributes more to childrens understanding of false belief.

Second-order false-belief understanding is the understanding that people can have beliefs about the beliefs of other people  That is to say, I understand that Mia thinks that Sara thinks her dog is green  This awareness normally develops in children between the ages of six and seven  However, many language-delayed children, like those with autism, struggle with understanding these complex mental states  It is unclear however, whether their struggles result from an inability to follow the complex language of the traditional measures of second-order false-belief understanding, or from a true failure to understand this concept  Currently, there are no second-order false-belief measures that do not require complex language to administer  We have been testing the validity of several different nonverbal measures of second-order false-belief understanding with a normal adult population  If these tests are successful, we hope to modify them for use with several low-verbal populations.

Purple loosestrife is a very aggressive invasive plant species that can destroy natural plant communities  This plant is not just a threat to the outside environment, but also affects Wellesley Colleges natural environment  With this in mind, purple loosestrife was grown in the greenhouse from seeds found on campus  These plants received a variety of treatments to mimic the environment surrounding them in an effort to determine what factors influence their growth and rampant reproduction  These treatments included: exposure to pokeweed juice (pokeweed is another competitive plant on campus, but is native); exposure to run-off from fertilized grass; and direct exposure to fertilizers  The five-month experiment allowed time to observe the entire growth cycle, from germination to seeding, for the purple loosestrife and gave ample insight to the plants growth in relation to its surroundings.

One more defect and they would cease to exist, Buffon quipped in 1765  Sloths are exceptional  Tree sloths Choloepus and Bradypus comprise two of three genera that break the seven-cervical vertebrae mammalian constraint  Choloepus displays reduced cervical vertebral counts while Bradypus displays enhanced counts  Phylogenetic relationships between the genera indicate independent origins of arboreality and anomalous counts, but dont explain the mechanism by which the counts arose  Recent molecular evidence suggests that lateral components of vertebrates  limbs, distal ribs, and the sternum  are patterned separately from the axial vertebral column  A mismatch between axial and lateral patterning may cause ribs to appear at nontraditional positions along the vertebral column  Our data suggest that in sloths, patterning of lateral components has changed relative to axial components; the constraint has not been violated, but lateral patterning has been disrupted.

Type 2 diabetes is an escalating public health problem in this country and around the world  In order to treat this disease, research efforts are focusing on therapeutics that reinstate pancreatic insulin production  The Haines lab is studying the molecular interactions between a small peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), that regulates insulin production and release, and its membrane-bound receptor GLP-1R  Our current research involves two separate approaches to this problem  One project explores the properties of GLP-1 that allow it to bind to the receptor and activate it  A second project investigates how a small molecule can bind to GLP-1R and turn off its ability to regulate insulin  Ultimately, the results from each of these projects will inform the development of new treatments for diabetes.

Immediately dubbed The Lunatic Express by critics in the British Parliament, the Uganda Railway never promised much by way of development; on the contrary, its main purpose was to beat the Germans to effective occupation of Uganda and (supposedly) protect the Suez Canal through control of the Upper Nile  However, the 5,502,592 bill forced the British to find a way to make the railway profitable, leading to the formulation and implementation of technocratic visions aimed at molding East Africa into a self-sufficient satellite of the British Empire  The results, of course, were mixed  This presentation discusses the complex ways in which the Uganda Railway transformed social, political, and economic life in Kenya and Uganda.

The partition of India and Pakistan did not begin on August 15, 1947, but as an idea early in the twentieth century and continues as a reality today  By examining the context of religious revivalism both as an invented identity of colonization and as an inherent ideal for religious groups in India, I will discuss the narratives of many Punjabi Hindu Nationalists who migrated to India from what is now Pakistan  Hindu Nationalists debated with members of the Muslim League and other groups over how to make the nation truly independent, discussing issues such as representation in the new government and choosing a national language  Furthermore, Partition caused rifts not only on communal or sectarian lines, but also along regional and ideological lines  Thus my work illustrates the trajectory of partition from invented British colonial definitions of identity to the way these identities were internalized and continued after Independence.

A comparative study of Irish and Indian nationalism in the late-colonial era reveals a number of similar themes and obstacles in the elite formations of national identity  Visions for a postcolonial nation were often divided between a religious, ethnic interpretation of national identity and the lure of a more modern, often socialist overthrow of Empire  Not mere products of cultural coincidence, intellectual elites of Ireland and India often found themselves in London  Through movements such as Labour, Theosophy, and modernist literature, the anticolonial nationalist dialectic was played out within the cultural bounds of the city  Intellectual currents interacted with Indian and Irish expatriate populations to construct a political narrative that was aware of, yet distinct from, corresponding anticolonial movements within India and Ireland themselves, and attached instead to the metropole of the Empire.

Nanoscience  the study and use of materials with nanometer length scales  has the potential to revolutionize numerous fields because nanomaterials make new and useful properties accessible  From the creation of novel therapeutic systems to the modification of the surfaces of existing biomedical devices, nanomaterials are being explored for biomedical applications  Our research projects focus on developing the toolkit necessary for making nanoscale biomaterials and understanding their properties  We will describe our work with thermoresponsive polymers, surface modified metallic nanoparticles, and composite materials containing both.

We created a virtual ball-catching task that simulates a fly ball launched from a central point and had human subjects predict where the ball will land  Many properties in the task were changed such as the balls absolute size, its varying size throughout the trajectory, the presence of a background grid as a reference point and the percent of the flight trajectory shown to the viewer  Analysis of the viewers catching paths and final landing site pre-dictions as a function of our variables helps to determine which visual cues are used to perform this task  This study also addresses the extent to which viewers predict the balls flight trajectory as opposed to relying on a self-correcting tracking strategy while the ball is in flight.

My research involves the theoretical study of cuprates, which are compounds whose elements are sandwiched between copper oxide, square lattice plane layers  We know that when electrons are removed from these planes (through doping) the electron interactions change  The specific aim of my thesis is to find the best possible model at zero doping  This involves taking a model Hamiltonian (in the form of the Extended Heisenberg Hamiltonian), deter-mining its groundstate wavefunction by the Variational Monte Carlo method (which involves testing different trial wavefunctions  specifically the striped and the checkerboard wavefunctions), then using this groundstate wavefunction to determine the magnetization predicted by that model  By comparing this magnetization with experimental results, I can find the most suitable model  Using that model, we can find the way the electrons interact with one another in that particular state because, at its core, the Hamiltonian essentially encapsulates the way the electrons interact.

Intellectuals as a group are defined, and define themselves as rational, disinterested, truth-seeking individuals  As a result of these characteristics being ascribed to intellectuals, they occupy a privileged space in society  Because of their presumed disinterest, their ideas are often accepted as the most correct, as uncorrupted by the need for financial and other forms of gain  However, studies of interactions among intellectuals reveal that they cannot simply be defined as disinterested and purely rational  Instead, it is evident that factors such as nonrational emotional arguments and status anxiety play a significant role in the work of intellectuals  In my presentation, I analyze these factors by looking at the case of intellectual rivalry between the nineteenth-century radical theorists Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin  This research is based on a qualitative content analysis of the theoretical writings and letters by each theorist.

Antimicrobial peptides and ion channels are both important classes of proteins that mediate processes at the cell membrane  The histone-derived antimicrobial peptide (HDAP) Buforin II (BF2) is hypothesized to cause cell death through membrane trans-location and nucleic acid interactions  To better understand the role of BF2s proline hinge location on its bactericidal ability, four proline-relocated mutants were examined  The importance of HDAPs was also studied by characterizing the bactericidal mechanism of action of three novel HDAPs  A newly discovered family of bacterial cyclic nucleotide gated (bCNG) ion channels can give insight into how ion channels respond to small molecule ligands  To this end, the structural and functional similarities between bCNG channels and other families of bacterial ion channels were investigated through molecular modeling, cysteine mutagensis and osmotic downshock assays.

Nanoscale science has potential for use in numerous fields such as biomaterials  Proposed biomedical applications include the creation of nanoscale thin films for the mitigation of biofouling and the development of novel nanoscale materials for drug delivery  We will present results from studies of two nanoscale biomaterial systems  The first focuses on using thin films of gold nanoparticles that have their surfaces functionalized with organic molecules  These films have been proposed as coating for medical devices and as substrates for sensing of biological molecules  Despite these interests, little is known about the stability of such films, a property we have been investigating  The second system involves pH-responsive nanoscale metal oxide particles  These hollow materials are based on molybdate (MoO42) and may have good stability in acid environments but dissolve rapidly in neutral or basic solutions  Steps toward creating and characterizing these potential drug delivery vehicles will be highlighted.

We can immediately pick out one face among a sea of faces, but this seemingly effortless ability involves complex mechanisms of object recognition  One accepted theory of facial representation describes a face-space where faces are points in a Cartesian space; multiple dimensions represent the varying ways to distinguish faces (e g  by gender, age)  Inverted faces, being especially difficult to recognize, are proposed to not be represented in this perceptual space  This summer, I used a contrast-based adaptation paradigm to measure human subjects abilities to discriminate images of inverted or upright faces (test) after adapting to a face in either orientation (adaptor)  By varying the contrast, and thus difficulty, of test faces, I could see which adaptors facilitated or harmed test-face recognition  Surprisingly, upright adaptors affected the recognition of inverted tests, but not vice-versa  This asymmetry in adaptation transfer suggests that separate neuronal populations code each orientation, but have some one-way interaction.

The imaging of Asian Americans has been transformed and recycled throughout American television and film history  The archaic representations of the female dragon lady, lotus blossom, butterfly, or the forever impotent and effeminate Asian man continue to resurface in response to new forms of yellow peril, yellow face, and model minority stereotypes  Although current research and literature delve into the way in which Asian American representations are constructed in prime-time television and the media, research in regard to the latest televised phenomenonreality televisionis sparse  Reality television is a medium not only through which representation is constructed, but also one in which authenticity is negotiated  By functioning under the pretense of reality, these shows blur the line between truth and fiction  As a result, reality television character portrayals, including Asian American depictions, become complex, misleading, and paradoxical.

Critics of heavy metal music have described its images of violence and transgression as enacting a misogynistic hypermasculinity predicated upon the objectification and violation of women  Traditional scholarly analyses presuppose that women listening to heavy metal music will identify with the sexualized images of women encoded in the lyrics and that they will passively internalize and perform this construction of femininity  I, however, contend that by choosing to identify with the active, transgressive figure embodied in the implicitly-masculine narrators of heavy metal songs, women can construct a subcultural identity that subverts main-stream constructions of femininity.

Globalization has had many effects, including the production of 16 million refugees this year  My research reconceptualizes this groups social position as strangers  This project is a comparative study of refugee youth in developing and developed societies, based on fieldwork in Johannesburg, South Africa and Boston, Massachusetts as examples of these types, respectively  I explore how young refugees in these two types of societies navigate their way through their lives, including the way in which they perceive their identity as strangers and the social forces they feel shaping that identity.

In recent years, one of the Chinese Communist Partys foremost concerns has been the enforcement of its sovereignty 11am12:10pm over Xinjiang and Tibet  As the unrest in Lhasa last March showed, many Tibetans do not fully identify with the Chinese nation  What is the source of these conflicting ideas about inclusion and exclusion from modern China? This project suggests that it could be found in the Qing dynastys approach to empire, which changed drastically in the frontier during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  During the time, Qing authorities began incorporating the ethnically differentiated populations of Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia by applying the policies used in Chinas provinces  This was a dramatic shift from the way these areas were previously governed  What factors and changing ideas about governance within the Chinese state led to these adjustments?.

In an allegedly global age, one crucial question for international economic development is what makes cross-cultural business relationships possible? How do people build trusting relationships, even if they come from different backgrounds? This study seeks to answer these questions by combining social, cultural, and business history  Personal and business communications are used to understand how kinship organization in both American partnerships and Chinese trading networks facilitated the creation of social capital and trust between different merchants  Although early Sino-American interaction faced remarkable cultural obstacles, trade between American and Chinese merchants in Canton, China was extremely lucrative  I analyze one of the most successful collaborations developed between Boston-based Russell & Co  and Yi-Ho, the firm of the legendary Houqua II.

I began my thesis year thinking about objects and images that evoke strong sensory and emotional experiences from my childhood  A typewriter, a tufted living room chair, a canoe, a trumpet and a multitude of other seemingly unconnected objects form my image lexicon  Experimenting with different image combinations, I attempted to reinvent pieces of my childhood  The effort to grasp these memories, however, is in vain, for my recollections are tainted by the passage of time, dominated by a particular feeling, or revised by subsequent experiences  Using collage processes in print, drawing, and other media, I am able to add, delete, shift, and revise imagery, mimicking the fragmented nature of memories.

My thesis seeks to use the tools of the computer to create a multisensory and trans-cultural understanding of a well-known Chinese story of my childhood, Journey to the West  My goal is to have others perceive the experiences of the story as something familiar and natural, as memories that they would have had as children, rather than ones of a distinctively different culture  While digital mediasuch as film and televisioncan create potent childhood memories, there is still a need to invest in some sort of physical manifestation of those experiences  All of these memorabilia, along with attaining sentimental value, ultimately serve as tangible validations of memory  Making use of the computers ability to create and proliferate forms, my artistic process aims to make work that is approachable and conducive to interaction, echoing the playfulness of childhood.

Recently acquired by the Davis Museum, this album of French ornament prints comprises several notebooks that were bound together in a single volume in the second half of the eighteenth century  My analysis of the volumes design and production illuminates our understanding of the dissemination and accessibility of visual information at the end of the Ancien Rgime  By gathering information from comparable albums at several museums, I demonstrate how the prints functioned commercially, as commodities, and socially, as representations of objects that were used to secure and display social status  Ultimately, I aim to establish how such prints circulated in the pre-Revolutionary art market, evaluate the impact of recent archaeological discoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum on the transition from the Rococo to the Neoclassical, and analyze the role that decoration assumed in Enlightenment interiors as a means of shaping social identity.

Lydia Vasquez Carlsen and her family worked as migrant farm workers in California during the 20s, 30s, and 40s, often in the same locations captured by documentary photographer, Dorothea Lange  Her experiences have been recorded in an unpublished memoir written by Lydia with her husband, Robert D  Carlsen, and edited by this presenter  By documenting her life as a migrant farm worker, and by tinting and highlighting each memory with the spirit that allowed her to persevere despite the adverse conditions her family faced, Lydia gives scholars and the public at large an important, fuller, and more nuanced picture of the migrant farm-working experience than is evident in the extant portrayals, including those found in documentary photography, fiction, and memoir  Using photographs from the Library of Congress, and from the Vasquez family collection, this presentation will share the presenters efforts to understand and to help document Lydias story.

The number of male cross-registrants at Wellesley has reached unprecedented levels over the past few years  During the fall 2007 semester, 11 percent of classes had at least one male student  The mission of Wellesley College is to provide an excellent liberal arts education for women, but how important is the for women aspect of a Wellesley education? Research suggests that the presence of male students in a classroom environment can significantly affect the interactions between students and faculty, and may even unconsciously influence the behavior of students through stereotype threat  I use an econometric framework to analyze whether or not the enrollment of a male student in a class affects the academic achievement of Wellesley students.

As a small urban convent designed to house repenting prostitutes, Santa Maria Egiziaca provides an interesting case study of the dilemmas faced by many early modern convents  On the one hand, both ecclesiastical and secular authorities perceived female monastic institutions as subject to enclosure that separated them from the surrounding secular world  On the other hand, the demands of long-term financial survival and institutional continuity required convents to engage with near-by communities and encourage outside interest in convent affairs  Balancing this conflict of interests became a struggle that resulted in continuous com-promise of stated principles and open challenges to the convent identity.

In an academically competitive atmosphere like Wellesley, does ambition contribute to a college culture of stress, or does our environment furnish our ambition? What are the motivations behind the majors that we choose, the activities in which we participate, and the internships that we complete? Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with the class of 2010 completed by the New England Consortium on Assessment and Student Learning (NECASL), I will explore the combination of formal and substantive rationales that inform our choices as Wellesley students.

The tuberculosis and HIV clinic of Guatemalas Hospital Rodolfo Robles exemplifies a holistic approach to patient care that offers lessons for medical care in the USA  My ethnographic study of the clinic while a volunteer there in 2008 suggests that the philosophy of the clinic operates on principles of Zapatista ideology: Though the stay is free, the patient is expected to perform menial tasks such as cleaning dishes, washing laundry and maintaining his or her living space  These activities train the ill to take responsibility not only for their own care, but for the healing environment itself  My participant-observations in Guatemala address the benefits of Zapatista self-sufficiency, but contextualize such benefits within the framework of a neoliberal state that has historically viewed self-sufficiency as a threat to governmental power  An understanding of such conflict is critical in highlighting the role of NGOs in the anti-politics of healthcare reform.

Indoor air pollution (IAP) is responsible for 1 6 million deaths per year, the majority of which occur amongst the three billion global citizens who rely on solid biomass for fuel  Himalayan communities suffer disproportionally from IAP because freezing outdoor temperatures have led to a tradition of poorly ventilated houses  In addition, dungthe primary fuel sourceemits more pollution and greenhouse gases per unit of energy extracted than any other fuel  Please join me to learn about my research on IAP exposures in the Himalayan indoor environment and potential abatement strategies.

Does international trade significantly affect wage inequality in the United States? Traditional trade theory says that yes, it does; however, many notable economists have written papers which have concluded that trade of the type and scale which the United States is typically engaged in has not been a major factor in the vast increase of wage inequality in the U S  over the past three decades  These papers have chiefly focused on the effect of trade on the wages of low-skilled workers; little work has been done to determine whether burgeoning top-tier inequality has any roots in international trade  This research determines the implications of the New Trade Theoryespoused by Paul Krugman (1979) and Marc Melitz (2003)on domestic wage inequality, suggesting that trade patterns contribute significantly to widening upper-tail inequality.

The thought of a bullfight, for many, elicits disgust and revulsionhow can the public display of an animals death possibly be entertaining? This was my thought until I attended a bullfight in Sevilla, Spain  The image of the matador circling the bull in a graceful pas de deux has remained with me ever since  In Dance in the Sun, a creative nonfiction essay about the beautiful and tragicand above all, controversialpractice of the Spanish bullfight, I hope to inspire questions of the nature of art, sport, and the importance of cultural traditions.

Italy has been experiencing exponential growth in its immigrant population since the early 1990s  Though historically a country of emigration, Italy has some of the toughest and most unforgiving immigration laws in the European Union  Racism and discrimination against immigrants are a recognized problem for both the citizenry and the government  Italian immigration law reflects these negative attitudes  It permits immigrants to enter Italy relatively easily, but makes it nearly impossible for these immigrants to renew their visas and maintain their legal statuses  Instead of returning home, most of these irregular migrants become illegal and are forced to work in the grey sector to preserve their livelihoods  To demonstrate this phenomenon, I examine the experiences navigating modern Italian immigration law of arguably the largest group of migrants in ItalyAlbaniansthrough both research and one-on-one, visually-recorded oral histories.

Though the transnational anti-sweatshop movement enjoys widespread support, the moral and economic reasoning offered by the movement is frequently questioned by economic literature  This literature suggests that factory work often offers the best option for workers in poorer countries  Though it is indisputable that sweatshops are terrible places to work, the intervention of the transnational anti-sweatshop movement does not address the root cause for why there are so many women seeking out factory work around the worldpoverty  This presentation will explore the reconciliation between the economic views that argue for the benefits of factory work versus the views of the anti-sweatshop movement, which highlight the poor working conditions and low wages found in garment factories all over the world.

From 1976 to 1983 a military dictatorship disappeared approximately 30,000 people in Argentina  Over 340 concentration camps were built to aid in the torture and murder of alleged subversives; newspapers were controlled; anyone who opposed the regime was kidnapped and disappeared  Yet the military maintained active and passive consensus in Argentina and retained significant foreign support  These feats were primarily accomplished through their use of a new language of power  By publicly introducing strategic words and phrases, the military shaped the perceived reality in Argentina, naturalizing human rights abuses in the process  The militarys use of this new language is contrasted to the language used by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the only Argentine human rights organization that, at the time, publicly denounced the ongoing disappearances  During my presentation, I will draw upon research findings and my summer research experience in Buenos Aires, Argentina to illustrate this process.

Sensory information is processed along parallel tracks within the brain; within each track, information is communicated along a series of hierarchical stages beginning with the sensory receptors and ultimately integrated by brain centers involved in cognition and behavior  Within the visual system of mammals, evidence suggests that parallel tracks process information about color, form, and motion  Our lab is interested in understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie this process  We explore the mechanisms for vision in human and animal models, including macaque monkeys, squirrels, and rats  Monkeys are used to  investigate mechanisms of trichromatic color  Visual experiments investigating object recognition, dichromatic color matching, and spatial navigation are carried out in simpler animals, like rats and squirrels  The lab is also involved in experiments that address the relationship between vision and art  This panel will discuss what we are learning about perceptual phenomenon concerning color, object recognition, and stereopsis.

Though Uranus inner moons are tiny, the spacing of their distances from Uranus causes them to strongly push and pull on each other in ways that lead to chaos in their orbits  Using telescope observations from the Hubble space telescope and Keck 10-meter ground telescope and numerical models of the moons interactions, Ive investigated how the moons orbits change over short timescales and assessed the stability of this chaotic system  This system of small satellites is a dynamical laboratory for studying the stability of planetary systems in both our own solar system and extra-solar planetary systems.

We begin with an introduction to posets, or partially ordered sets, and give several examples, motivating our study by the real-world problem of triage in hospital emergency rooms  We next define the total discrepancy of a poset and find the total discrepancy of the poset An (the anti-chain)  We then calculate the total discrepancy of the poset Sn, or the Standard Example and prove our result is correct  We conclude by placing our result in a larger context.

In recent years, a new class of magnetic materials that are frustrated at low temperature have been fabricated and characterized  They exhibit many fascinating properties  In particular, they possess a large number of ground states, resulting in nonzero entropy at absolute zero temperature, which violates the Third Law of Thermodynamics  My thesis research focuses on geometrically frustrated spin systems on triangular lattice, Kagom lattice and triangular Kagom lattice  In my presentation, I will explain why the lattices are frustrated and how the frustration gives rise to many interesting thermodynamic properties in these lattices  I will also present some small and simple theoretical models that can serve as good approximations to the properties of the large lattices.

Blood-sucking leeches can increase their body mass by up to 900% during feeding  This restricts their mobility and makes them vulnerable to predation  This may create a selective pressure for rapid recovery of locomotor capacity  We have found that leeches can recover up to 50% of prefeeding swimming speed within one hour of a meal by actively expelling excess fluid  We performed a series of experiments on the medicinal leech following a blood meal, in order to test whether energy requirements for rapid return to locomotor capability are met via increased oxygen consumption, mobilization of intracellular carbon stores, or behavioral thermoregulation, independent of blood meal digestion  These data offer insight into possible adaptive mechanisms contributing to the rapid locomotor recovery of leeches following a blood meal.

Several years ago, members of the Peterman lab isolated a novel Arabidopsis protein that localizes to the expanding and maturing cell plate and is believed to be involved in vesicle trafficking during cell plate maturation  This protein, Patellin1 (PATL1), is one of six PATL proteins found in Arabidopsis and one of forty-four PATLs found throughout the plant kingdom  Phylogenetic analysis has divided the PATLs into four distinct clades, suggesting different roles for different PATL proteins  Using transgenic plants expressing PATL promoter:;reporter gene fusions, we are investigating patterns of PATL1 and PATL3 expression in Arabidopsis thaliana; publicly available microarray coexpression data will also be analyzed for all Arabidopsis PATLs using ATTED-II (Arabidopsis thaliana transfactor and cis-element prediction database) and Arabidopsis eFP (Electronic Fluorescent Pictograph) Browser  This will provide insight into the role of PATL proteins in Arabidopsis and highlight redundancies and singularities in function among  the different PATL family members.

Small noncoding RNA genes are found throughout all kingdoms of life  They are referred to as sRNA in bacteria and act as posttranscriptional regulators  sRNAs are quickly being discovered, but their cellular functions are still mainly unknown  With recent studies identifying sRNAs as regulators of virulence factors in Vibrio cholera and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, better tools for sRNA target identification are needed  Current computational pro-grams for identifying sRNA targets make predictions based on the maximization of sRNA:mRNA base-pairing  While there is abundant thermodynamic data for ribonucelotide interactions, there is a current lack of programs utilizing these parameters for sRNA:mRNA interaction prediction  For my senior thesis, I wrote a computer program that uses thermodynamic data to predict stable sRNA target interactions  This program was validated on known sRNA:mRNA interactions in a well studied bacterial species  Novel sRNA targets in a less well studied bacterial species were predicted and validated with in vitro experiments.

This project compiles and analyzes the first molecular dataset for a group of Galpagos endemic flightless Tenebrionid beetles  With this multiple-gene dataset we are studying the colonization history and mechanisms of diversification of these endemics in five of the Galpagos islands  Preliminary results indicate that contrary to the majority of island colonizers, phylogeny estimates for Stomion do not appear to follow the progression rule of island biogeography whereby islands are colonized according to their age  This interesting preliminary assessment of the diversification patterns in Stomion allows relevant comparisons with already well-established patterns in other systems studied in the laboratory, i e  Galapaganus.

-Synuclein (Syn) is a small protein that is closely associated with Parkinsons disease (PD)  Substantial evidence links Syn to mitochondrial dysfunction, and there is evidence that Syn oligomers are the toxic species causing neurodegeneration in PD  Though Syn is the focus of much research, its pathophysiological role in PD remains unclear  The goal of this project is to understand the functional implications for Syn overexpression in cells, gain insight on its relationship with mitochondrial health, and determine whether these effects are mediated by Syn oligomers or monomers  Human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells with and without overexpressed Syn were treated with a panel of mitochondrial toxins and the effect of Syn overexpression on cell health was determined by cell viability assays  Also, purified mitochondria and whole cells were exposed to Syn oligomers, and their mitochondrial health was determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting in order to determine the toxic effects of Syn oligomers.

In studies of illness related to reproductive physiology, abnormal production of the ovarian steroid hormone estradiol may be an underlying cause for a number of disorders common to women  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is an important regulator of estradiol release  Estradiol, in turn, exerts feedback control on GnRH  GnRH may be further regulated by the hormone degrading enzymes thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) and prolyl endopeptidase (PEP)  In this project we analyzed how estradiol affects levels and activity of these two enzymes in various mouse brain regions, using immunohistochemistry and fluorometric activity assays.

The ovarian steroid hormones, estradiol and progesterone, act in the brain to elicit profound effects on behavior and physiology  One physiological function of estradiol is the induction of progestin receptors (PR) in brain and other steroid- sensitive tissues  In this estradiol induction of PR, estradiol binds to estrogen receptors (ER) to induce the transcription of the PR gene in reproductively-relevant brain regions  In vitro studies have shown that nuclear receptor coactivators, such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and SRC-2, enhance the hormone-dependent transcriptional activity of ER  In the present study, we used triple-label immunohistochemistry to investigate the coexpression of SRC-1, SRC-2 and PR in individual cells in female mouse brain regions that regulate reproductive physiology and behavior  These experiments will further our understanding of how hormones act in brain and their possible role in brain disorders that are influenced by hormones, such as Alzheimers Disease and depression.

Design, simulation and optimization of electrostatic lenses are crucial to the ion imaging techniques employed to investigate molecular chemical reaction dynamics  The images obtained from studies of photodissociation dynamics are particularly dependent on the electrostatic lens configuration, which determines the spatial quality of the image  In order to optimize image spatial resolution, a simple three-plate electrostatic lens with open electrodes is simulated so that all particles with the same initial velocity vector are mapped onto the same position on a 2D detector, regardless of their initial distance from the electrostatic lens axis  Characterization of the electrostatic lens apparatus is performed using a 3D ion trajectory simulation software package  The simulations are designed to accurately reproduce experimental results and guide the design of a new experimental velocity map imaging apparatus.

The valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory taught in introductory chemistry predicts the NCN bond of  cyanamide (H2NCN) to be linear  However, experiments have shown that the NCN bond of the molecule is, in fact, slightly bent  In an effort to understand this deviation from theory, the tools of computational chemistry were used for electronic structure calculations and molecular orbital visualizations  Besides investigating the nonlinearity of cyanamides NCN bond with multiple levels of theory, this project also explored the properties of substituted cyanamides to see how the different substituents affect the NCN bond angle in these molecules  Results from this research will hopefully broaden our current understanding of molecular structure and bonding in such compounds.

Many preschoolers create relationships with imaginary companions, and these special friends generally fit into one of two categories: invisible companions or personified objects (e g , a stuffed animal that the child treats as real)  I examined videos of children with and without imaginary companions, who were asked to engage in three types of games: teaching, caretaking, and free-play  Through these videos,  I want to compare children with and without imaginary companions, as well as children with either invisible or personified imaginary friends, in terms of their levels of engagement for the three tasks and their game preferences  I would also like to examine whether the type of relationship a child has with his or her imaginary companion, whether hierarchical or egalitarian, relates to how children play  These comparisons will show us how children represent relationships through play and tell us how they conceptualize their real and imaginary relationships with others.

Gesture expands and complements information provided in the speech stream  Iconic gestures look like their referents, but it is unclear whether children can tap into the analogous relationship between gesture and referent  This study asks when and how children between the ages of two and four years interpret the gestures produced by adults, and whether they use gestural information to guide their exploratory play with novel objects  Children were presented with four novel objects with novel labels  Each label was accompanied by a shape gesture, a function gesture, a non-iconic gesture, or no gesture  Childrens play with the novel object and their memory for novel labels was coded  The findings will illuminate how children understand different types of gesture and how gesture informs childrens exploratory play.

High-stakes testing is common across the United States  The Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) is one such test designed to measure student performance and to meet the requirements of the national NCLB initiative  Massachusetts students first take this test in the spring of third grade  While some research has focused on teachers feelings about and stress felt because of high-stakes testing, little is known about the impact of these tests on young children  Third, fourth, and fifth graders will describe the feelings of a hypothetical same-gendered child taking either his or her first MCAS, or a spelling or social studies test  Results are expected to suggest that high-stakes tests cause far more anxiety than do low-stakes tests  Children are additionally expected to describe different ways of handling the stress related to testing.

Previous research has suggested that ovulation, the time of highest conception risk in a womans menstrual cycle, is correlated with distinctive changes in female perceptions about themselves and about potential mates when compared to other phases of the cycle  For example, when women ovulate, they may dress in sexier, more revealing clothing, and may experience heightened judgments of their own attractiveness  This research focuses specifically on body image and how it is affected by the hormonal cycle  Data were collected on heterosexual womens ratings of their own physical attractiveness, as well as their preferences for male body types, considering men as both as potential long-term partners, and for short-term sexual encounters  Participants completed the study once while in the high fertility phase of their menstrual cycles, and once while in the low fertility phase of their cycles  In addition, the effects of hormonal contraceptives on these judgments will be examined.

I vividly remember the first day I heard of Gillian Clarke and of her poetry, because it was the same day I saw her for the first time  No matter how hard I try, I cannot recreate the rolling, rhythmical way she shaped her tongue to pronounce the Welsh words of her poetry, but I have tried to recreate in my thesis the importance of her words  That day in Wales, she told me and the rest of the audience that nothing is until it has a word, and each time I read one of her poems I feel that I am being reintroduced to my own language  But more than that, her words give a name, a face, and a voice to countless women who refuse to be forgotten.

Why Laurence Sterne and Walker Percy? The two authors, after all, are divided by century, country, and genreSterne firmly eighteenth-century British, and Percy indisputably twentieth-century Southernand have never previously been united in critical discourse  Nevertheless, a sense of some odd resonance between their works ironic and roguish narrative voices led me to investigate points of commonality between them  In examining Sternes Tristram Shandy and A Sentimental Journey and Percys early books The Moviegoer and The Last Gentleman, I explored the idea that Sterne and Percy are not only stylistically and thematically similar, but that they share the same source: the sensitive hero figure initiated by the British literary tradition and inherited by the American South  I will discuss the ways in which Sterne and Percy revisit and revise this characterdefining him in their own version of sentimental irony.

Airborne pollution and acid rain are causing the acidification of bodies of fresh-water around the world  Cyanobacteria are being threatened by this man-made ecological disaster  Since cyanobacteria have adapted to survive in environments with alkaline pH, the decreasing pH of their habitats will have important consequences for cyanobacteria and the entire freshwater ecosystem  In the lab we are trying to determine how the bacteria will respond to acidification by stressing them at low pH and attempting to identify proteins that are expressed differently under acid-stress  Proteomic techniques such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, trypsin digestion, and MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry will be discussed.

Membrane proteins involved in transporting Na+ and H+ ions across the membrane, Na+/H+ antiporters, may help regulate the internal and external pH of acid-stressed cyanobacteria  The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803 contains at least five Na+/H+ antiporters  Studies suggest that these proteins help regulate the internal pH of acid-stressed cells, but how are the internal pH and Na+ concentration of cells with a 1 5 m diameter measured? 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to determine the chemical shift of the pH sensitive inorganic phosphate peak  23Na NMR spectroscopy using chemical shift reagents is used to detect the relative amounts of Na+ inside and outside the cells  We are now acid-stressing cyanobacteria at different pHs to follow the transport of Na+ across the cell membrane.

Many different forms of bacteria form a biofilm as a coping mechanism during times of stress  A biofilm is an aggregate of bacterial cells surrounded by a sticky extracellular matrix anchored to a biotic or abiotic surface  The main component of this matrix is exopolysacharride, or EPS  Often the presence of type IV pili, small hair-like appendages coating a cells surface, are rumored to have an important role in the initial anchoring and subsequent growth of biofilms, along with motility of cells that are not in a biofilm  In this research I am finding if the cyanobacterial species Synechocystis sp  strain PCC6803, which exhibits surface motility and has type IV pili, forms biofilms  I grow the bacteria under a variety of stressful conditions and then search for the presence of EPS  I then support these results by verifying the presence of type IV  pili using the electron microscope.

Water pollution with heavy metals is a problem worldwide, including on the Wellesley College campus in Lake Waban and Paintshop Pond  Lead is one such heavy metal that can cause hypertension and impair nerve and kidney function if ingested  Bioremediation is a method of removing pollutants using microorganisms, and cyanobacteria might be model organisms to remove heavy metals from polluted waters  One cannot, however, release cyanobacteria directly into the water, as this would disrupt the ecosystem  Cyanobacteria can be contained within beads made of calcium-alginate, an algae-derived substance, and the beads could easily be removed from the water system after remediation  The beads themselves can also remove metals from water  Our research examines the ability of cyanobacteria, free and immobilized within beads, to remediate lead from water systems.

Animal models provide a unique opportunity to study basic mechanisms of human disease, such as how genetic and nutritional factors interact to influence disease symptoms, and to test preclinical therapies  Rett Syndrome (RTT) and Schizophrenia (Schz) are both neurological disorders that originate early in fetal development and are linked to specific genetic mutations  However, nutritional factors can also influence the severity of symptoms  Here, we test the effects of maternal nutritional supplementation (choline) or deprivation (folate) around the time of birth in genetically modified mice that model RTT and Schz, respec-tively  In RTT-like offspring, we find that choline supplementation improves both physical and cognitive symptoms  In Schz-like offspring, a single genetic mutation unexpectedly protects against the harmful physical and cognitive effects of folate deficiency  These nutritional manipulations, both choline and folate, interact with genetic mutations to influence neurological disorders and underscore the critical nature of maternal nutrition.

Informal observations have often been made that a countrys language is reflected in its instrumental music  Language and music are both ways of organizing sound, and it may be that the distinctive temporal and melodic patterning of a language also appears in the related music  Little research has explored this possibility, but the few studies conducted have found similarities between the rhythmic and melodic characteristics of French music and language on the one hand and British music and language on the other  Using acoustic measurements, my research compares the rhythmic and melodic characteristics of the music and language of the Shetland Islands in Scotland, County Donegal in Ireland, and the state of Kentucky  It aims to determine if these characteristics are correlated in the speech and music in each dialect area; such a correlation may provide support for the hypothesis that music and language share processing resources in the brain.

Have you ever spoken with someone who has an accent and found yourself adopting it in your own speech? This tendency is known as phonetic convergence, and it is a well-documented phenomenon that occurs in both short- and long-term conversational interaction  My thesis examined phonetic convergence among bilingual speakers  Spanish-English bilinguals with different language backgrounds were exposed to accented speech to see whether they would adopt the accents in their own productions  This research sheds light on the flexibility of the linguistic sound system, and explores the effects of language history on peoples ability to change characteristics of their speech.

A controversial topic in linguistics is known as the argument/adjunct distinction  Arguments are phrases that form integral components of a verbs meaning, while adjuncts are simply modifiers  For example, in Mary gave the package to the mailman in the afternoon, in the afternoon is an adjunct, while the other bracketed phrases are arguments  This distinction is important for the study of linguistic ambiguity, especially PP-attachment ambiguity  For example, the PP with the telescope in the sentence The detective saw the man with the telescope could mean that the detective used the telescope to see the man or that the man he saw had a telescope  Using a reading time paradigm, this study investigates Korean-English bilinguals processing of PP-attachment ambiguities involving two kinds of prepositional objects, which may differ in argument status: dative recipients (the man in John gave a letter to his son to the man) and instruments (a lid in Sarah sealed the container with glue with a lid).

Whether they are used to facilitate dialogue or to grasp at a particular word, gestures are embedded in most, if not all, linguistic interactions  But does gesturing actually help us retrieve a word? Difficulty with word retrieval can be seen in frustrating experiences called Tip of the Tongue (TOT) states  In our previous research, we compared the TOT experiences of participants who were allowed to gesture to those were prohibited from gesturing  While we found no overall difference in number of TOTs, we found that once in a TOT state, the gesture-allowed group was more successful at resolving their TOTs  In this follow-up study, we ask whether inhibition of another body part, in this case the neck, can affect the resolution of TOTs  Sixty participants were randomly assigned to a gesture allowed, gesture inhibited, or neck inhibited condition and were asked to name 52 pictures  The findings will speak to the nature of the relationship between gesture and speech.

When was the last time you went to the doctor? What did you have for breakfast this morning? These are the types of information we typically refer to when we describe memory  It turns out that our memory systems are actually much more complex that we once thought  How does riding a bike get easier with time? Why do we often prefer melodies that are familiar to us? Why do things generally seem easier the second time around? This presentation focuses on this type of memory: implicit memory  By examining whether prior experience is always beneficial, this discussion will focus on the possible mechanisms by which previous experiences can affect our later behavior.

In general, the relationship between social movements and government institutions has been highly polarized and characterized by mutual criticism  I have participated in both extremes; following a year abroad studying radical antiglobalization grassroots movements, I accepted a job working for the U S  Permanent Representative to the United Nations  This project aims to identify and analyze certain spheres in which the positions of important actors within the UN overlap with movements on the outside  These convergences and the resulting potential for collaboration and social change are identified in comparative case studies of three thematic areas: land rights-based development, global trade policy, and international financial reform.

The quality of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images and spectra may be enhanced by the use of surface coils  Surface coils are flat resonators placed in close proximity to the region of interest of an animal/sample within a magnet  MR studies at Wellesley College have previously been done using a whole body resonator instead of surface coils  In order to obtain higher resolution localized images and spectra we have designed and built a new surface coil that resonates at the Larmor frequency of protons in our Bruker Avance (400 MHz, 9 4 Tesla (T), 8 9 cm vertical bore) micro MRI system  We have also optimized parameters of different three-dimensional pulse sequences that can be used to produce fast high-resolution, 3-D images in our ongoing mouse and crayfish studies.

the College Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1/10,000 girls, making it the second leading cause of mental retardation in females  The goal of our research is to study the neurochemistry of RTT using the mouse model Mecp21lox  The non-invasive techniques of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy allow us to perform a longitudinal study of the mice between ages three and six weeks  The images obtained are used to localize the region for spectroscopy (image below)  Spectra of brain metabolites such as creatine, choline, glutamine, glutamate, taurine, and N-acetylaspartate are then quantified; these neurochemicals are involved in important brain functions  Eventually, this will help us monitor disease progression, identify RTT at an early stage, and investigate the neurochemical effects of potential treatments.

Neurogenesis, the process of generating new neurons, is important in learning and memory  Our lab is interested in using Activity-induced Manganese MRI (AIM MRI) to identify potential sites of neurogenesis in an invertebrate model, a crustacean called Cherax destructor  AIM MRI cannot directly visualize the production of new neurons; however, new neurons normally appear in activated regions of the brain  AIM MRI uses the contrast agent manganese, Mn2+, to visualize activated regions of the crustaceans brain  Mn2+ travels through the blood-stream and is taken up by tissues through calcium-gated ion channels  When synapses fire, the activity of calcium-gated ion channels increases, which leads to an elevated uptake of Mn2+  The regions with increased Mn2+ concentrations produce areas of increased intensity in MRI images.

Membrane proteins involved in trans-porting Na+ and H+ ions across the membrane, Na+/H+ antiporters, may help regulate the internal and external pH of acid-stressed cyanobacteria  The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803 contains at least five Na+/H+ antiporters  Studies suggest that these proteins help regulate the internal pH of acid-stressed cells, but how are the internal pH and Na+ concentration of cells with a 1 5 m diameter measured? 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to determine the chemical shift of the pH sensitive inorganic phosphate peak   23Na NMR spectroscopy using chemical shift reagents is used to detect the relative amounts of Na+ inside and outside the cells  We are now acid-stressing cyanobacteria at different pHs to follow the transport of Na+ across the cell membrane.

The Wii Remote game controller for the Nintendo Wii is primarily known for its motion sensing capabilities and natural gestures recognition that enhance game play beyond traditional joysticks and buttons  From a Human-Computer Interaction research standpoint, the Wii Remotes infrared camera and gesture-based interaction make it an intuitive and innovative device  This project explores the Wii Remote outside of gaming to dis-cover its limits as a tangible user interface  By connecting it to a computer, we can program the Wii Remote to emulate key-board and mouse input or create gesture-based applications using the Wii Remote as an input  The main focus of this project is the creation of WiiPaint, a collaborative art application that allows up to four people to collaboratively create digital artwork.

Quickly replacing the television screen, todays children spend hours staring at computer monitors, while imaginative and constructive play is all but forgotten  Scratch, an easy-to-use programming language, provides a means for kids to design and implement their own projects, teaching creative problem solving skills in the process  As children actively write programs, the computer becomes a tool for artistic expression rather than a surrogate TV  Used in conjunction with the PicoBoard, this research explored ways of extending Scratch programs to the real world  Using various art supplies and craft materials, several sample projects were created to illustrate the immense possibilities of the PicoBoard  Workshops were also conducted to introduce new Scratch users to programming and building with light, sound, touch, slider, and resistance sensors.

Novice programmers are often initially frustrated with the strict syntax of computer programming languages  Recently, in an effort to ignite interest in computer programming and eliminate some of the difficulties that novice programmers may face, computer-based learning environments have been developed, which eliminate the need for the user to learn the syntax associated with a programming language  These applications allow users to drag and drop code segments, thus enabling them to learn the logic and problem-solving fundamentals of programming, without the risk of producing incorrect code  Despite the increasing popularity of such environments in computer science classrooms, the question remainsare these methods efficient for teaching programming, or do they simply prolong the inevitable of learning proper programming syntax?.

Biological Sciences Mercury, a neurotoxin, is accumulating in remote terrestrial ecosystems throughout northeastern North America  Orb-weaving spiders (family Araneidae), high-level invertebrate consumers, are excellent subjects for studying the impact of sub-lethal levels of mercury on forest animals because their webs provide snapshots of their behavior and neurological function  Spiders of the diadematus group of the genus Araneus were collected from the Jeffers Brook watershed in the White Mountain National Forest, New Hampshire, and analyzed for total mercury content  Webs were photographed and measured to test for correlations between body burden of mercury and web features  No relationships were detected between total mercury content and web structure  Additionally, one individual with a uniquely high total mercury concentration demonstrated a typical web structure  Spiders in the study area appear to be largely unaffected by mercury pollution.

The northern shore of the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico, is interrupted by the mile-long Rompeolas Pier  Built in the 1940s, the pier creates a large wave shadow and significantly disrupts long-shore transport  Shoreline position and variation in composition, grain size, and beach profiles are compared along-shore  Results indicate deposition on the up-drift beach and erosion on the down-drift beach, as well as relative fining and coarsening, respectively  Compositional variation between beaches is related to transport and source parameters for the beach system  Winnowing of fines from the down-drift beach due to the piers wave shadow combined with the physical interruption of long-shore transport are responsible for the modern shoreline morphology and beach composition  Understanding and quantifying both natural processes and anthropogenic effects on tropical island shorelines is increasingly important in light of projected increases in the rate of sea-level rise.

Young people are traditionally apathetic when it comes to politics and voting  However, young voters turned out in higher numbers than ever before for the 2008 election, supporting Barack Obama by a margin of two to one  They worked for Obama throughout the campaign in seemingly endless ways, from joining his Facebook group to campaigning full-time  Given that political parties and nonpartisan groups have unsuccessfully courted the youth vote for years, how has Obama succeeded where so many have failed? This paper draws on original survey data of Obama supporters under the age of 30 to examine young peoples motivations for participation, and the effectiveness of numerous organizing tactics used by the Obama campaign  The conclusions present not only an understanding of the Obama campaign, but also have implications for our understanding of what it takes to increase political participation among young people.

In 1996, Elaine Aron conceptualized the trait of high sensory-processing sensitivity in her book, The Highly Sensitive Person  Although Aron and Aron (1997) claim that their 27-item Highly Sensitive Person Scale (HSPS) measures a single psychological construct, three psychometric studies have concluded that the HSPS is not unidimensional  After weeding out items that conceptually fit with established scales of openness to experience, conscientiousness, shyness, and a rich inner life, a single-factor 19-item HSPS remained  However, the reduced scale did not appear to adequately make a distinction between what Evans and Rothbart (2008) call cognitive awareness and emotional distress thresh-olds  A study of 105 Wellesley College students investigated the extent to which the HSPS makes a distinction between these thresholds, or a distinction between sensory-processing sensitivity and sensory discomfort  Discussion will focus on these results.

Is a whale a sh? Biblical references, economic interests, and common sense in the early nineteenth century thought so, and scientic authorities were powerless to sway popular opinion  The barrier between the scientic community and lay audience has been in place since people rst tried to share observations with those around them  A journal article written for an audience of experts is meaningless and impenetrable to the average reader even if they nd interest in the subject, so science writers must present scientic information in a familiar, almost narrative style  Successful writers must be able to evaluate the popular attitude regarding academic authority to avoid alienating audience members while maintaining scientic integrity  When Melville published Moby Dick in 1851, he was certainly familiar with contemporary science writing; to what extent is his almost encyclopedic account of whales and the business of whaling science writing?.

Popular prints, a valuable source of visual documentation, circulated throughout Georgian London and carried inuential, moralizing messages  During the Golden Age of Satire, health and disease were among the most prominent subjects illustrated in prints  My thesis explores the dynamic relationship between satirical prints and the evolving medical world of Georgian London by focusing on the work of Thomas Rowlandson, one of the great English caricaturists of the era  To what extent did satirical prints not simply reect but actually reform the medical marketplace? What role did popular art play in re-shaping the doctor-patient relationship, the practice of medicine and hygiene, and the rise of hospitals and other medical institutions? By examining these issues through Rowlandsons satirical lens, I hope to reveal the connections between Georgian art, society, and medicine.

Referential shift is a grammatical device used to mark multiple perspectives in a narrative  Across dierent sign languages, signers shift their torso to one side or the other to express referential shift  Although the body shift ironically depicts a character shift, it depends on the signer consistently placing characters in the same space across a narrative  We examined whether signers of an emerging sign language in Nicaragua use the body shift as a referential shift device  In the Nicaraguan deaf community, the younger signers introduce grammatical features that the older signers are unable to acquire  Deaf Nicaraguans descriptions of six videos were coded for consistency in marking spatial relations and for the use of the body shift  Younger signers used the body shift and consistently marked spatial relations more often than older signers  Thus, the use of the body shift only emerges when signers consistently locate characters in space.

People often gesture while talking  But does gesture make talking easier? Previously, we demonstrated that some individuals show enhanced word retrieval while gesturing  The current within-subjects study examined the interaction between working memory and gesture in word retrieval  Thirty-eight monolinguals completed two working memory tasks and named two sets of pictures  For one set, participants were allowed to gesture (GA); for the other their gestures were inhibited (GI)  There were no dierences between the GA and GI conditions in the number of successfully retrieved words  But the ability to successfully resolve a tip-of-the-tongue state (ToT) while in the GI condition positively correlated with auditory working memory, but not spatial working memory; individuals with poorer auditory working memory relied on gestures to help them resolve their ToTs  These results indicate that gesture plays a role in language production, but only for those whose auditory working span cannot support rapid word retrieval.

The current study examines how signers of American Sign Language (ASL) prefer to describe spatial relations  ASL can convey spatial relations in two ways  First, ASL has spatial prepositions like ON and UNDER  Alternatively, signers can use classifier constructions to iconically describe spatial relations  To sign, the cup is on the table, the signer places one hand representing the cup on the other hand representing the table  To depict the cup is under the table the signer moves the cup hand under the table hand  Thirty-one native signers descriptions of 77 short videos depicting spatial relations were coded for whether prepositions, classier constructions, or both were used  ASL signers overwhelmingly preferred to use classier constructions (93%) over prepositions ( 02%)  Sometimes they used a combination of both (6%)  The preference for classiers likely stems from the fact that they simultaneously express object and spatial information, while prepositions only express the latter.

Under low light chloroplasts spread out within a cell in order to maximize light interception (accumulation response); at high light they move to the edges of the cells minimizing light interception (avoidance response)  A comparison of 10 widely dierent plant species showed that while all plants showed accumulation and avoidance responses, the kinetics and the magnitudes of chloroplast movement were signicantly dierent  Weedy species exhibited fast chloroplast movement, while shade adapted plants were slow movers  We are examining morphological characteristics and genetic dierence in the sequences of proteins that are involved in chloroplast movement in hopes of explaining the reasons for these dierences in behavior  We are also determining the relative importance of chloroplast movement to high light stress tolerance amongst this range of species.

Molting, or the shedding of the epidermis, is crucial to insect growth and development  Although the mechanism underlying the secretion of the molting hormone, ecdysone, is known, the factors regulating its expression and the timing of the molt remain poorly understood  To examine whether certain nutrients obtained from diets are responsible for the initiation of the molt, fourth instar Manduca sexta larvae were fed diets of varied nutrient concentrations and composition until they molted  Results showed a direct correlation between the amount of protein intake and the duration of molting  Sucrose, however, failed to induce a molt  Amino acids, coupled with TOR signaling therefore may play a key role in regulating the molting process  Investigations on the link between amino acids and the endocrine regulation of molting are underway.

Normal organismal development requires the correct timing of developmental events, and coordination of these events is a result of programmed changes in gene expression  One gene implicated in the temporal organization of development encodes for the transcriptional regulator Abrupt  Much of what is known about its role comes from Drosophila studies: repression of Abrupt in y abdominal muscles during pupal development prevents progression to the adult stage, and Abrupt may temporally regulate border cell motility through ecdysone signaling in y ovaries  To examine the evolutionary conservation of the function of this gene, the eect of removal of Abrupt was examined in the beetle Tribolium casteneum using RNA interference (RNAi)  Abrupt RNAi resulted in phenotypes that included precocious eye development, reduction in pupal wings, and fusion of adjacent segments of the antennae  Further investigation on the expression of Abrupt in Tribolium development and its potential interactors are underway.

In both invertebrates and vertebrates, broblast growth factors (FGFs) regulate fundamental cellular activities, including proliferation, cell adhesion, migration, dierentiation, and apoptosis  However,  the roles of FGFs in the postembryonic development of insects remains to be characterized  To elucidate the developmental roles of Fgfs and the broblast growth factor receptor (Fgfr) in larvae of the beetle Tribolium castaneum, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to deplete the four Fgf genes (Fgf1a, Fgf1b, Fgf8, and Bnl) and Fgfr gene products in the last larval stage  The knockdowns of Bnl and Fgfr both produced defects in cuticle scleritization and texture in the larval and pupal stages  The knockdown of Fgf8 resulted in disrupted gut tracheation in the adult stage  In contrast, the Fgf1a and Ffg1b knockdowns did not produce any morphological changes  Experiments  to determine the eects of Fgfr and Bnl knockdowns on epidermal cell proliferation, tracheal development, and leg regeneration are underway.

Diabetes, a disease aecting over 24 million Americans and accruing an annual cost of 174 billion dollars in 2007, remains one of the most widespread diseases in the United States  Current treatments attempt to stimulate pancreatic insulin production, yet external insulin injections often become necessary  The Haines lab studies the insulin induction pathway through the incretin hormone, GLP-1  One project focuses on how the structure of GLP-1 binds to and activates its receptor (GLP-1R)  We are also exploring the structure of GLP-1R through a small molecule antagonist  Ultimately, the results from each of these projects will be used for future medical applications.

Many students believe that declaring their major eld of study is one of the most important decisions they will make while in college  My presentation will use data collected for the New England Consortium on Assessment and Student Learning (NECASL) to explore why students hold a variety of attitudes about the sense of community within their major  Students who experienced a sense of community in their major and believed that they were a part of that community were aected dierently by the size of majors, double-majors/minors, interdepartmental majors and eorts by major departments to foster community than those who felt that there was not a sense of community in their major.

The last several years has seen a renewed interest in popular commemoration of the 1969 Woodstock Music and Arts Festival  Despite this avalanche of coee table books and special edition posters, little academic scrutiny has been given to the relationship between Woodstock and the late 60s American counterculture at the time of the festival  Through the analysis of oral histories, memoirs, musical performances, documentary footage and underground press coverage, this study will illustrate how Woodstock functioned as an important symbolic and physical space for participatory exploration and reinforcement of pre-industrial ideals within the counterculture  This study will also explore how manifestations of the tension between the politically militant and bohemian factions of the counterculture, and the tumultuous relationship between rock music and social activism were also inextricable components of Woodstocks contribution to 60s cultural radicalism.

Community-based organizations often collaborate with schools and parents to improve the public education system in their communities  Parent involvement provides community organizers with the basis for eective collective action for change  However, engaging marginalized parents to advocate for their childrens education is very dicult  A case study of the Boston Parents Organizing Network (BPON) looks at both the successes and challenges in community organizing around education issues in Boston  For the past ten years, BPON has been working with parents to improve the quality of education in the Boston Public Schools  Through an ethnographic methodology, interviews, and history of education in Boston and BPON, the study will look at what factors inuence the success of community organizing around education in Boston.

In the nineteenth century, a Danish ballet dancer would have been instantly recognizable  She would have been trained exclusively in Copenhagen, and perform only Danish ballets  Today on the other hand, most members of the Royal Danish Ballet were born outside of Denmark and are as skilled in modern dance as in classical ballet  The globalization and internationalization of dance is particularly interesting in contemporary dance  This presentation will present original research based on performances and interviews with leaders from the Danish dance community  The history of Danish dance will be discussed as well as what the future may hold for the Scandinavian dance community.

The Wiest labs research centers on decoding the neural mechanisms responsible for conscious perception, also known as the neural correlates of consciousness or NCC  We are training rats to perform a detection task in which they must consciously perceive an auditory stimulus  We will eventually reduce the volume of the tone to a level that can be detected only 50% of the time  This way, the same stimulus may or may not produce a conscious perception, depending on whether the rat detects the stimulus or not  Using electrode arrays, we will record from dierent cortical regions as the rats perform this detection task in order to determine which regions of the brain are involved in generating a conscious perception, and whether neuronal synchronization is required.

The muscles of swimming sh expend energy to maintain balance and maneuver-ability, power forward propulsion, and drive respiratory movements  The aim of this study is to investigate the relative energetic costs of these dierent skeletal muscle roles in Rainbow Trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, during undulatory swimming  By injecting microspheres into trouts bloodstream to trace muscle blood ow and by monitoring oxygen consumption in a ume tank, the correlation between blood ow, muscle oxygen consumption, and aerobic energy expenditure during active swimming is being investigated  Thus, by measuring blood ow through looking at microsphere concentration in specic areas of skeletal muscles, their aerobic energy expenditure is determined  Results indicate the dierence in functional cost among groups of skeletal muscle, the increase in blood-ow per gram of muscle from anterior to posterior mytomes, and the transition from branchial pumping to ram ventilation during swimming.

Among the fundamental ideas of physical chemistry is the study of the nature of chemical reactions  In general chemistry classes, chemical reactions are described by simple equations such as A + B -> C + D; however, this gives little information about how the reaction actually takes place on a molecular level  As physical chemists, we understand reactions as a series of transitions between known quantum mechanical states, so by mapping how energy ows between these states over the course of a reaction, we know why and how the reaction occurred  As a primary goal, the project consists of the design and construction of an experimental vessel for gaining this type of state-specic information for gas-phase photodissociation reactions  An understanding of the process of photodissocation, A + light -> C + D, is crucial to our understanding of our atmosphere and thus combating problems like global climate change.

Smooth pursuit eye movements refer to the ability of the eyes to follow a moving object smoothly, e g , watching a baseball y over a eld  Previous studies in our lab have found a small relationship between smooth pursuit precision and both athletic and video game playing abilities  Surprisingly though, a particularly strong relationship was found with gender, favoring males  We have conducted a replication of the previous studies to see if we would again nd a gender dierence, and extended those studies to probe for a relation-ship between smooth pursuit precision and current and/or prenatal hormone levels, which are responsible for large sex dierences in physical abilities and a variety of cognitive tasks.

Water pollution is a major human health problem that limits access to clean drinking water worldwide  Lead is a heavy metal that is commonly found at unsafe levels in freshwater due to pollution  Lead can cause irreversible damage to the reproductive, nervous, and cardiovascular systems  Bioremediation, the use of biological organisms for the treatment of polluted environments, is a promising method for water decontamination  Cyanobacteria have been demonstrated to absorb heavy metals  This project examines the potential of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis for lead bioremediation  To allow easy application and removal from water systems, the bacteria are immobilized in beads made of alginate, a substance derived from brown algae, which contributes to lead removal  The lead removal properties of cyanobacteria immobilized in calcium-alginate beads are being characterized for potential application in environmental lead removal.

The acidication of natural waters is a problem that aects the ecosystem at all levels  The goal of this research is to study how a model bacterium, Synechocystis sp  strain PCC 6803, responds to such conditions; understanding the consequences at a microbial level may provide answers for a multitude of organisms  To study the response due to acidic conditions, changes in protein expression were examined  A variety of lysis methods were utilized and compared for the optimization of protein extraction  Extracted proteins were separated by charge and molecular weight using 2-D gel electrophoresis, revealing dierential protein expression depending on the pH of the environment  Proteins were treated with trypsin for analysis using MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometetry, and are being analyzed for identication.

Biolms are dened as communities of microorganisms that aggregate and secrete a sticky extracellular matrix consisting mainly of polysaccharides  Although composed of microscopic organisms, these conglomerates of microbes can have a huge aect on issues ranging from public health to plumbing  The goal of this research project is to better understand the composition of these cooperative communities and factors aecting their growth  To study this biological phenomenon in Synechocystis, biolm communities were grown and analyzed  Confocal microscopy was used to observe the spatial conguration of cells to each other and to their extracellular matrix over time  High performance liquid chromatography was used to analyze monosaccharidic components of the extracellular matrix.

The proliferation of business corporations in the early nineteenth century transformed the American economy  Critics of these enterprises claimed that they were created and owned by wealthy elite, and served interests that were odious to the people  But little is known about who actually owned shares in early corporations  Using lists of corporate shareholders collected from capital taxes imposed on corporations in New York, which were matched to early property tax records, I compare the wealth and status of those who owned stock in corporations to the general population both in 1791, when there were only two corporations in the state, and in 1826, when there were hundreds  The results shed light on the extent to which ordinary people participated in the prots from corporations during this formative period in American history.

I spent last summer working on a research vessel with scientists in the Edgerton Research Lab at the New England Aquarium  Throughout the summer we used sonar equipment to collect data on sh living around liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals located 13 miles oshore in Massachusetts Bay  These LNG terminals were recently constructed to help meet increasing energy needs in New England, and consist of extensive subsurface structure  For my senior thesis, I am using our sonar data to investigate how this subsurface structure may be impacting native sh populations  More specically, I am focusing on how sh abundance and size vary based on proximity to structure  My work is especially interesting because it demonstrates how scientic research can be utilized in real world situations  Ultimately, I hope to assess how oshore articial structures can alter sh population dynamics, and in turn, aect the surrounding ecosystems.

Biological Sciences Research on chemical pollutants is extensive because of their environmental and human health eects  Mercury is of concern because organisms can bioaccumulate mercury in the form of a toxic organic compound, methyl mercury  In food webs, levels of mercury can biomagnify, reaching high enough levels to increase mortality, reduce fertility, and cause other neurological eects  Although models representing mercury bioaccumulation and biomagnication have been constructed for aquatic food webs, they do not exist for terrestrial food webs  We used food web data collected during 2008 and 2009 to build and parameterize a model of the ow of mercury of a forest food web at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, White Mountains, New Hampshire  We used this model to assess how changing biotic and abiotic factors might aect mercury bioaccumulation and biomagnication.

Estradiol is an ovarian steroid hormone essential to reproductive function and requisite to a variety of other biological processes  Its release is regulated by a cascade initiated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)  GnRH itself is broken down by the neuropeptidases thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) and prolyl endopeptidase (PEP)  We hypothesized that estradiol may directly or indirectly aect TOP and PEP, thereby rening control of GnRH activity  In this study, uorimetric activity assays were used to analyze how estradiol alters TOP and PEP enzymatic activity in several mouse brain regions involved in reproductive physiology.

The steroid hormone testosterone has many important functions in males, including the development of sex organs, maturation of sperm, maintenance of the reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics  Testosterone production in the testes is regulated by a well-established pathway, including positive and negative feedback within the pituitary and hypothalamus  However, other enzymes located in the testes may also regulate this pathway  One such enzyme is thimet oligopeptidase (TOP), an endopeptidase that hydrolyzes short peptides  TOP is found throughout the body, but is most catalytically active in the testes and brain  We hypothesized that changes in TOP activity could aect the production of testosterone  Our experiments showed that a specic TOP inhibitor aected circulating testosterone concentrations in male mice, as well as TOP activity in the testes and brain  This study can provide insight into whether TOP regulates testosterone production and/or secretion in the testes to inuence behavior and physiology.

Our lab has found that cytoplasmic localization of the four partially redundant budding yeast mitotic cyclins (Clb1-4) is important for maintaining cell wall integrity and thus viability  We are using Western blotting and a LacZ reporter assay to examine activation of the cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathway in cells that express a nuclear-restricted Clb2 protein as the sole form of mitotic cyclin  Our preliminary results suggest that CWI signaling is elevated in cells that lack cytoplasmic mitotic cyclins  Additional results will be presented in this poster.

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex disorder that likely has both genetic and environmental etiology  We have developed a model of SZ using mice heterozygous for a mutation of the enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII)  To model genetic and environmental decits, we deprived GCPII mice of the nutrient folate in adulthood  We have found that mice with either a GCPII mutation or folate deciency display SZ-like symptoms; surprisingly, mice with both performed similarly to controls  In a second study, dams were folate-deprived prior to breeding and ospring were given a folate-decient diet  Mice were tested on tasks relevant to symptoms of SZ  Four out of ve control mice on the folate-decient diet displayed severe physical abnormalities, whereas no folate-deprived GCP II heterozygous mice displayed these abnormalities  We are currently examining the eects of folate deciency in the early postnatal period, attempting to model nutritional deciency during the third trimester in humans.

Astronomers observe that late in their life-times, stars like our sun lose mass  By looking at spectral lines of binary star systems, we hope to better understand the process behind this mass loss  One of the stars shines through the mass lost by its companion, and the absorption of certain wavelengths of light can tell us about the makeup of the gas surrounding the mass-losing star  We are analyzing Hubble Space Telescope, Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, and International Ultraviolet Explorer data of three binary star systems: VV Cephei, KQ Puppis, and 31 Cygni, to study spatial structure in the stellar winds.

Concern over Pb, Zn, and Cd contamination downstream of the Tar Creek Superfund Site, a former mining district in Oklahoma, has prompted investigation into the role of hydrous ferric oxides (HFOs) in metal adsorption and transport  The two primary metal sources to Tar Creekseepage of groundwater from mines and run-o from mine waste pilesresult in the formation of two distinct HFO types that mix with creek sediment to form a third composite type observed at downstream locations  This project characterized the chemical and physical properties of each HFO type and quantied metal associations by mineral phase  Metal concentrations and Pb/Zn ratios decrease away from the source, suggesting that metal anity for HFOs relates to sorption stability constants  Changes in HFO composition and morphology following mixing with creek sediment and deposition on downstream oodplains could aect the potential for metal remobilization.

Located in Welleet, MA, the Chequesset Neck Dike was built in 190809 to convert 1,000 acres of salt marsh into agricultural land and to control mosquito populations  The diking of the Herring River had signicant negative impacts on the estuarine environment  Cape Cod National Seashore managers have actively advocated for tidal restoration to the impacted estuary for over two decades  Now that a plan is nally underway, a major concern voiced by the local shellshing industry is a possible change in mean sediment size as a result of the opening of the dike  Last summer I collected sediment samples throughout the estuary and subsequently analyzed their percent organic content, grain size, and composition  This information will be used to characterize the current sediment above and below the Dike as well as in Welleet Harbor and give managers metrics by which to evaluate potential changes in sediment source resulting from restoration.

The Asian monsoon is a critical component of global climate, and has far reaching impacts on human livelihood in one of the worlds most densely populated regions  Unraveling the monsoon response to 1) teleconnections between global climate systems and 2) tectonic forcing is essential to understanding monsoon circulation  The spatial and temporal evolution of the monsoon is examined through paleoclimate reconstruction reaching to the Oligocene (~30 Ma)  A fundamental set of climatic and oceanic parameters including continental vegetation type, humidity, salinity, and sea-surface temperature are used to describe variations in monsoon circulation  Preliminary results show regional monsoon intensication associated with late Miocene environmental change and the expansion of C4 plants.

The project is the generation of a wave model of the pocket-beach system of Vieques, Puerto Rico  The Simulating Nearshore Waves (SWAN) modeling program creates the wave model  Data from NOAA generates the model  Real-time data collected from Vieques, Puerto Rico calibrates the wave model  Vieques formed as an island chain over a subduction zone  The diverse geology of the island includes igneous rocks, sand-rich limestones, and alluvial sediments  Sedimentary material is delivered to the coasts from weathering of upland rocks and coral reefs, forming a system dominated by pocket beaches and mangrove swamps along the southern shore, and moderately-connected beaches along the northern shore; however, the system is sand-starved  Wave energy drives sediment transport in the nearshore coastal zone and the beaches should reect changes in wave energy  The morphology and composition of the sediment of the dierent beaches around the island is considered with regards to wave energy.

Principal events in Italian history, extending back as far as the Rinascimento, the Risorgimento, and the anti-fascist Resistenza, provide concrete examples of how the southern population has been largely excluded from participation in key historical movements before and after the formation of the nation  Continual isolation of southerners from integration with their northern counterparts has created an image of southern Italians as second-class citizens  Examination of the southern question for my senior honors thesis will identify distinctive cultures, but will also illuminate many unifying features across the north/south gradient, dispelling some of the rooted stereotypes of southerners as backward, inferior, and barbaric peoples.

Art museums are sites for negotiating concepts of the global, the national, the community, and the self  In these institutions, ideas about who we are and how we should relate to the other are debated and negotiated  Yet as the nation changes, museums are challenged to attract and incorporate new visitors  My research analyzes how museum educational programming helps attract more diverse audiences  I look at three regional cases that illuminate diering approaches: Bostons Museum of Fine Arts, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art  Each museum is located in a city that is increasingly diverse and employs approaches to learning and audience building that reect regional- and museum-specic attitudes toward diversity and community engagement.

Lithuanians and non-Lithuanians alike have used dainos ancient folk songs to construct the idea of what it means to be ethnically Lithuanian  The performance of folk songs in times of occupation allowed Lithuanians to preserve their pride in their ethnicity, despite oppression  Since Lithuanias declaration of independence in 1991, the traditions of folk singing have been passed onto a new generation of Lithuanians who are reinterpreting the cultural meaning of these songs  For eight weeks I conducted an ethnographic study of music-making in Vilnius, Lithuania during its European Capital of Culture festivities  My work contextualizes and analyzes my experiences in the eld, demonstrating the critical, yet dynamic, role of folk song in the continual construction of Lithuanian identity.

Invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity and oceanic island systems such as the Galpagos are particularly threatened by introductions of exotic species  Population genetics can determine invasive potential of recently introduced populations through evaluation of the remaining genetic variation and heterozygosity  This study focuses on the winged Galapaganus howdenae, a weevil species recently introduced to Santa Cruz Island in Galpagos  Because microsatellite DNA loci, regions of hypervariable repeats, are highly variable co-dominant neutral genetic markers, they are particularly powerful tools for this type of study  Genotyping of multiple individuals across various loci and localities will allow detection of demographic expansion and genetic diversity retention  Results of this study will not only identify these introduced populations invasive potential, but could also provide guidance concerning steps needed to prevent further expansion into native habitats and contribute to the conservation of Galpagos biodiversity.

Lurcher (Lc/+) transgenic mice exhibit ataxia, or loss of motor coordination, due to massive loss of cells in the cerebellum  Environmental enrichment, such as access to toys, is a therapeutic protocol used to increase sensory stimuli  Enrichment studies performed on Lurcher mice have shown that exposure to an enriched environment improves motor coordination  Because Lurcher mice exhibit ataxia due to neurodegeneration, we hypothesize that exposure to enrichment would possibly slow or decrease the degenerative processes that occur in the Lurcher and alter brain morphology  Students taking NEUR/BISC 306 will explore the eects of environmental enrichment by designing and implementing their own enrichment set-ups and applying the techniques of MRI to better understand the mechanisms of cerebellar development and function.

Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive yet rare malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of only 14% with no eective therapies  Our goal is to create a multi-purpose nanovehicle for targeted pancreatic cancer therapy  Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-functionalized, gold- coated iron oxide nanoparticles (FexOy-Au NP) were synthesized as precursors to an antibody-conjugated vehicle for imaging and delivery of therapeutics  A gold shell was coupled to the superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (5 nm)  The FexOy-Au NPs were characterized using transmission electron micrographs (TEM), UV-Visible spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relaxivity studies  To further functionalize the nanovehicle, methods to couple a binding agent, Avidin, to PEG have also been developed  The Avidin-PEG conjugated product was analyzed by various techniques  MRI will be used to track the biodistribution of the nanovehicle and whether it preferentially targets xenograft tumors in vivo.

Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that aects about 1 1% of the adult U S  population  Glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) decient mice exhibit several of the symptoms of schizophrenia and contain a genetic mutation that results in decreased levels of GCPII, an enzyme that hydrolyzes N-acetyl-aspartate glutamate into N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and glutamate (glu)  We thus hypothesize that the mutant mice will have lower levels of glutamate than wild-type mice  The non-invasive techniques of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging (MRS and MRI) yield useful results in neurochemical studies of GCPII mice  Chemical analysis using MRS both in vivo and ex vivo focuses on the levels of NAA, glu, and glutamine in the brain  In addition, brain structure volumes were examined using MRI  By determining concentrations of these metabolites in the brain as well as structural characteristics, dierences between wild type and mutant mice were investigated.

Nanometer-sized metal particles possess unique properties that make them useful in myriad settings from information storage to biomedical treatment  Despite these potential uses, many properties of nanoparticles are poorly understood  Here, we report on a range of properties and applications for these materials  These include fundamental studies such as investigating the stability of nanoparticle thin lms and controlling the assembly of nanoparticles in solution  Two specic applications, developing nanovehicles for biomedical applications and for remediation of contaminated water, will also be described.

When organizations evaluate employees, they base their evaluation on performance factorslike how good the employee is at his or her job or how much revenue the employee brings into the rmand on non-performance factorslike race and genderwhich are based on stereotypes  Past research has shown a tendency to evaluate female leaders more negatively than male leaders, especially under circumstances where a masculine leadership styles is utilized or when the female leader occupies a role that is traditionally male-dominated  My research uses meta-analysis, a statistical method that reviews past studies on a subject, to evaluate the extent to which these factors, and many others, impact the evaluation of males and females in leadership positions.

Childhood obesity rates in the U S  are remarkably high  While physical health problems related to obesity need much attention, there are psychosocial problems that can severely impact a persons quality of life as well  Research indicates that women more frequently than men experience low status attainment and depressive symptoms as a result of weight-related stigmatization and social marginalization  When and why does this gender dierence in psychosocial problems arise? Because patterns in behavioral problems associated with childhood obesity are emerging at very young ages, it is important that research and intervention focus not only on adolescents but also children in preschool  My research addresses some of the gender dierences in overweight children, the behavioral problems that may lead to increased social marginalization, and the frequency of these behavior problems in young boys and girls.

From expression of love to obtaining a promotion, women are motivated to have sex for many dierent reasons  This study focuses on exploring women who have sex in order to elevate their self-esteem  Although engaging in self-esteem-boosting sex is culturally viewed as an inferior and negative reason to have intercourse, this study proposes that maybe its not all bad  I will rst explore dierent types of goal orientation in relation to reasons for having sex, predicting that validation seekers will be more likely to engage in self-esteem sex  Then, I will attempt to verify whether having sex in order to boost self-esteem is actually a negative behavior or whether healthy validation seekers can benet from self-esteem sex  I will do this by demonstrating that there is variation in psychological health within validation seekers and that there are psychologically healthy validation seekers who productively engage in self-esteem boosting sex.

When considering the topic of gender in lm, certain images of women come to mind: Brigitte Bardots untamed attraction, or Katharine Hepburns stinging wit  However, the complex social constructions behind male protagonists are under-studied  In my thesis for the French department, I seek to unravel assumptions regarding masculinity by focusing on a particular set of lms by director Franois Truaut  Spanning 20 years and featuring the same actors, these lms center around one character, Antoine Doinel, as he struggles through lifes major events  Doinel both challenges and reinforces the traditions of marriage, fatherhood, and work generally expected of Frenchmen, and reformulates the publics understanding of masculinity in the process.

Certain presidential candidates are perceived as frontrunners months before the rst presidential primary contests take place  Long before voters cast their ballots, the media lavishes coverage on some candidates while perceiving others as being virtually dead in the water  The disparity among candidates media coverage was perhaps no more apparent than in 2008  Why did Hillary Clinton receive more coverage than other qualied candidates like Joe Biden or Bill Richardson? In the eyes of editors and journalists, what determines candidate viability? To what extent has the growth of new media, like blogs, YouTube and The Daily Show, inuenced this process? By directly surveying those responsible for shaping and publishing coverage of the presidential primaries, this project seeks to measure the importance of a candidates personal and political characteristics in the medias perception of candidate viability.

In 1956 the rst oil well was found in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, igniting a cycle of environmental degradation, nancial wealth, and astronomical corruption that continues to aect those living in the Niger Delta today  Halfway across the world, similar events unfolded in the region of Aceh, the heart of Indonesian crude oil production and yet one of the poorest districts in the nation  Today, after decades of violent warfare, the people of Aceh live in peace with growing economic opportunities while the Niger Delta peoples continue to suer  What can be learned from the Acehnese roadmap to peace, and how does it apply in the context of Nigeria?.

Water wars are much talked about, yet the fact that there has never been a water war implies that the politics of international rivers is more complicated  The Jordan River is a highly contested international river, yet Israel has been able to dictate other riparians access to its water without using military intervention  I will explore this dynamic using the framework of hydro-hegemony, showing that Israel has used ideational power to maintain its preferential access to this resource  I will contrast this case with the Nile River, where cooperation amongst riparians has dramatically increased, and the Columbia River, where the U S  and Canada have long cooperated  I will show how dierences in a hydro-hegemons relative power in a river basin aect the fairness, and therefore sustainability, of cooperation, and how future water wars can be prevented.

British Prime Minister Lord Palmerstone once exclaimed that Britain has no permanent friends, only permanent interests  For centuries, analyses of states foreign policies as well as theories of international relations have relied on national interests as the guidelines for the creation of a long-term coherent foreign policy  Yet, what happens to the practice of international relations and its theories if we start questioning the role of national interests? Using declassied primary sources from The National Security Archive, this research uncovers U S  foreign policies towards Afghanistan in 19732008 and shows that U S  foreign policy in Afghanistan has not been guided by U S  national interests  Rather, U S  foreign policies have been merely reactive and the process of their implementation led to the formulation of U S  national interest  Thereby, this presentation refutes the common perception of the United States as an active and purposeful player in international relations and oers an alternative idea.

It is common knowledge that the multiethnic nature of Chinas frontier autonomous regions, particularly Xinjiang and Tibetmakes Chinese sovereignty over these areas highly problematic  The well-publicized recent histories of unrest and protest in these areas make it clear that the Chinese Communist Party faces great difficulties when formulating policies intended to achieve their goal of promoting national unity  At rst glance, the CCP appears to voice a strong commitment to promoting equality and providing for a degree of regional political autonomy  A close examination, however, of the policies the CCP has used to manage Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia makes it clear that all is not as it seems when it comes to the Chinese states rhetoric and their actual policies towards these historically minority-dominated areas.

As intrastate conflicts developed throughout the 1990s the United Nations was increasingly called upon to intervene in order to alleviate human suffering  At the beginning of the decade the UN answered this call with increased zeal, eager to dene its role in the new world order  Large-scale humanitarian crises had always existed, but with the end of the Cold War and the U S -Soviet deadlock in the Security Council, the UN saw its opportunity to nally play a more dominant role in the international arena  However, as the decade progressed the UN became less willing to intervene, leaving some crises unattended while acting to prevent others  Join me on a journey through the 1990s as I examine various experiments in intervention and the factors that inuenced the UNs decisions to intervene in humanitarian crises throughout the decade.

Japanese society is built around a strict adherence to the ideal of normality: school, work, marriage and family  Lesbianism is considered a lifestyle choice that is deviant from the norm and thus is rendered invisible by a widespread social silencing  The rst woman to publicly come out, Hiroko Kakefuda, challenged the community to reclaim the word lesbian and assert their space in society  In response to her challenge, lesbian activists within the last decade have taken an education-focused approach in their pursuit of social acceptance  They are amending the standard for what is normal to be inclusive of lesbian individuals through redening of terminology, creating new images of the lesbian experience, and drawing on reestablished institutions to promote an ideal Japan  By adopting the rhetoric of normality to legitimize the lesbian experience, lesbian activists are changing the notion of sexuality in Japan.

Research on body image of women around the world has focused on eating disorders thus obscuring other possible cultural dierences in body esteem  In particular, the adoption of Western cultural standards may result in disturbance of body image among Asian women because of physical disparities between them and their white counterparts  We investigated dierences in satisfaction with ethnically salient body features among Euro, Chinese, and Korean American college women  In addition to investigating ethnic variability in body image, we ascertained whether these dierences were related to the use of plastic surgery, ethnic identication, individualism/collectivism, and social class.

Science, and Robbie Berg, Physics PicoBees are small wireless computers for creating large-scale interactive spaces  Users connect sensors and actuators to a collection of communicating PicoBees and specify their behavior using PicoBlocks, a visual programming language  Not limited to LEDs and motors, PicoBees support actuators appropriate for larger spacesthey can wirelessly control battery-controlled toys and power strips  An illustration of the power of the PicoBees toolkit, Social Synapses, is an installation designed to provoke contemplation about the interconnectivity of the Wellesley community  Sensors placed around the Science Center monitor various types of activity (e g , pedestrian and network traffic) generating action potential that can illuminate artificial neurons placed around the Focus  Social Synapses emphasizes the power wielded by the Wellesley student body over the individual; it makes visible the increased illumination that cooperation permits, both literally and metaphorically.

My project aims to analyze three transnational Caribbean drag performers, both historical and imaginary, as figures that disrupt notions of monolithic national identity  I consider and compare Cuban-American singer La Lupe, queer performance artiste Carmelita Tropicana, and Puerto Rican writer Mayra Santos-Febress drag queen protagonists in her novel, Sirena Selena vestida de pena  As drag performers, these figures embrace excess; however, they not only perform the gendered acts that label them male or female, but also create what we might call a national drag that allows them to embrace multiple cultural identities in order to subvert stable definitions of nations and national identity.

Antimicrobial peptides are short polypeptide sequences that present promising targets for therapeutic developments  While many peptides kill bacteria through generalized membrane disruption, some peptides cross the cell membrane and kill through interaction with intracellular components  Based on properties of some well-studied peptides that cross membranes, the Elmore lab has designed three novel antimicrobial peptides  These peptides have proven active against a range of bacteria, but it is unknown whether their similarities to known peptides mean that they are using the same mechanism of action  One important characteristic in the design of the novel peptides was the inclusion of a helix-breaking proline residue  My research focuses on the importance of this residue on the processes of membrane permeabilization and the ultimate effect of the residue on antimicrobial activity.

Antimicrobial peptides are a component of the innate immune system in all living organisms, offering the potential for a resistance-free clinical substitution of current antibacterial treatments  Previous work in the Elmore lab focused on a histone-derived antimicrobial peptide buforin II  We are expanding on this research and considering hipposin, a related peptide isolated from the Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus  Hipposin is longer than buforin II, and includes the sequence of buforin flanked by two additional sequences  Because proline is a critical component of the buforin primary sequence, we are working with peptide mutants to determine the importance of proline residues in hipposin  Our projects begin a dual-approach investigation of hipposin, focusing on its antibacterial and anti-cancer activities  We have observed increased efficacy of proline mutants in tumor cells, with the opposite effect in bacteria.

We have used data from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer satellite to study the eclipse of the binary system 22 Vul  The binary system has a cool G-type supergiant with an extended atmosphere and a smaller but hotter B-type main sequence star, which undergoes eclipses  As the hot star goes in and out of eclipse behind the supergiant, its light shines through the cool atmosphere, and the spectrum produced is observed by FUSE  We have identified the different elements producing the absorption lines seen outside total eclipse and observed how the lines change over the different phases of the eclipse  As the hot star gets farther out of eclipse, the absorption features get weaker  The strength of the absorption features produced has been used to study the structure of the cool supergiant wind.

The quantitative analysis of atmospheric physics and chemistry requires accurate and complete molecular spectroscopic data  Additionally, the interpretation of astronomical spectroscopic observations directly relies on the breadth and precision of the data available for atomic and molecular processes  This presentation describes two projects on sulfur-bearing molecules: the design, construction, and modeling of a furnace to be used in obtaining diatomic sulfur (S2) spectra, and the collection and analysis of sulfur dioxide (SO2) spectra  These projects provide insight into the electronic structure of these molecules and contribute to the understanding of their roles in the photochemistry of sulfur-rich planetary atmospheres.

If speciation were happening at Wellesley, wouldnt you want to know? Sometimes, a single population may exhibit different body forms in different environments  If these alternate forms are adapted to their specific environments, this may further their divergence and they may someday split into new species  Bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) in Lake Waban exhibit such anatomical differentiation, with shallow and open-water fishes having slightly different forms  These two forms also exhibit adaptive differences in swimming performance in their respective habitats  I examined the functional morphology of shallow and open-water bluegill, to determine if specific differences in internal morphology contribute to adaptive performance differences.

Many insects undergo metamorphosis where a larva transforms into a pupa and subsequently an adult  While many insects develop their adult legs from internal tissues called imaginal discs, more basal insects develop their adult appendages from external larval legs  Although the mechanism underlying leg development in highly derived insects is well understood, that governing adult leg transformation in more basal insects is not clear  To investigate the mechanism underlying larval to adult leg transformation in basal insects, leg development in the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, was examined through functional studies of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and the TGF- family member dpp  Knockdown phenotypes strongly suggested that both Arm and Dpp are key regulators of postembryonic leg development  Unexpectedly, dpp knockdown also resulted in severe bodily clearing, indicating that dpp is also for fat metabolism.

Habitat fragmentation, one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, is defined as the division of one continuous habitat into multiple smaller patches  As a result of the barriers to gene flow created by uninhabitable areas between patches, populations of organisms become at risk of losing genetic variability and possible extinction  By using genetic markers to measure genetic variability, we aim to evaluate the impact of habitat fragmentation on the endemic weevil Galapaganus conwayensis on the island of Isabela and compare to those on Santa Cruz and Pinta  The results of this study will yield valuable insight into the impact on other species facing habitat fragmentation.

Our world increasingly relies on technology to convey information, both vital and frivolous, that has become ingrained in daily life  In the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, our research focuses on discovering novel ways for people to obtain and interact with digital information  More specifically, we are interested in creating human-computer interfaces that bridge the real, physical world and the intangible, virtual world  Through this work, we hope to provide seamless interfaces between people, digital information, and the physical environment  In this panel, we will present three projects that illustrate new ways for people to interact with digital information, architectural landscapes, and day-to-day physical objects: G-nome Surfer, a tabletop user interface for collaborative exploration of genomic information that lowers the threshold for bioinformatic tool usage; ArteMuse, a social mobile application that offers an enhanced museum visit; and Morphess, a shapechanging, computationally-enhanced outfit.

Political violence impacts human, natural, and physical capital in destructive ways  It hinders economic and social development, as well as undermines the security of the individuals, communities, nations, and countries  My research examines how abrupt political events, such as transitions of power and coups, affect social capital in developing countries  To do this, I use data collected from Honduran households from before and after the 2009 Honduran coup dtat  I examine trends in the measures of social trust and participation, and see whether these trends vary by income of families in the sample, land ownership, ethnicity, and region  I examine whether the distance to a capital city or major political center plays a role in changing peoples attitudes on the government or the police, since most political unrest occurred in urban centers.

What are the origins of public debt and monetized economies? How did states come to pay for major public expenses? How do fiscal mechanisms affect a states definition of its political allies and threats? This thesis traces the very early development of modern tools of fiscal management in Chinas Northern Song Dynasty (9601127)  Under the pressure of war, the Song state developed a mix of market and non-market approaches to maximize its ability to siphon cash revenue from the trade in major commodities  This remarkable process will be compared to a similar expansion of corporations under the pressure of war financing in early modern Europe over 600 years later.

Governments take different approaches to poverty alleviation in every country, influenced by their histories, institutional frameworks, and systems of governance  But is there any one approach that has been the most effective? Does each country have to tailor poverty alleviation schemes to its own specific context? This thesis project compares and contrasts two national-level schemes: Brazils Bolsa Familia, a conditional cash transfer program, and Indias National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, a rights-based employment scheme  In comparing them, I aim to analyze why each government took such differing approaches to poverty alleviation, and to examine the extent of the success of each scheme.

Dubai, a small city on the coast of the Arabian Gulf, has become a global sensation  Thirty-eight years ago, the city was known for its rich fishing industry and vast deserts, but today is home to man-made islands and some of the worlds tallest buildings  Burj Al Arab (Tower of the Arabs), an icon of the city, was one of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoums first ambitious endeavors  The built environment of Dubai, especially the Burj Al Arab has had a significant impact on the identity of the city both globally and at home  As it straddles the line between Western structure and Arab culture, the building has become a metaphor for the city and its struggle to achieve modernity and global recognition while still maintaining an Arab character, legitimizing its short modern history, and creating an identity for itself.

Local field potentials (LFPs), or the postsynaptic electrical activity of groups of neurons in a particular region of brain tissue, can quantify neural activity of that area in response to a stimulus  It has been determined that rats exhibit certain characteristic bumps in their LFPs while listening to a pattern of beeps known as the passive oddball paradigm, where a repeating tone is periodically replaced by a different pitch oddball beep  In our study, the oddball beep was found to elicit greater amplitude LFP responses in the rat frontal and parietal cortices, even in controls that reversed the pitches of the two tones  These results indicate that the heightened response to infrequent stimuli was attentional and not pitch-related  Future work will investigate whether neural synchrony, which has been linked to attention in primates, occurs in these frontal and parietal responses.

My research investigates the effect of nitric oxide (NO) on adult neurogenesis, the lifelong production of new neurons  While NO is involved in brain pathologies, it is also involved in normal physiological functions, for example in the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), invoking a wide array of cellular responses  My experiments show that NOS (nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme that contributes to the production of NO) immunoreactivity in the crayfish species Procambarus clarkii increases with bilateral ablation of the antennules  Increased levels of NO are associated with significantly decreased levels of neurogenesis in the crayfish brain  Using immunocytochemical and confocal imaging techniques to map changes in the brain, the aim of my research is to test a potential push-pull mechanism on adult neurogenesis in P  clarkii between NO and serotonin, a neurotransmitter which can up-regulate neuronal proliferation.

Adult neurogenesis, the production of new neurons in adult brains, occurs in olfactory pathways of decapod crustaceans  In Procambarus clarkii, new neurons are born in the neurogenic niche, where neural progenitor cells divide symmetrically and both daughter cells migrate along glial strands to clusters 9 and 10  Divisions of existing niche cells do not replenish the niche, but the niche increases in size over an animals lifetime  Niche precursor cells must, therefore, originate from an outside source  It has been hypothesized that circulating stem cells of possible hematopoietic origin are migrating into the niche from the hemolymph, and previous lines of inquiry have suggested a relationship between cells circulating in the blood and niche cells in the brain  In an attempt to better define this relationship, we examined the effect of hematopoietic tissue removal on neurogenesis  The numbers of cells in cluster 10 were significantly reduced (p=0 0002) relative to control and sham treatment groups  The differences in numbers of cells in the niche, though not significant, still suggest a possible relationship, which we will pursue in future.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are polycationic molecules with selective bactericidal and/or anti-cancer activity, and play an important role in the immune system of many species  Our lab has designed three novel AMPs (DesHDAPs 1-3) based on characteristics known to confer potency to buforin II, a -helical AMP that kills bacteria by translocating across cell membranes and binding to DNA  The goal of this study is to determine the antimicrobial potency, anticancer activity, bacterial selectivity, and translocation ability of DesHDAPs 1-3 and to relate these properties to the peptides structural features  Like buforin II, DesHDAP1 shows activity against several bacterial strains, and its ability to cross lipid membranes is dependent on the presence of a key helix-breaking proline residue  In contrast, DesHDAPs 2-3 do not show significant translocation across lipid membranes and display more limited bactericidal activity  This research offers insight into design strategies for novel antibiotics.

Biological Sciences The four partially redundant Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitotic cyclins, Clb1-4, mediate the transition between the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle by activating their cyclindependent kinase (CDK) binding partner  Clb1-4 concentrate in the nucleus but are also present at lower levels in the cytoplasm  When the cytoplasmic population is eliminated, cell wall integrity is compromised  To understand the molecular basis of this phenotype, our laboratory performed a phosphoproteomic screen that identified putative targets of cytoplasmic mitotic CDK activity  In this study, we aim to validate the results of this large-scale experiment  Specifically, this study focuses on confirming that Bni4, a protein important for cell wall synthesis, is a mitotic CDK phosphorylation target  We also aim to identify Bni4 binding partners in the presence and absence of cytoplasmic mitotic CDK activity to better understand the proposed connections between the cell cycle and cell wall integrity.

(Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and Donald Elmore, Chemistry Poly (ADP-ribose) (pADPr) is a post-translational modification implicated in virtually all cellular processes however its specific function in many biological pathways is still unknown  Our lab has recently shown poly ADPribosylation is involved in the stress response pathway, specifically in the nucleation and formation of cytoplasmic bodies called stress granules (SGs)  SGs are stalled cytoplasmic translational complexes critical for stress response  SG machinery includes a number of proteins containing RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that are largely responsible for binding mRNA transcripts during SG nucleation during periods of cell stress  Due to the structural similarities between pADPr polymer and single stranded RNA, we believe these RRMs bind may pADPr as well  By characterizing this binding interaction and describing a mechanism, we aim to better understand the role pADPr plays in stress granule formation  This binding interaction may implicate pADPr as RRM targets not only in the SG, but also in a wide variety of other cellular pathways.

Approximately 25 million HIV-positive people live in sub-Saharan Africa  National governments in the region have responded both with prevention efforts and with treatment initiatives, but why have some favored one response over the other? Prevention made dramatic progress in curtailing the epidemic in Uganda, yet this approach was not favored in either Botswana or South Africa  What determines health policy choice in addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic in African states? More specifically, how do governments decide which public health policies to implement in order to tackle the challenges posed by the epidemic? African leaders decide based on an interaction of several factors: economic, political, personal, and sociocultural  In some cases these factors have favored prevention, in other cases treatment, and in still other cases no significant policy response at all.

More than 1 in every 7 adults in Zambia is living with HIV and life expectancy at birth has fallen to 39 years  The country stood as a pioneer in June 2004 when the government committed to the free provision ARTs for the adult public  Prior to this, ARTs were only available privately  While the provision of life-saving ART treatment has emerged as a central part of the medical and policy response to HIV/AIDS, little is empirically known about the welfare effects of this important intervention on children living with HIV-positive adults  Estimation of the intergenerational effects of ARTs can provide valuable insights into the return on international aid investments, resulting in better informed public resource allocation decisions  My analysis explores how household behavior changes in response to increased access to ARTs if there is an infected adult in the household, measured in terms of childrens education and nutrition.

Over the preschool years children come to understand the relationship between their senses and the knowledge those senses acquire  This development may be supported by sensory experiences or theory-of-mind development  We tested these alternatives by asking hearing and deaf children to identify which of two confederates knew the identity of a toy animal when confederates had differential perceptual access to the animal  In the seeing condition, only one confederate saw the animal, and in the hearing condition, only one confederate heard it  Hearing preschoolers performed equally well in both conditions  However, deaf preschoolers performed equally poorly in both conditions, but deaf kindergarteners succeeded in both  Thus, deaf childrens greater experience with vision does not lead to an accelerated understanding of the seeing-knowing connection  Taken together, the data suggest that understanding the link between perception and knowledge is more closely related to theory-of-mind development than to experiential learning.

Anthropology Whereas disease is defined by its symptoms and treatments, my research indicates how the illness experience and its narratives affect these symptoms and treatments  By watching participant-made video diaries, I studied the illness experiences of adolescents living with sickle cell anemia, a blood disorder that most commonly affects blacks and Hispanics in the U S  The video data I analyzed was collected by Video Intervention/Prevention Assessment, a research project at Childrens Hospital Boston  Seven adolescents with sickle cell used camcorders to create about 150 hours of video diaries of their everyday challenges, successes, thoughts and activities in the environments in which they live  The illness experiences of adolescents with sickle cell are personally unique, yet can also reflect common experiences  Furthermore, the use of audiovisual narratives (video diaries) can provide rich, qualitative data by allowing participants to be honest and reveal experiences they may have otherwise kept to themselves.

The Panic of 1907 was a major financial crisis, with striking parallels to the crisis of 2008  As with the recent financial meltdown, the period preceding the 1907 panic saw rapid innovation and change within the financial system  A new type of bank, called a trust company, became an increasingly important financial intermediary  These firms accepted deposits and competed with commercial banks, and yet were not subject to the same regulatory scrutiny  Many of these trust companies became important lenders to industrial companies and railroads, and would place one or more of their directors on the boards of their client firms  The outbreak of the Panic of 1907 occurred following a series of scandalous revelations about the investments of some trusts, resulting in widespread runs on many of these firms  The connections between the trust companies that came under severe strain during the crisis, and their client firms, may have transmitted the financial crisis to nonfinancial companies  Using newly collected data, this thesis investigates whether corporations with close ties to trust companies were differentially affected during the panic.

Chocolate, a beloved sweet of the world, has stood center stage in power struggles and the conquest of the Americas, yet has also served to unite people and strengthen cultural identities  My research examines the shifting role of chocolate in Mexican society and religion, from pre-Hispanic to the present  In ancient Mesoamerica, chocolatesustenance for the body and soulwas an important religious offering, source of wealth, and determinant of social status  This drink of the gods was linked to blood, lust and the human life cycle  During the sixteenth century Spanish conquest of Mexico, chocolate served as a means of cultural exchange between the indigenous and European worlds  As the popularity of chocolate grew, so did debates surrounding the ecclesiastic and medical virtues (and vices) of chocolate  Though social codes and mystical beliefs surrounding chocolate gradually disseminated, chocolate remains important in Mexican identity and culture today.

How can a writer express social conflict and discontent under the censorship of a powerful dictator? What is the relationship between the internal changes and conflicts of literary characters and their physical environment? These questions form the foundation of my thesis project, which explores the complex function of space in four novels of the Spanish postwar period set in Barcelona  I examine the spatialization of the process of identity formation in these texts and the way in which conflict is embedded in the literary configuration of the city  These novels, too, are crucial to the identity formation of the city itself following the devastation of the Spanish Civil War and to establishing its place in the literary imagination of the twentieth century.

Gascon-Vera, Spanish My thesis focuses on many ways in which foreigners and immigrants are represented in contemporary Spanish film  Economic hardships have propelled many people from around the world to seek better lives in Europe, which has transformed Spain from a country of emigration into a country of immigration  This change has brought out feelings of suspicion and pronounced xenophobia throughout the nation  Through current Spanish films, I have studied this complex relationship within a broader political and economic context.

Olsen, Art, and Daniela Rivera, Art The year 1999 marked the beginning of the crisis in Zimbabwe, a ten-year period of socioeconomic decline and political turmoil that was chiefly set into motion by the unlawful seizures of commercially-owned farmland  The decade was characterized by political oppression, state-perpetrated human rights offences and an economic meltdown  This installation is an audio-visual meditation on this period: it juxtaposes state rhetoric with personal stories of experience and survival in Zimbabwe, where the government waged one of the most sustained propaganda campaigns in postcolonial Africa.

We pass the same people every day in class, in the bathroom, in the dining hall yet we dont always approach them and begin a conversation  Even when we want to make that connection, something stops us: the fear of being nosy or awkward or even too friendly  This art project came from a desire to connect with people, without the barrier of introductions  I interviewed Wellesley students and asked them to join me in painting a quick portrait of themselves, I then borrowed a meaningful object to paint in detail  The flatness and boundaries of a painted surface are limiting, thus I can only retain a small part of that object for myself  Similarly, portraits can never fully capture an individual, and empathy is not as attainable as we would like it to be.

Goldfish (Carassius auratus) have a unique ability to adapt to low oxygen conditions  In this experiment, we isolated cardiac tissue and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying acclimation to hypoxia  Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and gel electrophoresis, we compared gene expression for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1a), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and SUR2 in acclimated and non-acclimated goldfish  We found significant upregulation of HIF1a and NOS, but no significant change in SUR2 expression  Because HIF1a and NOS are regulatory factors involved in the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, significant upregulation suggests increased KATP channel activity  Because SUR2 codes for a structural subunit of KATP channels, no significant change suggests that KATP channel density is not affected.

Estradiol is an ovarian steroid hormone essential to reproductive function and requisite to various biological processes  Its release is regulated by an endocrine pathway initiated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is broken down by neuropeptidases thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) and prolyl endopeptidase (PEP)  We hypothesized that estradiol levels may correlate with or directly alter TOP and PEP, thereby explaining a role by which it regulates GnRH activity  In this study, fluorimetric activity assays were used to analyze how estradiol alters TOP and PEP enzymatic activity in several mouse brain regions involved in reproductive function  Immunohistochemical assays were also conducted to ascertain localization of TOP, PEP, and estradiol receptor alpha in order to observe how all three components influence each other in their expression and activity.

Radiation chemistry, the study of the interactions of high-energy radiation with matter, has extensive applications and implications in areas such as cancer treatment, waste management, astrochemistry, nuclear chemistry and the material sciences  The interaction of highenergy radiation with matter results in copious quantities of secondary low-energy electrons, which form distinct energetic species that are thought to promote a variety of radiation-induced chemical reactions  The majority of these secondary electrons have energies below 10 eV and react with matter through three mechanisms: (1) dissociative electron attachment (DEA), (2) electron impact excitation, and (3) electron impact ionization  Our goal is to examine the hypothesis that DEA is the primary dissociation mechanism for high-energy radiolysis in the condensed phase  We are studying the dynamics of low-energy electron-induced reactions in multilayer nanoscale thin films of methanol under ultrahigh vacuum conditions  Investigation of two new possible radiolysis products, methyl formate (CH3OCOH) and glycolaldehyde (HOCH2CHO) are also underway.

Spiroxin A, a natural compound isolated from a marine fungus, has shown promising cytotoxicity against ovarian cancer cells  Ovarian cancer is a serious disease that affects about one in 57 women in the US each year and is the most common cause of death from gynecological cancer  I will present the synthesis of a key chiral precursor en route to the synthesis of this promising anti-cancer agent  The new route will be applied towards the enantioselective total synthesis of spiroxin A and other structural analogues important for future structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies.

Chloroplast movement and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) via the pigment zeaxanthin are two mechanisms plants employ to optimize photosynthetic performance under changing light intensities  In order to determine the relative importance of both mechanisms in mitigating the degree of photoinhibition we quantified their roles in a wide array of plant species  Cytochalasin B (an actin-depolymerizing agent) and dithiothreitol (a violaxanthin de-epoxidase inhibitor) were used to inhibit chloroplast movement and prevent zeaxanthin synthesis, respectively  We then determined the extent of photoinhibition in the absence of these photoprotective mechanisms under high light stress conditions  Since internal CO2 concentrations are the other important factor in determining photosynthetic behavior, we investigated the relationship between stomatal density and chloroplast movement using confocal microscopy  Leave were fixed with glutaraldehyde to preserve chloroplast positioning and stained with propidium iodide, which allowed the visualization of the stomata.

Using a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified a threonine residue within a cyclindependent kinase (CDK) consensus motif in the S  cerevisiae protein Bni4 as a phosphorylation site that exhibited diminished modification when mitotic cyclins were depleted from the cytoplasm in G2/M-synchronized cells  We have previously characterized bud morphogenesis, cytokinesis, and cell wall integrity defects associated with cytoplasmic mitotic cyclin depletion  Bni4 is required for proper assembly of the chitin ring and is also involved in septum formation and the maintenance of bud neck integrity  We assessed the role of CDK1- mediated Bni4 phosphorylation in these processes by mutagenizing the target residue within the identified CDK target motif and testing the ability of the mutant protein to rescue the previously documented synthetic lethality of bni4bni1 double knockout cells.

An intriguing pattern has emerged in the Galpagos, where several endemic taxa display divergences older than the geological age estimates of the islands above water  Explanations of this discordance could invoke geological evidence of older, drowned islands as colonization platforms for ancestors, extending the time available for diversification  In contrast, such explanations are not required to reconcile divergence times with the islands age in other dynamic volcanic island systems  We will evaluate the relative contribution of extant versus disappearing platforms to the diversity of Galpagos endemic beetles through estimation of divergence times on a multiple-gene molecular phylogeny.

Chemists use an understanding of the structures and properties of biological molecules to develop treatments of diseases  We will discuss our work as chemists focusing on diabetes and chlamydia  Diabetes is a highly prevalent disease in the US  One project is examining the affinity of GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone integral to the insulin induction pathway, for its receptor GLP-1R, while another is looking at the structure of GLP-1R through its interactions with a small molecule inhibitor  Chlamydia is a common, recurring sexually-transmitted disease  We are synthesizing a molecule designed to allow patients to develop long-term immunity  Ultimately, the results will help develop better treatments for type 2 diabetes and chlamydia.

How much do children learn in school? What is the value of a rural education? Economists have dedicated significant resources to investigating these questions  We look to an experimental middle school program in Honduras designed for rural communities for answers  We consider a panel data set on a cohort of students from 54 primary schools intended to feed students into these experimental middle schools  Fourteen of these middle schools did not open due to an enrollment cutoff, providing us with exogenous variation in attendance  We administered an achievement test and survey to the students regardless of their attendance behavior, allowing us to consider the effects of this random variation in enrollment on student achievement and labor supply  Attempts to quantify the value added of these experimental, community-based, rural middle schools are underway.

Upon seizing power in a coup dtat in 1977, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq promised elections within 90 days  Eleven years later, Pakistanis were still waiting, and Zias regime only ended after his death in a mysterious plane crash  The longevity of Zias autocratic rule was largely possible due to his Islamization Project in which a series of punitive measuresincluding fundamentalist legislation towards womenwere implemented in the name of religion  The question remains: how did Zia achieve success in his Islamist project? Introducing his policies two years before Khomeinis return to Iran, Zia initiated his own Islamic revolution of sorts  Vowing to rescue Pakistan by aligning its society with the injunctions of Islam, Zia was able to present his actions as innately Pakistani and as continuous within the greater schema of Pakistans history.

The fight for equal marriage rights has dominated the contemporary gay movement  I aim to address the following questions through qualitative interviews with 15 married female couples in Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2004  Are female same-sex couples engaging in acts of resistance to produce a new type of wedding and a new model of marriage, or are they essentially reproducing a traditional and heterosexual model? Is the intention to subvert a norm an essential component of acts of resistance, or can non-normative behavior function as resistance without the consciousness of the actor? Is it possible to change an institution while participating in it, or must we dissent from and reject those institutions that we deem problematic in order to achieve more lasting transformations in society?.

What happens when students arrive at college and are met by peers from very different backgrounds? To what extent do institutional programs and policies (e g , curricular requirements, diversity initiatives) shape the diversity experiences of students? Through a qualitative analysis of interviews collected for the New England Consortium on Assessment and Student Learning (NECASL), I will explore how student experiences with diversity in a new environment relate to the development of their social identities  My presentation will compare student accounts from Wellesley College with those from a co-ed college in New England.

Gender Studies Lesbian separatism emerged as a political ideology during the early 1970s  Most lesbian separatist groups branched off from the womens liberation movement and created their own political stances to suit their needs that were not being met by womens liberation groups  Their stance during the 1970s was that by withdrawing their energy and support for men, they would be able to focus on creating a womens culture and simultaneously dissolve the patriarchy  Current lesbian separatist communities are often thought to be the vestige of a radical past, and they remain rarely heard from or studied  My ethnographic fieldwork within one of the largest remaining lesbian separatist communities revealed the political differences between early and current lesbian separatism  Some of the main political focuses include the importance of women-only spaces, aging, and sustainability.

Rhetoric, the art of eloquent persuasion, fascinated medieval Europeans  In the context of both performance and literature, they imbued music with rhetorical meaning, refuting modern scholarship that generally asserts that such meaning did not appear in Western music until the Renaissance  An understanding of the rhetorical potential of a piece offers insight into the musics purpose and the cultural background of the musician and audience  This presentation will feature a discussion on rhetoric in medieval musical pieces and literature  The sweetness of birdsong in Old French romances, the tragic love of Tristan and Isled, the mystical chant of Hildegard of Bingen, and the meticulous scholarship of thirteenth century Parisian scholars will shed light on the power of music to move human emotion  My performance on the vielle, harp, and hurdy-gurdy will be joined by bass voice to explore rhetorical music by Hildegard and several troubadours.

Thomas Mann stayed in the closet his entire life  He used his work, such as Death in Venice, to explore his secret desires  Vladimir Nabokov was a homophobe who hated Manns topical trash  His novel Pale Fire seems, at first, to correlate with his public aversion to homosexuality  Both authors, however, had more complex attitudes toward queer sexuality  These can be uncovered by examining the way they form their narratives  My work looks at how narrative strategy is used to shape the readers relationship with queer desire and, in doing so, uncovers the hidden affinities between these two complicated men.

Sciences, and Nolan T  Flynn, Chemistry Recent advances in nanotechnology have led to the use of nanoparticles as platforms for the attachment of targeting macromolecules, and a variety of cytotoxic chemicals to detect, target, and kill tumor cells  Through a collaborative effort between the Flynn, Kolodny, and Webb labs, we are developing a multipurpose nanovehicle for magnetic resonance imaging and targeted treatment of pancreatic cancer  We are decorating the surface of gold nanoparticles with stabilizing polymers, monoclonal antibodies directed against tumor biomarkers, and cytotoxic drugs for proof-of-concept testing with both in vitro and in vivo systems.

The North American continent is a mosaic of ancient continents accreted by tectonic collisions over the last four billion years  This project examines evidence for a three-billion-year- old tectonic collision preserved in granite plutons exposed in Yellowstone National Park  The project began last summer in Yellowstone with field observations and collection of rock samples for further study  It continued in the laboratory with microscopic examination of the spatial relationship between minerals in the rock and measurement of the U-Pb crystallization ages of the mineral zircon  The mineralogical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that these granite plutons formed by partial melting of metamorphosed sedimentary continental crust during and/or following collision, rather than by partial melting associated with subduction prior to collision  U-Pb dating of zircon crystals is underway to test this hypothesis.

Lamarck theorized that characteristics of species changed due to environmental conditions and that these changed characteristics were passed to offspring  Lamarcks theory of immediate environmental consequences to traits (acquired characteristics) may still offer some insight to transgenerational plant responses to the environment, within the context of Darwinian evolution  For many plants, it can be beneficial to be able to react to the environment as needed  However, some plants are better prepared for life due to the environmental conditions of their mother, and can gain an advantage over seeds that were not prepared for a certain environment  In order to better understand such transgenerational plasticity, and to determine whether or not it is adaptive, we are conducting a two-generational experiment on Persicaria lapathifolia, exploring how plant competition affects fitness across generations.

Green roofs, roofs that are planted with vegetation, are used to reduce the heat island effect and stormwater runoff in cities, but they are also a novel type of ecosystem that can support plants, insects, and birds  My research explored the factors that control biodiversity, particularly of arthropods, on green roofs  Certain ecological factors control green roof biodiversity, but it is also important to consider whether green roof designers have the knowledge to build green roofs that promote biodiversity, and how government regulations of green roofs impact the design and maintenance process  This talk will address the question: Given our knowledge of green roof ecology, from my work and previous research, how can green roof regulations be more biodiversity-friendly?.

Previous research has demonstrated that young children acquiring English are better able to reason about spatial relationships when they are given language that describes the spatial relation  We investigated the relationship between the acquisition of spatial language and the development of spatial relational reasoning in deaf children  American Sign Language (ASL) is distinct from English because of its visual-spatial nature  While English speakers use lexical prepositions such as in, on, and under, ASL signers use iconic depictions of spatial relations more than lexical prepositions to represent the real-world objects in relation to one another  Thus young ASL signers might use spatial language differently to facilitate their understanding of spatial relationships  Ten deaf children in an ASL-English preschool program completed two spatial mapping tasks that involved an understanding of similarity between two identical setups, a spatial language production task and a spatial language comprehension task  Childrens scores on the cognitive tasks were significantly correlated with the complexity of their spatial language production and with their comprehension of spatial language in ASL.

Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL) is a rapidly developing language that has recently incorporated grammatical markers produced on the face  When asking questions the youngest signers furrow their brows and lift their chins more than older signers, suggesting that younger signers are introducing these elements into NSL  The current empirical study examines whether these grammatical facial expressions are borrowed from the facial gestures produced by hearing Nicaraguans when asking questions  Twelve adult Nicaraguans with normal hearing and no experience with NSL were videotaped asking a friend a series of questions  We coded for three facial gestures: brow furrow, chin lift, and nose wrinkle  We observed the use of all three facial expressions, and documented the use of two more: side head tilt and brow raise  The similarity between the subset of facial expressions produced by both groups, confirms that grammatical markers in NSL are being adapted from some, but not all, of the gestures used by hearing Nicaraguans.

Workers in a honey bee colony are from numerous genetic families because each honey bee queen mates with multiple males  It is known that colonies with multiple subfamilies of workers forage more and produce longer waggle dances to advertise food sources in the environment; we determined some of the worker-level mechanisms that explain this phenomenon  We compared waggle dancing by foragers and the amount of pheromones that workers release as they dance to the genetic composition of colonies (i e , whether colonies were genetically diverse or genetically uniform because of the insemination status of queens)  Our findings will allow us to determine whether the multiple-mating behavior of honey bee queens improves a colonys foraging effort because individual workers in a genetically diverse colony produce more signals on a per worker basis than workers in a genetically uniform colony.

Bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, which inhabit the littoral and pelagic regions of Lake Waban, show differences in diet selection and feeding morphology dependent on environment  Our studies have found that littoral fish have wider mouths and a wider pharyngeal jaw apparatus compared to pelagic fish  This enables them to feed on larger and more complex prey items including snails (Gastropoda) and flies (Odonata, Diptera)  Pelagic fish feed almost exclusively on Daphnia  These results suggest that bluegill ecomorphs are better adapted to feed within their respective habitats.

The cues leading to an insects molt, shedding of skin, remain poorly understood  In Manduca sexta, it is known that the steroid hormone ecdysone initiates molting  However, the mechanism underlying its release is not known  To determine the role of nutrition in initiating endocrine changes, fourth instar Manduca larvae were fed diets either containing or missing certain macromolecules  Tryptophan, as well as all the other essential amino acids, was found to be necessary for molting  Starved animals were found to overcome inhibitions to molt through ecdysone injections  Rapamycin, an inhibitor of TOR signaling, an amino acid sensor, was found to delay a molt without reducing the growth rate  Investigations of the mechanism by which TOR signaling, amino acids, and ecdysone interact are currently underway.

The ovarian steroid hormones, estradiol (E) and progesterone, act in specific brain regions to regulate reproductive behavior and physiology  One function of E is the induction of progestin receptor (PR) expression in the brain, which is predominantly mediated by Estrogen Receptor- (ER)  E has more recently been found to also act via membrane ER and trigger rapid cellular events  The potential contribution of this novel mechanism of ER action to the expression of PR in the brain has not been investigated  To understand the role of membrane ER in estrogen signaling in vivo, a transgenic mouse expressing membrane only estrogen receptor- (MOER) was developed by Ellis Levin (Pedram et al, 2008)  MOER mice express only the ligand binding domain of ER at the plasma membrane  Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, the present study addresses two questions: 1) Do MOER mice express membrane ER in the brain? and 2) Do MOER mice express E-induced PR in the brain?.

Rett syndrome (RTT), a developmental neurological disorder, is the second leading cause of mental retardation in girls  Girls who have RTT appear to develop normally until 18 months of age when they begin to express symptoms of RTT, such as loss of speech, abnormalities in motor function, and severe respiratory dysfunction  Currently, there is no known cure for RTT  This study uses the noninvasive techniques of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and in vivo MR spectroscopy (MRS) to conduct longitudinal studies on Mecp2R168X, a mouse model of RTT  The main objective of this study aims to characterize the neurochemical profile and examine changes in brain structure volume of Mecp2R168X in vivo  If we can understand the neurochemical basis of RTT, we may be able to monitor, identify, and treat RTT patients via their neurochemical pathways.

Pancreatic cancer is a rare yet highly aggressive malignancy with a five-year survival rate of only 14% with no effective therapies  Our goal is to create a multipurpose nanoparticle for targeted delivery of imaging contrast and therapeutic agents for pancreatic cancer  The particles inner core consists of iron oxide, which allows us to visually track the particles using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as they reach the target tumor  Synthesized particles were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and MRI  The particles surface will be decorated with targeting antibodies and therapeutic agents  The therapeutic agent, a boron-10 loaded synthetic peptide, was characterized using ICP-OES and Western blots  Nanoparticle delivery will be tested using tumors grown on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken eggs  An analogous in ovo model using smaller quail eggs has also been developed.

Neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, occurs throughout adult life in organisms ranging from the humble fruit fly to the complex human  In the brain of the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, our lab has identified a neurogenic niche, or cluster of neural precursor cells, that serves as a hub for the development and migration of new neurons  Because all cells in the niche are migrating to their final destination in the brain, it remains a question how the niche is replenished with new precursor cells  Our current hypothesis suggests that hematopoietic stem cells are migrating from the bloodstream to the niche via a vascular cavity  We seek to characterize this cell migration from blood to brain noninvasively using superparamagnetic iron oxide particles and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that results in severe cognitive impairment and changes in neuroanatomy in humans  The GCPII+/- mouse model attempts to imitate schizophrenia symptoms by decreasing the levels of glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) in the brain  Decreased GCPII should then lead to decreased glutamate activity, which is thought to be a cause for human schizophrenia  Because magnetic resonance techniques are noninvasive, longitudinal studies are done to study mouse brain development over time  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to examine the volumes of whole brain and specific brain regions including the hippocampus and lateral ventricles, regions affected by schizophrenia in humans  Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows quantification of brain metabolites  By comparing mutant and normal control mice, we can assess whether or not the mouse model successfully emulates the changes in the brain that occur with schizophrenia.

Gender stereotypes continue to affect judgments about men and women, especially true in male-dominated fields where relatively few women reach high-ranking positions  Why are women so underrepresented in scientific fields? One possibility is that people assume that women lack the traits needed to be successful scientists  To test this, we investigated whether people associate success in the sciences with masculine traits more than feminine traits  We also assessed whether the association of masculine traits with scientific success was greater in some scientific fields than others  Because past research on stereotyping has shown that people tend to see occupations as requiring masculine traits to a greater extent when those occupations have a relatively high proportion of men, we predicted that stereotypes linking success in science to masculine traits would be most pronounced in sciences where there are relatively few women.

Previous research has found that college students with more severe post-reading binocular visual abnormalities reported more symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Wilmer and Buchanan, 2009)  We theorized that these visual abnormalities may cause ADHD symptoms by inducing visual stress during nearwork  In this study, we measured visual abnormalities with a battery of binocular vision tests both before and after a challenging reading comprehension test  We also assessed self-reported visual stress and a broad range of personality characteristics associated with ADHD  Individuals who reported more visual symptoms on the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) reported significantly higher ADHD symptoms on both the ADHD Index of the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales and the Nadeau College-level ADHD Questionnaire  We conclude that visual symptoms are highly, and specifically, predictive of ADHD symptoms  This relationship is consistent with our theory that binocular visual abnormality causes ADHD symptoms by inducing visual stress.

Large individual differences in the precision of smooth pursuit eye movements (the ability to smoothly track a moving object) raise the question of where these differences come from and whether they can be modified through experience  We examined the effects of video-game training on smooth pursuit precision by training 41 participants in one of three types of video games (sports, action, and strategy) for one hour a day for seven days  Results indicate that training in certain video games can improve smooth pursuit precision, which may be beneficial for people ranging from those with visual deficits to professional athletes.

Although smooth pursuit eye movements, used to follow a moving object, were presumably beneficial to those species that evolved them, we know little of their importance in modern society  Given that some people smoothly pursue moving objects more precisely than others, if precise smooth pursuit is important for a task, individuals with more precise pursuit should perform that task better  In order to investigate the potential importance of smooth pursuit, I studied smooth pursuit eye movements in relation to playing sports, in particular Ultimate Frisbee  I found that participants who played sports or watched sports on television had more precise smooth pursuit than those who did not  To measure smooth pursuit precision, participants pursued dot targets of various speeds while an eye tracker recorded their eye movements  Participants also answered questions about their experiences in sports and other activities involving vision.

The mechanisms by which the outputs of the L, M, and S cones are processed by the brain to produce color perception are incompletely known  The macaque has been used as a model for human color vision, but it remains unclear whether it has the same color perception as humans  Krauskopf et al  (1982) found that thresholds to colors along certain color axes were selectively elevated following adaptation to stimuli saturating those particular axes, while thresholds to intermediate colors were not elevated to the same degree following adaptation to saturated intermediate colors  Thus they concluded that there are two cardinal chromatic axes: L-M and S  We sought to investigate whether macaque monkeys have the same cardinal chromatic axes as humans  Sixteen hues were presented at various saturations while the subjects ability to detect the hue was measured under various adapting conditions  Preliminary results suggest that macaque monkeys have similar chromatic cardinal axes as human subjects.

Gender Studies Latinas do not comprise a homogeneous group of individuals  Instead, they span the range of professions, nationalities, education levels, age, class, and even race  The aim of my research is to address the ways this diversity shapes individual Latinas experiences with work and family, with a focus on how employment and family life come to interact and intersect  I draw on in-depth interviews that I conducted with Latinas from Southern California  I will discuss their employment histories, and the intersections with family life, in the context of their diverse backgrounds.

The limits and possibilities of multiculturalism in community life remain deeply contested on college and university campuses  Research on campus diversity from the past two decades have suggested that while institutions are drawing an increasingly heterogeneous pool of students, they are likewise experiencing the cleaving of university spaces into racial-ethnic enclaves  Using 640 surveys from Wellesley seniors and sophomores and in-depth interviews with student organizational leaders, my thesis explores racial bridging and bonding on campus: Does an environment as diverse as Wellesley necessarily translate into healthy cross-cultural exchange, or is diversity counteracted by self-segregation? This study investigates the extent to which pre-college experiences and attitudes surrounding race influence a students propensity for multiracial friend groupsa finding that can inform the development of institutional policies aimed at nurturing more intergroup linkages.

In recent years, issues of immigration have increasingly shaped social and political discourses around the world  Immigrant groups have been met with growing hostility in nations worldwide, and have been repeatedly characterized as a threat to society by individuals and political parties  This trend is particularly evident in Austria, where anti-immigration and anti-immigrant sentiment has increasingly shaped public debates and become an important political issue  The Austrian Freedom Party (FP), in particular, has both exploited and contributed to political and social tensions over issues of immigration  In doing so, the FP has employed extremist, anti-Muslim and xenophobic language, and has drawn upon notions of an imagined and exclusively Austrian cultural identity and history to frame immigration discourse in Austria.

In 2000, the Nisgaa Final Agreement came into force and created an unprecedented form of aboriginal self-government in Canada  The Nisgaa nations experiment with a third order government is an example of Canadas liberal commitment to accommodating the minority group needs of its multicultural citizenry  But questions remain in theory and practice: is aboriginal self-government a form of cultural accommodation compatible with liberal political theory and is it constitutional in Canada? The debate centers on whether sovereign aboriginal nations can be born from aboriginal treaty rights protected in the Canadian Constitution, and highlights the threat of the Nisgaa Constitution upon the Canadian Constitutions supremacy  This debate grapples with a rights-centric liberal political paradigm, as not all aboriginal peoples subscribe to this political paradigm and have different interpretations of nationhood and citizenship.

Berman, Art In the summer of 1953, one could hardly call Merce Cunninghams group of dancers a company in the formal sense of the term  At the time it was only one of many protean artistic experiments taking shape at Black Mountain College, a hotbed of intellectual activity where artists ideas circulated freely across the disciplines of music, dance, and the visual arts  Black Mountain fostered a collaborative setting for some of the most important creative minds of the second half of the twentieth century, yet during that summer their place in the American artistic pantheon was far from guaranteed  My thesis explores Cunninghams unlikely trajectory in becoming a cultural icon through an analysis of his aesthetic, networks, and funding  The project attempts to address the question of how this marginal experiment came to represent twentieth century American dance.

While the historical and religious roots of kaji kito ("ritual prayer") lay in Tibetan tantric and Chinese Buddhist practices, the most direct influence of kaji kito in Nichiren Shu Buddhism, a Japanese Buddhist sect founded by the Buddhist monk, Nichiren (12221282), comes from Shingon and Tendai Buddhism, two Japanese Buddhist traditions that precede Nichiren's time  The ritualistic aspect of the term "kaji" suggests divine bestowal, which can also be explained in the context of Shinto, an indigenous practice of worshipping kami (spiritual deities)  However, the hidden nature of this practice evokes mysticism, often leading to its incorrect interpretations  The presentation will not only look at the historical development, but also the meaning of kaji kito both during and after Nichiren's time, including the physical practice of kaji kito called aragyo, a 100day ascetic practice undergone annually in Japan by some Nichiren Shu priests.

Wenzhou's experience of development has become a nationally acclaimed development model, following successful growth in what was once an impoverished village  The Wenzhou model is known for its emphasis on small businesses, commodity industries, and the unique relationship between the local government and private entrepreneurs  This thesis focuses on a lesser-known aspect of Wenzhou, the impact of Protestant and Confucian culture on a new wave of entrepreneurs, known as "boss Christians" in China  Based on in-depth interviews with Christian CEOs and government officials, this thesis suggests evidence for the positive impact of religious values on business ethics and relations with the government.

Metamorphosis is a drastic change in form between juvenile and adult life stages that occurs in many organisms  Although this change in form is often thought of as a process that occurs primarily in insects, humans also undergo a less drastic transition during puberty  The hormonal basis of metamorphosis and puberty are very similar in that both are initiated and regulated by neurohormones of the brain  In vertebrates, POU domain transcription factors (TF) have been linked to neuroendocrine changes associated with puberty  In order to better understand the processes of metamorphosis and puberty, we are investigating the function of a homolog of the POU domain TF, ventral veins lacking (vvl), found in the holometabolous insect, Tribolium castaneum  The link between vvl and key insect hormones, including the steroid hormone ecdysone and juvenile hormone, will be discussed.

In order to grow, insects must replace their old skin with a bigger one in a process called molting  Although it is known that the increased secretion of the steroid hormone ecdysone triggers molting, the factors responsible for this hormonal change remain poorly understood  To determine what nutritional cues initiate molting, fourth instar Manduca sexta larvae were fed modified diets  Amino acids were found to be necessary for molting  Additionally, when larvae were fed rapamycin, an inhibitor of an amino acid sensitive pathway, the timing of the molt was affected  Studies on the molecular changes associated with the disruption of this pathway are underway.

Because of their size, nanomaterials exhibit many novel properties that make them potentially useful for applications in medicine, materials science, electronics, and alternative energy  Our lab is currently using nanomaterials for several of these applications  We are creating chemically functionalized nanoparticles for both diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer  We are also developing an electrochemically-triggered assembly method of nanoparticles for applications in sensing and information storage  Finally, we are studying the stability of nanoparticle thin films on various substrates, which have utility in biological or chemical sensing.

Population-centric counterinsurgency theory, advanced by the U S  militarys 2006 Field Manual 324, dictates that U S  forces must engage local populations to effectively combat insurgencies  Since 2009, the United States has increasingly employed Female Engagement Teams (FETs) in Afghanistan to gain access to the female population  Proponents of the program argue that winning over women is essential for building local confidence and gaining access to information, and in turn suppressing the insurgency  While the FET program is frequently upheld as a proven concept, I argue that this conclusion has been reached simply because the program corresponds with the doctrinal model promoted by FM 324  The contribution of the FET program to quelling the insurgency in Afghanistan has not been critically examined, a reflection of the militarys reluctance to test its own assumptions about the utility of population-centric COIN in the country.

Women are much more likely than men to interrupt their work careers for family reasons, a pattern which contributes to both the commonly referenced gender wage gap between men and women, as well as the family wage gap between women with and without children  Although most developed countries have instituted government mandated maternity leaves meant to protect women in the workplace and at home, the United States has yet to pass legislation that mandates maternity leaves for all women  Using the variation provided by state-level policies as well as the federal Family and Medical Leave Act passed in 1993, this research focuses on the effect of parental leave on labor market outcomes resulting from mandated maternity leaves in order to determine if they indeed protect womens positions on the career-ladder or cause them to miss out on crucial labor market opportunities.

Sciences Food abundance limits the reproductive success of Neotropical migrant songbirds breeding in northern hardwood forests, Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire  Caterpillars are their primary food source, and it is difficult to count caterpillars directly  Consequently, herbivory may be a means of indexing caterpillar abundance  We predicted that more caterpillars would be found where it is warmer (e g , low elevation, in forest tree-fall gaps) or where foliar nitrogen is greatest (i e , high elevation, in forest tree-fall gaps)  9:3010:40am 11am12:10pm We found that herbivory differed between low and high elevation plots and between tree species but not between forest gap and interior areas.

Modern Spanish cities have used different strategies to confront the combined challenges presented by rapid changes in urbanization, demographics and lifestyles since the death of Franco and the arrival of democracy (1975)  This presentation will explore urban policies employed in Cordoba and Barcelona in the post-Franco period to foster community and to solve space and quality of life problems in high-density areas  Particular attention will be devoted to the role of public investment in urban regeneration projects  By size and location these two cities can be used as case studies to better understand different options for urban renewal  Barcelona is a large cosmopolitan city in the North of Spain and Cordoba is a medium-sized city in the South.

Gender Studies While feminist bioethicists have built consensus around the need to analyze intersecting identities along the lines of race, class, and gender, the role of age has been relatively untheorized  The lack of age consideration reflects oppression in the form of marginalization, which challenges elderly womens right to be heard  Adapting the framework of reproductive justice, I develop a notion of aging justice specific to elderly Korean American women  To understand what is necessary for aging justice, I refine feminist theory on aging by valuing the lived experiences of Korean American women and their articulations of aging with dignity and respect  Listening to the voices of those with the most intimate knowledge of their oppression enriches theory by allowing for a more culturally and contextually appropriate vision of aging justice.

Worldwide the microfinance sector has opened the path between the underserved populations in developing countries and the global financial system  By providing the underserved populations access to basic financial services, microenterprises have sought to liberate the poor from the entrapping cycle of poverty and equip them with the financial resources to work their way up the economic ladder  Yet the question remains: Are basic financial services enough? At ACCION International, a non-profit microfinance organization, entrepreneurship and financial education have become a key non-financial component of poverty alleviation and empowerment  Our understanding of the development and impact of Actions educational programs will be presented.

The enzyme thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is present throughout the body and acts on many substrates, including neuropeptides that affect production of hormones such as estrogens and androgens  In order to study TOP in systems of hormone regulation, we have treated prostate cancer cells with three different hormones: dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and 1:302:40pm gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)  The effects of these treatments on changes in TOP levels and location in the cells may help demonstrate what TOPs role is in such systems  To date, we have found an increase in TOP in the prostate cells after incubation with both dihydrotestosterone and estradiol, and little effect with GnRH treatment  Estradiol treatment also appears to increase nuclear TOP.

Epigenetics is an up and coming field that investigates heritable changes in gene expression that are a result of our environment and, in many cases, our culture and lifestyle  In an effort to look at the current obesity epidemic from multiple disciplines, this thesis encompassed both a biological and an anthropological study  The biological aim was to investigate the environmental factors that influence the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of obesity  The field of epigenetics is also changing many of the ways we think about inheritance, identity, our environment, disease and preventative healthcare  Taking obesity as an example, this presentation will also cover the intertwining of culture and health in the epigenetic era.

Speech rhythm is critical to understanding spoken word  In fact, it is one of the first features infants learn about their native language (Ramus, 2000)  For my project I investigated the potential role of speech rhythm in second language acquisition  Nine native English speakers, each with an average of 3  years of German language training, were presented with recordings of sentences in German  These sentences had either natural, German-specific speech rhythm or were spoken to a regular beat  Results showed that when participants repeated these German sentences they less often made consonant-intrusion errors when sentences were presented with their natural rhythm  This finding suggests that language learning may be facilitated by language-specific speech rhythm.

How is a sensory stimulus translated into perception? Where does this translation occur? We began to answer these questions in rats by recording action potentials from neurons in the frontal and parietal cortices, both of which have been implicated in different aspects of sensory stimulus recognition in primates  Previous studies have produced conflicting results regarding the location of neurons associated with behavioral detection, as opposed to encoding of stimulus parameters  To address this issue, we analyzed the extent to which neurons in each cortex accurately reflected behavioral detection and presence of target stimuli while rats performed an auditory detection task, and whether the activity of these same neurons was modulated by sensory parameters of the target stimulus  Our preliminary results suggest that the sensory detection network in rat cortex may be less functionally segregated than in the primate brain.

Attention research has drawn a distinction between bottom-up attention, which is elicited by inherently salient stimuli (e g  a siren or flashing light) and top-down attention, which is internally driven (e g  looking for your keys)  Oscillatory power and coherence in the gamma range (30100 Hz), generated by the synchronized firing of many neurons, have been implicated in both bottom-up and top-down attentional processing  The purpose of my thesis is to determine if increased gamma power and coherence between the frontal and parietal cortex correlate with attention in rats  Local field potentials were recorded from these two cortical areas as rats listened to frequent and rare auditory stimuli (bottom-up attention) or performed a single-tone detection task (top-down attention)  Our preliminary results support that increased frontal-parietal gamma coherence and power are associated with top-down attentional processing.

Currently, biological researchers wade through huge heterogeneous data sets in a tedious, mostly individual routine  Our research seeks to improve the scientific process by facilitating collaboration and improving productivity  G-nome Surfer Pro is a multi-touch tabletop application that streamlines work-flow, giving researchers a means of organizing genomic information from many sources  GreenTouch is a collaborative mobile and a tabletop environment for improving data collection, encouraging sharing and comparison of the collected data  We will discuss the design and development of these tools, and we will review our research findings.

Economists study voting behavior for numerous reasons, one of which is to assess how people respond to incentives  If an incumbent government implements a program to transfer money back to tax-payers, is there a greater likelihood of re-election? Does the effect persist in subsequent elections? I address some of these questions empirically by studying a conditional cash transfer program, the Programa de Asignacion Familiar (PRAF), implemented by the Honduran government  The random assignment of the program to 40 of 70 eligible municipalities, together with municipal-level voting data from pre- and post-PRAF elections, allows us to estimate the causal effect of the 1:302:40pm program on various political outcomes  This study will allow us to test how incumbents are rewarded for benefits given to citizens, and enhance our understanding of voter behavior.

Why are some excellent at judging a persons emotional state, while others find it more difficult? My thesis research, building off a study I conducted last year, seeks to answer this question  I examined how different aspects of self-concept, such as extraversion, empathy, and private self-consciousness relate to the perception of facial expressions  In addition, I looked at how social behaviors and attitudes, such as social group size preference, relate to how accurately a person perceives facial expressions  Come to my talk and learn which aspects of self-concept, social behaviors, and social attitudes predict good perception of others facial expressions.

Barbara Beatty, Education Due to advances in technology, deaf children are now eligible to receive cochlear implants at an earlier age  While there is extensive information on the positive effects of cochlear implantation on their oral language development, not much is known about their social-emotional development  To learn more about curricular approaches to fostering social-emotional development in deaf children with and without cochlear implants, I interviewed teachers and administrators to identify their successful classroom strategies for promoting social-emotional and language development and their challenges  I also documented the physical set-up of classrooms, classroom schedules, and how children use space during play  As a second component to this study, I am developing a questionnaire for parents to measure deaf childrens quality of life  The findings of this study will be valuable for early interventionists, doctors, and parents of deaf children.

Early in development, children learn countless symbols  Adults take advantage of one characteristic inherent to many symbols in the manual modality- iconicity  Iconicity, the relationship between a symbols form and its meaning, is a natural part of sign languages  We tested hearing and deaf children learning ASL on their ability to recognize the iconic relationship between signs and their referents and investigated whether children learn iconic signs better than non-iconic ones  Exploring childrens use of iconicity informs our understanding of symbolic development as well as how children acquiring a language with iconicity interpret iconic symbols.

Joseph Boesenberg, American Museum of Natural History Howardite meteorites contain a mixture of crustal materials that have long been thought to be composed of fragments from a global mix of localities from the asteroid Vesta  Our work, however, suggests that most howardites consist of locally-mixed samples  Electron microscope X-ray element maps were made to determine the spatial distribution of the minerals in four howardites  The mineral distributions from the large clasts and mineral fragments were compared to the distributions in the small clasts and mineral fragments  Under normal conditions in a well-mixed rock, the mineral proportions in each size fraction should be approximately equal  In addition, chemical analysis of the mineral pyroxene in each meteorite was performed  The analysis shows whether pyroxene crystallized from a single magma or more than one and was subsequently mixed together and contains distinct populations  I will report on my results.

Universal cycles address questions in the field of discrete mathematics  They are one of the oldest mathematical objects, arising in diverse contexts: the creation of Sanskrit memory wheels, digital fault testing, pseudo-random number generation, modern public-key cryptography, and even mind-reading illusions  The idea of a universal cycle is to create a compact list of information within a string of characters  Existence results for universal cycles maximize efficiency, particularly in the expanding areas of encryption and data storage  I am exploring creating universal cycles of size-k subsets of the integers {1, 2,  , n}.

This presentation explores childbirth narratives of Tibetan exiles living in India  In India, women seek biomedical obstetric care; in Tibet, most women give birth at home  Biomedical hegemony, kinship, and citizenship shape this dynamic  In Tibet, a mistrust of Chinese hospitals due to coercive reproductive regulation discourages women from accessing biomedical care  However, these anxieties come into tension with experiences of birth complications at home  In India, this tension is eased, since women emphasize their freedom to access reproductive health care  And, given the absence of kin networks to aid women throughout labor, many give birth in hospitals  By juxtaposing memories of childbirth in Tibet with experiences of childbirth in exile, my informants' narratives point to the ways that reproduction figures as a symbol used to interpret ethnic, political, and familial belonging.

Chemistry The interactions of high-energy radiation with matter produces large numbers of low-energy secondary electrons, which are thought to initiate radiolysis reactions in the condensed phase  Using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), we have investigated the radiolysis products formed by low-energy (< 20eV) electron-induced reactions in condensed methanol under ultrahigh vacuum conditions  In contrast to temperature programmed desorption (TPD), a post-irradiation technique we have used previously, IRAS does not require thermal processing prior to product detection  Our goal is to simulate processes which occur when high-energy cosmic rays interact with interstellar ices, where methanol, a precursor of several prebiotic species, is abundant  The results of experiments such as ours may provide a fundamental understanding of how complex molecules are synthesized in the interstellar medium.

and Donna Patterson, Africana Studies Julius Malema is perhaps one of the most contentious figures in modern South African politics  He is beloved by the ANC's grassroots base of poor and underprivileged South Africans and he is simultaneously ridiculed and disdained by South Africa's politically powerful elites  My paper argues that Malema's rise to power has been prompted by distinct factors such as a vacuum of leadership within the ANC, service delivery issues as well as dissatisfaction amongst the country's youngest generations and the poor  Julius Malema is a major public figure in South Africa; he has the ability to stir the poor majority into a potentially violent revolt against the status quo  The rise of Julius Malema as a popular political figure illustrates deeper issues within the South African political and economic climate and the country's desire for tangible change.

Social media has transformed the political landscape of elections; it has become the ultimate democratic tool, allowing millions to make their voices heard  My presentation offers an overview of the findings from my thesis, which focuses on the impact of social media on grassroots political organizing  It includes historical research on the rise of social media, analysis of field data gathered during the 2008 Obama Campaign, interviews with my colleagues from the Obama Campaign, and illuminating anecdotes from my own experiences as a Field Organizer  My thesis aims to offer a new understanding of how political organizing has changed, for better or worse, as a result of the advent of social media.

Ted Gibson, Brain and Cognitive Sciences (MIT) The noisy channel model of language predicts that in human cognition, boundaries between syntax and semantics are less important than a listeners ability to infer an utterances meaning  Because neural activity generates voltage changes on the scalp, researchers can use this electrical activity to gain insight into cognition  Similar events generate characteristic voltage changes, called event-related potentials (ERP)  For example, the P600 ERP component has historically been identified with syntactic processing  However, the noisy channel model deemphasizes syntax, and so predicts the cognitive activity generating the P600 is not processing syntax but rather inferring meaning when an utterance is likely an error  I have recorded ERPs evoked by sentences with the last word replaced by a phonologically similar word likely to be an error  This presentation will describe these results and their implications for language.

Yoshihisa Matsusaka, History Today, China prides itself as a nation of fifty-six officially-recognized ethnic groups, including ten predominantly-Muslim ethnicities  Of the ten, the most populous are the Huizu or Sino-Muslims  Yet Huizu did not always exist as an ethnic category  As China transitioned from empire to modern nationstate in the twentieth century, new forms of identity emerged  Sino-Muslim intellectuals held different views about whether all Muslims in China comprised one nationality or were ethnically different while sharing one common religion  This internal debate provides the key to understanding how the terms Hui and Huizu underwent the curious transformation from a religious to an ethnic marker  Reevaluating Hui agency, my research examines the strategies used by Sino-Muslims to construct their collective identity and how these active efforts, in addition to state actions, contributed to the eventual recognition of an autonomous Hui nationality.

Anti-Chinese sentiment pervaded late 19th century U S  society  Chinese people in America faced discriminatory economic, social, and legal policies, which culminated in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882  This federal law targeted the Chinese as the first group for immigration and citizenship exclusion  My project builds upon historical studies about anti-Chinese racism and exclusion by addressing the creation of a problematic police force, the Chinatown Squad, which marked a racialized people and neighborhood for surveillance and discipline  The inauguration of the Chinatown Squad reflected important shifts in the policies of the municipal government and the San Francisco Police Department  Examining the expansion of the police force in the name of public safety alongside the municipally-directed policing of a racialized neighborhood will complicate our historical understanding of anti-Chinese rhetoric and violence.

Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric condition marked by severe cognitive impairments, brain anatomy alterations, and abnormal neurotransmitter activity  This study uses the genetically modified GCPII+/- mouse model, which has reduced glutamate carboxypeptidase II enzyme activity to mimic the hypoglutamatergic pathways observed in schizophrenia  The longitudinal portion of this study employs the non-invasive techniques of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS)  MRI is used to examine the volumes of brain structures affected by schizophrenia in humans  MRS is used to measure neurometabolite levels in the brain  Another portion of this study investigates the social behavior of normal and GCPII+/- mice using behavioral paradigms  By comparing the developmental brain structural volume, metabolite levels, and sociability of normal and GCPII+/- mice we can determine if this model is a successful model for schizophrenia.

Barbara Beltz, Neuroscience The birth of new neurons in the adult brain has been discovered in organisms ranging from humans to the crayfish  A cluster of neural precursor cells residing in a "neurogenic niche" has been identified in our animal model, the crayfish Procambarus clarkii  However, because all daughter cells from the niche migrate away to their final destinations in the brain, an extrinsic source of neural precursors must exist, although its identity remains unknown  By employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we are evaluating our hypothesis that hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) serve as neural precursors in adult neurogenesis  The migration of cells is observed through the MRI tracking of superparamagnetic iron oxide particle (SPIO) labeled hemocytes from Procambarus clarkii  To increase the efficiency of visualizing cell migration, techniques to isolate a candidate neuronal precursor cell type, the semi-granular cells, are being developed.

Nolan Flynn, Chemistry, and Andrew Webb, Biological Sciences Given their small size, low toxicity, and convenient surface chemistry, nanoparticles (particles hundreds of thousands times smaller than a dust mite) have emerged as effective platforms for developing a new generation of targeted biomedical therapies for cancer  Our goal is to create a multifunctional nanoparticle that can 4:305:40pm 1) target tumor cells, 2) kill cancerous cells, and 3) be visualized using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  Building on previous studies, work is being done to optimize the synthesis of a protective coating around the nanoparticles iron oxide core, which enables its use as a MRI tracking agent  Future work will focus on attachment of anti-cancer moieties onto the particles coating and in vivo testing on a mouse model.

Sharon Gobes, Neuroscience Songbirds, zebra finches in particular, provide an especially useful cognitive model for the acquisition of human speech due to the many parallels between bird song and human speech  One of the most notable similarities we share with songbirds is a sensitive learning period dependent on auditory experience and feedback  Our laboratory is conducting a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed at identifying the areas of the brain involved in song acquisition in our model organism, Taeniopygia guttata  With our micro-MRI system we have acquired well-resolved anatomical images of anesthetized birds  Our investigation of various pulse sequences will enable effective use of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI and other potential imaging techniques  Other challenges in this new study include recording and play-back of sound in the MRI for our preliminary experiments and developing an experimental paradigm appropriate for this unique study.

Organic chemistry provides us with the tools to control many biological functions  Our lab is interested in interactions of organic molecules with specific biological systems  We will discuss a range of problems including Chlamydia, diabetes, and the bonding behavior of organic ions in solution  The first project is focused on synthesizing a molecule designed to allow patients to develop long-term immunity to Chlamydia  The second project will result in the synthesis of an analog of a small molecule inhibitor to examine the three-dimensional structure of GLP-1R, the protein in the pancreas that initiates insulin production  The third is designed to develop an understanding of the interactions of charged organic molecules with solvents, since many biological interactions are based on intermolecular interactions with charged organic species  Ultimately, the results will help develop better treatments for Type II Diabetes and Chlamydia.

for Women The 2008 mortgage crisis was a harsh wakeup call to a mortgage market that had turned into a financial nightmare  Individuals across the U S  bought homes that they could not afford and they sacrificed their financial security by depleting their assets and increasing their debt  This study is focused on establishing these trends  The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health provides a nationally representative sample of participants in four stages  The most recent stage was collected in 2008 at what time participants were ages 2432 and provided information on social, economic, and physical wellbeing  By documenting factors such as mortgage, income and debt, economic wellbeing plays a central role in the understanding of the financial decisions that lead to the mortgage crisis.

In recent years, scientific research has placed an emphasis on the nanoscale  Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are extremely small gold particles with a diameter on the scale of nanometers that have myriad applications in medicine, biosensing, and electronics  Recently, there has been an increased interest in developing methods aimed at linking two distinct AuNP populations  The Flynn lab is developing a novel eletrochemical method to trigger the self-assembly of AuNPs  To maximize the use of electrochemistry, the AuNP populations should exhibit water-solubility  The Carrico-Moniz lab is working towards the synthesis of a novel thiolated compound that will be attached to AuNPs  This organic molecule incorporates several ethylene glycol units, which should enhance the water solubility of the respective AuNPs  The progress towards the synthesis of this novel sulfur-containing electroactive compound will be presented.

In 17th-century England, descriptions of the cosmos were in flux  Explorers, immigrants and colonists were re-defining the global map; local surveyors and cartographers were re-fixing the boundaries of villages and home- towns; early scientists were re-discovering the human body, calling into question older conceptions of how the universe functioned, and humankind within it  Examining poems of love, politics, faith and real estate, this project compares and contrasts John Donne and Andrew Marvell, two distinct and masterful poets, in their creation of geographical metamorphosis and reactive space within their literary works to offer a microcosmic portrait of the world.

Stereopsis is a binocular cue to depth, calculated using the disparity between images projected on each retina  In the 1960s, Hubel and Wiesel identified neurons selective for this disparity in macaque monkeys, but a full account of the work was never published: the cells lay in Area 18, a region whose organization was then poorly understood  Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we generated an atlas of macaque visual areas that we aligned with histological sections from Hubel and Wiesels experiments on stereopsis  Collaborating with Hubel and Wiesel and guided by their laboratory notes, we located most of their original recording sites, allowing us to place their findings in new context with contemporary results.

Characterized by constant scheduling, studying, and social interactions, Wellesley's unique environment fosters a culture of self-actualization in which discovering and achieving our perceptions of success stands at the cornerstone  This project attempts to visually portray the flux between hope and despair, satisfaction and shame in the lives of Wellesley students  Beginning with a scheme to deconstruct unfounded preconceptions of beauty within the ideological realm of Wellesley, the artist realizes that her project scope must widen to include a topic representing her own dreams: expelling human rights violations in North Korea  Paintings of Wellesley women, nude, vulnerable, and on the brink of initiation into an unforgiving world, are juxtaposed against portraits of North Koreans, depicting the clash between our quests to solidify our self-images at Wellesley and North Korean refugees struggle for survival and against injustice  Startling, bemusing, and unapologetically honest, this is an artist's undertaking to envelop and evolve her personal battles and convictions in her studio.

The Wellesley Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab is dedicated to innovation and investigation of next generation technology  Throughout the summer and fall semester, student researchers in the lab have developed software suites to enhance collaborative, inquiry based learning in Biology  This presentation will focus on the design, implementation, and evaluation of four research projects: GreenTouch, a collaborative environment for engaging novices in scientific inquiry; MoClo, a multitouch interface for biological design; SynFlo, an interactive installation for exposing non-scientists to basic synthetic biology concepts; and lastly SynBio Search, a semantic search engine for synthetic biology research.

Neonatal stroke is a major cause of infant death and permanent neuropsychological injury  Recently, the early response gene verge has been identified as highly active in the adult mouse brain post-stroke and during angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels  Verge mRNA expression increases threefold in the affected hemisphere of mice  In this study, 10-day-old mice with the verge gene (wild-type) and those without (knock-out) were used as a model of the human infant to test the hypothesis that verge improves stroke outcomes and angiogenesis in the ipsilateral hemisphere  Immunofluorescence studies were conducted to measure expression of CD105, an angiogenesis marker, and cresyl violet staining was performed to measure brain atrophy at different time points post-stroke  Verge knock-out brains retained a cyst while wild type brains experienced less damage, suggesting that verge serves as a neuroprotective agent in stroke.

Many bacterial species, including the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp  Strain PCC 6803, use the formation of biofilms as a survival mechanism  Biofilms are cell aggregates, which act as a protective barrier by providing nutrient access, increased drug tolerance and metabolic by-product sharing  Biofilms can form both in nature and in human infections, where they are very antibiotic resistant and thus particularly difficult to treat  To form biofilms, many bacterial species use a communication system involving chemical signals  In this study, we investigate the cell-cell communication of this cyanobacterium  The physical structure of the biofilms is also being analyzed  The wild type non-motile cells form a uniform monolayer biofilm while the super-motile mutant cells form pillar shaped biofilms that spread across the surface  Our goal is to gain a better understanding of this ubiquitous and diverse bacterial survival strategy.

Angelmarin, a coumarin-based compound, is a natural product that was isolated from the root of the Japanese medicinal plant Angelica pubescens, and has been found to display promising activity against the pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line PANC-1  Given this compounds potential as a pancreatic anticancer agent, structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies have been initiated to discover more effective analogs and to identify the compounds molecular target  These initial SAR studies led to the discovery of a novel geranylgeranylated ether coumarin derivative as a new lead structure  Cytotoxicity data for a novel lead series against PANC-1 cells under nutrient-rich and nutrient-deprived conditions will be presented  This project was done in collaboration with Professor Andrew Webb, Biology.

The low survival rate and lack of surgical options for many cancer patients has necessitated the development of highly specific and potent potential drug therapies  Nanoparticles, spherical particles with diameters an order of magnitude smaller than wavelengths of visible light, are ideal for cancer therapeutics due to their small size, low toxicity, and high surface area to volume ratios  Our project focuses on the surface modification of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles to achieve biocompatibility and targeted drug delivery  Nanoparticles are characterized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine their quality as contrast agents for tracking in vivo  Recent work has focused on coating iron oxide particles with silica and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to increase bio-compatibility along with the conjugation of nanoparticles to monoclonal antibodies for targeting pancreatic cancer cells.

One percent of the global population suffers from Schizophrenia, a chronic brain disorder that leads to behavioral, cognitive and social abnormalities  Although no specific cause has been identified, environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors have been implicated as possible factors  Our study attempts to validate a genetic and epigenetic mouse model for schizophrenia, GCPII/AAV  These mice have a genetic mutation that is hypothesized to cause diminished levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate, in hopes of modeling glutamate receptor dysfunction  We introduced a histone deacetylase enzyme to newborn mice to elicit epigenetic dysregulation  Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Diffusion Tensor Imaging are used to examine volumes of brain regions and the structural integrity of white matter tracts  A behavioral paradigm is also employed to test the mices sociability  Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy was used to analyze neurometabolite levels.

Songbirds provide a particularly useful cognitive model for human vocal learning and memory acquisition due to many established developmental, physiological, and genetic parallels with humans  Our work uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the process of vocal learning in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)  fMRI allows us to locate the neuronal response to an auditory stimulus in real time  Because this method is noninvasive, it permits longitudinal studies  Our efforts thus far have focused on developing the appropriate methods for fMR image acquisition and auditory management in songbird applications  These efforts include preliminary functional imaging experiments to investigate song learning in juvenile zebra finches.

The term Art Deco refers to a group of artistic works created between the two World Wars (from 1918 to 1939). While the Roaring Twenties represented the dawn of a glorious new age of prosperity and technological innovation, artists looked back upon history with nostalgia.  They fused aesthetics from around the world with contemporary elements to forge a style moderne. This negotiation between future and past resonates throughout fashion photography and architecture. In the work of Horst P. Horst (1906-1999) for Vogue magazine, Horst photographed glamorous models meant to elicit envy and desire in the American consumer.  The Chrysler Building, completed by William Van Alen,  also helped to sell the modern lifestyle. Thus, through the manipulation of popular imagery, corporations tried to create fantasies that catered to popular tastes: Art Deco was the ideal style in which to present these new messages.

Long-term monitoring is needed to identify the annual and decadal shifts in abundance of fish communities in response to natural ocean processes, as well as, climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. CALCOFI-the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations program-is virtually unique in using fish larvae surveys to follow trends in regional fish communities. There is need to monitor fish communities elsewhere, but the expense of large sampling programs like CALCOFI and the concern that reduced sampling programs may not be able to capture the same trends in abundance as large programs due to the patchy distribution of fish larvae has prevented their establishment. Using principal component analysis, I evaluated the potential of smaller sampling programs to capture the dominant trends in the annual mean abundance of key fish species and multivariate (community) trends in abundance by analyzing transects and time series of varying length.

 With famous lines like “On, on, you noblest English!,” and “This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,” Shakespeare’s plays—especially the histories— are famous for their role in creating and glorifying English national identity. But equally important to an understanding of Shakespeare’s canon are minority British identities, and of these the most prevalent and most overlooked are the Welsh. This presentation will focus on Shakespeare’s Welsh characters, their roles and presentations, and in focusing on Sir Hugh Evans from The Merry Wives of Windsor, will argue that there is a powerful duality of the foreign and familiar, absurdity but simultaneously respectability, embedded in Shakespeare’s Welshmen. 

Margaret of Anjou is one of England's most infamous medieval queens. Villified by Shakespeare, Margaret was coined a she-wolf of France like one of her predecessors, Isabella of France. Margaret had the unfortunate luck of being married to a king who was unable to rule. In addtion to lacking the militaristic qualities that made his father such a famed ruler, Henry VI also inherited a form of schizophrenia through his Valois ancestors, which incapacitated him as a ruler. he next in line to the throne was Margaret's infant son, Edward. Margaret's unusual upbringing allowed her to step up to head the Lancastrians without hesitation. Margaret led the Lancastrians on behalf of her son against the Yorks during the Wars of the Roses until the defeat of her son at the Battle of Tewkesbury. Margaret's power clearly evolved throughout the various stages of womanhood, and the extent of her power was directly linked to the degree to which she was able to lead the Lancastrians in England.

This paper explores the significance of war memorials and museums in constructing Soviet and Baltic memory under German and Soviet rule. From the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939 through World War II until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Baltic States were successively occupied by the Soviets and the Germans and then incorporated into the USSR in 1945. My research addresses the impact and controversy associated with Soviet memorials erected to the Red Army as the “liberators” of the Baltic region, along with the subsequent removal and destruction following the states becoming independent. Furthermore, my paper addresses the question of the ways in which the Baltic states’ narratives of their experiences under Soviet rule challenges Soviet and Russian memorializations of their role as liberators during World War II. In so doing, my paper attempts to unpack the multiple interpretations of the Baltic population’s experiences. 

Behind every great man is a woman - too often is this sentiment applied to Dorothy Wordsworth, sister, editor, and muse to the celebrated Romantic poet William Wordsworth. Relegation of Dorothy as merely a supporting figure in this way ignores her conscious struggle to engage with William’s poetry; her writing, in both prose and poetry forms, reveals a cognizant journey as tangible as movement through physical landscape. During my Ruhlman presentation, I will discuss the details of my thesis, which attempts to trace Dorothy’s migrations through her brother’s poetical conceptions of nature and explore how she tries to connect with a world that seems innately designed to reject her. 
 
This Ruhlman presentation will be a culmination of research made possible by the generous Schiff Fellowship award.
The Harvard Graduate Center dormitory complex is an emblem of the pedagogy and design ideology that Bauhaus-founder Walter Gropius brought to Harvard University. University President Conant appointed Gropius as the head of architecture at the Graduate School of Design, where the Bauhaus icon pioneered new pedagogical structures. The Graduate Center is a manifestation of the ideology Gropius injected into the conservative climate of Harvard University. Glass curtain-walls suffused interior spaces with sunlight, conducive for the healthy living that Bauhaus philosophy so cherished. Small private living quarters encouraged congregation in communal spaces, thus fostering intellectual exchange and collaborative learning, a shift away from traditional Beaux-Arts methods. Commissioning the Gropius-led firm The Architects Collaborative (TAC) to design the Graduate Center marked Harvard University’s pivotal departure from the solemn grandeur of Gothic cathedrals and the stateliness of Georgian courts. 

As an architecture student, with a focus on urban design, I am interested in understanding space through the visual mapping of human movement. For this project, I explored the movement of a dancer through space, focusing on pauses in her movement. I translated the movement into a series of two-dimensional line drawings, each of which provided me with a structural understanding of the movement of the body. I then explored these structural translations in alternate mediums, pulling them away from two-dimensional forms, into more three-dimensional representations. I created three-dimensional wire drawings, which provided a structural understanding of movement, as it exists in space. As I continue to work on this project, I hope to find ways of translating the relationship between body, movement, and space. 

“In Ukraine there are no Jews”, remarked Vassili Grossmann, the world famous author of “Life and Fate” as he was travelling through newly reconquered Crimea. He was sadly accurate. Of the 2,650,000 Jewish citizens estimated to have stayed in the occupied territories after the invasion, only around 110,000 survived. The other ones were killed by the German invaders. Yet, from 1945 on, the Holocaust was virtually non-existent in Soviet public memory and very dimly treated in Soviet historiography. Although suffering of Soviet Jews was acknowledged, it was portrayed as one detail in the larger picture of fascist attacks on the Soviet people.
Why was that so? This ist he question I investigated during the last semester under the auspices of Professor Tumarkin. During my research, I reached puzzling conclusions I would like to share.
 
My research examines Edward and Nancy Reddin Kienholz' Sawdy, a mixed media assemblage created by the couple in 1971, by analyzing it through the conceptual framework of installation art. The argument builds off of the idea that viewer inclusion is a strategy that is embedded in the visualization of racial violence. The approach is comparative as it studies the impact of viewer inclusion in both Sawdyand Five Car Stud, an installation realized between 1969 and 1972 by the same artists, on the viewer's engagement with the lynching imagery presented. The research also looks into Kienholz' documentation process which culminated in the Documentation Book for Five Car Stud Tableau and the Sawdy Edition(1972). In doing so, it interprets Sawdy as a serial artwork and “offspring” of Five Car Stud, highlighting how Sawdyfunctions as a vehicle for the simultaneous documentation and dissemination of controversial Five Car Stud.

Akazome Akiko won the 2010 Akutagawa Prize with her novella, The Maiden's Betrayal (Otome no mikkoku), a satirical take on girl culture in Japan. Her story follows a class of Japanese young women who are reading Anne Frank's diary in German and it draws parallels between their lives and that of Anne Frank's. Although I only translated a small portion of the entire work, I encountered the challenge of preserving her distinctive writing style and word choice. In particular, I will discuss her usage of the word otome (maiden) to describe these young women and her abnormally simple sentence structure that is reminiscent of a bad translation. 
Catalonia is the wealthiest of Spain’s 17 autonomous communities. It has its own language, a long history, and its own parliament and government. Does this mean it should become an independent nation? Within the past few years the Catalan independence movement has intrigued many, myself included, and has become the focus of my senior honors thesis. In my presentation I will discuss my research on the many political, historical, cultural, and social roots of Catalan nationalism. I will also outline how has this nationalist sentiment has changed over time in response to Spain’s complicated history of economic crises and political dictatorships. 
Painting, traditionally a two-dimensional median, is often built upon the effect of layering. Through layers of paint, the illusion of space can thus be achieved. In this series of fourteen painting canvases, instead of mounting additional matter to the surface of the canvas, pieces of canvas are carved out to create a hybrid representation of space, where minimal perspective drawings of fourteen rooms once lived by the artist blend with painting and crafting. Reflecting the artist’s architectural thinking, each canvas encapsulates memories of space and a life of traveling. Because of the subtracting process, canvas and the stretchers, often neglected as an invisible base covered behind artistic creations, are emphasized as art objects integral to the entire artwork.
 
The canvases, or objects, float in a “spatially layered” format, symbolizing stratified layers that all together comprise a large, conceptual painting. Meanwhile, due to the three-dimensional nature of the installation, each canvas could also be seen as a structural component that collectively builds an abstract architecture in the air.

John Keats prophesied that, “I think I shall be among the English poets after my death,” and strove throughout his short life to produce poetry that would elevate him to the same level as Shakespeare and Milton before him.  While he received mostly antagonistic literary reviews during his lifetime, Keats has since become one of the most beloved of the Romantic poets.  His poetry, strongly influenced by his youthful passion and the urgency of his quickly deteriorating health, blossomed between the years of 1818-1820, right before his death from tuberculosis at the age of 25.  By utilizing primary source documents, I am analyzing his poems within the context of letters he wrote to his close friends and family, which paint a near complete portrait of the inner workings of the poet’s mind.  My thesis focuses on how his physician’s training influenced his poetry, as well as how the circumstances surrounding his life shaped his writing, his views on life, and his own apparent mortality. 

The construction of sacred space and pilgrimage to sacred spaces is an essential part of religious traditions worldwide. How does the construction of sacred spaces and pilgrimage to these spaces aid religious practitioners in the transformation of their suffering? How do they allow us to move closer to God?
 
Focusing on sites devoted to the Virgin Mary, my research has lead me to explore how Lourdes, Guadalupe, and Nagasaki allow pilgrims to transform their suffering - not only at the personal level, but also the communal and institutional level. The construction and establishment of Marian pilgrimage sites offer religious practitioners control in their own lives, allow us to reconsider how the body and the earthly world play a role in the religious, and enable us to re-examine the draw of the Compassionate Mother. I argue that these sites and their construction are radical, subversive, and above all liberating.

In recent decades, technologies of incarceration have diversified, shifting towards subtler expressions of power and surveillance. My thesis analyzes this shift in women’s incarceration through the lens of neoliberal governmentality. I argue that incarceration serves not as a means of penance for a specific transgression, but as a vehicle for a gendered reeducation of desire designed to bring justice-involved women into line with normative roles. I draw from government documents addressing women’s incarceration in different states to demonstrate the extent to which neoliberal values and market principles have been incorporated into justice and punishment for women. Additionally, I critically examine the statistical tools used to classify justice-involved women and predict recidivism to highlight the disparities in the level of risk ascribed to different groups of justice-involved women, and how these disparities relate to women’s conformity to neoliberal norms.

Since its conception in 1916, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) has enacted multiple tariffs against unfair trade practices, including the “dumping” of foreign goods in US markets. The ITC claims to administer US trade laws in a fair and objective manner, provide independent analysis, and preserve American interests through remedial trade laws. In our three case studies - Chinese crawfish tail meat (1997), persulfates from China (!997), and certain South Korean large residential washers (2013) - we examine case background, methodology, and even politics to determine whether the tariffs have helped mitigate unfair trade. Economic analysis and research ranging from government documents to direct exchanges with people involved lead us to a unanimous determination. Come hear our verdict during the presentation. 

My thesis explores the mother-daughter relationship in three novels by French author Marguerite Duras. These works, the “Sea Wall Cycle,” are variations of a story about a young French girl in Indochina and her affair with an older, wealthy Chinese man. The girl’s mother, obsessed with becoming rich in the colonies, is financially ruined by the purchase of a farm that can’t be cultivated. Ironically, the mother becomes colonized herself, subject to the cruel waves of the ocean that drown her crops. She devolves into madness and violence, especially against her daughter, who is a representation of the author’s younger self. Before writing these novels, Duras­ –under her real name Donnadieu– co-authored L’Empire Français, propaganda commissioned by the French government to promote the exploitation of the French Colonies. Therefore, a post-colonial perspective enlightens a psychoanalytical analysis of the mother-daughter relationship and the blending of truth and literature into auto-fiction.

Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel (1805-46) was a gifted pianist and composer of songs known as Lieder, among other music. Though educated together with her brother Felix Mendelssohn and encouraged to excel, their careers diverged at a certain point such that Mendelssohn pursued a public career as a performer and composer, while Hensel’s career was restricted to the domestic sphere. Her deep longing for travel and the exotic was reflected in her music. The two journeys from Berlin during her lifetime – Switzerland and France during her adolescence (1822), then Italy later in life with her husband and child (1839) – produced several Lieder that reflected her fascination with places beyond Berlin. In this lecture performance, I will highlight examples in representative Lieder that contain Hensel’s sonic depictions of southern lands.

For her senior thesis, Lilly Starr Tyson '15 chose to create a short film inspired by the works of Alfred Hitchcock. In this film she explores themes of voyeurism, distrust of technology, psychopathy, and the all-seeing eye of the camera. 
The use of wearable technologies has taken off and one of the newest gadgets is the Fitbit. Fitbits are pedometers that either clip on your clothes or are worn around your wrist. They connect to your phone and computer where all of your steps get recorded and displayed as graphs on the app. My research studies the privacy preferences of Fitbit users as their fitness data is collected by a Fitbit and displayed on the Fitbit app, with the potential of sharing it with other Fitbit users. My study was conducted over the course of two months with twenty-one interviews of fitbit users. The interviews asked questions about a user’s satisfaction with their fitbit, frequency of use, and attention to privacy settings. The goal in this research is to look for a correlation between a user’s satisfaction with fitbit and their privacy concern.

As the transnational movement of people, goods, and services becomes more common, it is increasingly important to understand what kinds of social protections exist for migrants and their families, and specifically how people access and pay for health care. Our group explored the availability of healthcare resources for immigrants from two countries: Mexico and Peru. Amy Isabelle examined binational health insurance programs in the United States and Mexico and the ways in which such programs provide maternal and child health care. Leah Kaplan compared binational health insurance programs between California and Texas and Mexico and examined how these programs might affect binational health on a larger scale. Denesse Salto set out to investigate what, if any, healthcare resources and support networks do Peruvian expatriates have access to in the US, from government agencies in Peru, and from supranational organizations.

For an Astronomy 350 research project, I studied the asteroid (1742) Schaifers, a member of the Koronis family of asteroids, to determine its sidereal rotation period, spin vector orientation, and a model shape solution. Families of asteroids are of scientific interest due to their common origins from disruptions of parent bodies resulting from collisions. They are important, therefore, for understanding Solar System formation and evolution by taking advantage of family members’ common age and dynamical histories. It was previously discovered that the ten largest Koronis members have spin vectors that are clustered, rather than randomly distributed as would be expected from family formation. This result has been qualitatively attributed to YORP thermal torques. My work involved observing (1742) Schaifers and analyzing the data to increase the spin vector sample and aid future modeling of the YORP effect in the Solar System.

Prior research has shown that bilinguals outperform monolinguals in various non-linguistic tasks of executive functioning; however, at the same time, the majority of research examining a related and overlapping process, language production, has found relatively decreased production in bilinguals. Given inconsistencies in the literature regarding enhanced executive functioning performance and the associated language production in bilinguals, the specific nature of such an advantage remains unclear. We examined the nature of the bilingual advantage by investigating performance in three different components of executive functioning: inhibition, shifting, and updating. 71 monolingual and 72 bilingual participants recruited from the University of Washington’s psychology subject pool performed three executive functioning tasks and four manipulated speech tasks examining each of the three components. Come learn about the benefits and deficits that monolinguals and bilinguals face respectively on a daily basis. This summer research was funded by the Roberta Day Staley and Karl A. Staley Fund to conduct off-campus through the Wellesley College Science Center.

Our study examined people’s perceptions of women of two different sexual orientations (lesbian versus straight). We investigated differences in how agentic, communal, and dominant these groups are perceivedto be (i.e., descriptive stereotypes), as well as how agentic, communal, and dominant they are desired to be (i.e., prescriptive stereotypes). Our results demonstrate that people view lesbian women as possessing more traditionally masculine qualities compared to straight women, but people do not necessarily desire them to have such qualities. More specifically, people perceived lesbian women as being less communal and more agentic and dominant than straight women. Yet, lesbian women were desired to be more communal than they were perceived to be. Regardless of sexual orientation, all women were desired to be less dominant. The present study’s findings call for further investigation of ways in which stereotypes of women of different sexual orientations and races interact with one another, and affect gender discrimination and leadership.

Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in humans, and it recurs even after trimodal therapy with resection, chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy in almost every case. One school of thought proposes that weakening the blood vessels which supply nutrients to the growing tumor will prevent rogue tumor cells from migrating. In the Steele Lab, research has been conducted on special agents to target new vessel formation, or ‘angiogenesis.’ However, the anti-angiogenic agents had not been tested for interaction with radiochemotherapy in murine models, and thus their clinical relevance was minimal. Last semester, I set out with a team to design, implement and analyze an experiment to test the efficacy of adding chemotherapeutic agent lomustine (CCNU) to three anti-angiogenic treatment options under investigation. This presentation will chronicle the long, bumpy road from initial project conceptualization to final manuscript submission and all of the twists and turns in between.

After a semester working on a film set, we six students brought our expertise back to Wellesley and embarked on a collaborative film journey. With the help of the Pamela Daniels Fellowship, and the CAMS program, our cinematic dreams became a reality in the form of three short films. Exploring the genres of comedy and drama, we formed a production company, PE Req Films, and spent the semester further educating ourselves about the art of the short in a CAMS 350 independent study. In order to get the full experience of a film set, we each assumed different roles on each project – producer, director, writer, cinematographer, gaffer, and sound mixer. Experiential learning combined with student-led theoretical discussions allowed us to gain both practical and academic knowledge of short films as an art form. During this presentation, we will screen the three short films we made, last semester. 
Notch receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins of a signaling pathway that is crucial in regulation of cell differentiation and developmental processes in multicellular organisms. The Notch protein consists of an extracellular domain containing the ligand binding domain and the negative regulatory region (NRR), and an intracellular domain. Our research focuses on point mutations in the NRR’s Heterodimerization (HD) region that are associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias/lymphomas (T-ALL). Previous work showed that two T-ALL-associated Leu to Pro mutations in the HD region’s core had different effects on stability and secondary structure of the NRR. Our work examines two unique T-ALL-associated mutations, L1569H and L1663T. While L1569H and the previously studied mutations are in the hydrophobic core, L1663T is on the interface of the HD and the LIN-12 Repeats that comprise the NRR. This research contributes to an understanding of the relative importance of structural integrity versus stability in T-ALL cases.
For my thesis I have created paintings and other artworks that explore the nature and imagery of ruins, fragments, and cracks.  Using the leftover fragmented supports from 3D printing to make ruinous landscapes as models for paintings, I wanted to create a dialogue between new technology and older ways of producing art.  I have explored these themes and ideas through many media and materials, such as painting, plaster, photography, and video, which all contribute to my understanding and my studio practice.  I hope to prompt viewers to engage with my art and the concepts it presents, and to then take away a new perspective that they can apply to the world around them.

Honey bee (Apis mellifera) pollination generates billions of dollars for the global economy, but there are threats to their contribution to agricultural production. Habitat destruction and single-crop agriculture limit the richness of pollen, the primary source of protein, vitamins, and minerals for bees.  Adult bees consume pollen to produce food for their young, but larvae become undernourished during periods of pollen limitation. To determine the effects of larval undernourishment on adult behavior, we divided colonies so that they produced either pollen-limited or abundantly supplied young. When focal larvae became adults, they were weighed, individually tagged, and introduced into a single colony, where we monitored their foraging behavior.  Compared to control bees, we expect adults from pollen-stressed colonies to perform poorly during foraging, recruitment, and as they orient to their homes. Such underperforming bees would likely exacerbate the cycle of nutritional stress experienced by colonies as they forage in their habitat. 

The interactions of proteins with other proteins drive biological function. Understanding the physical and chemical principles governing specificity and promiscuity in protein—protein binding is important both for understanding mechanisms of molecular recognition and for designing novel biomolecular systems. We use computational techniques to identify the frequencies of occurrence of structural moieties (e.g., side chains and backbones of individual residues) and differences in their energetic contributions within promiscuous and specific protein—protein interactions. To achieve this goal, we are testing multiple hypotheses; for example, we hypothesize that specific proteins, which selectively bind to only one partner, preferentially utilize side chains to mediate binding when compared to promiscuous proteins, which may utilize the structurally consistent backbone moieties more preferentially. Two sets of protein complexes, identified by the literature to be either promiscuous or specific, are being analyzed to test our hypotheses. Preliminary results suggest statistically significant differences between the contributions of certain structural moieties between the two sets. 

Despite the advances in prosthetic and robotic alternatives to limb loss, little progress has made in human limb regenerative therapy. While mammals have the ability to heal after an amputation, most are unable to form a blastema. Currently, the genes needed for blastema formation are not known, but by examining the genes used during Tribolium castaneum beetle regeneration, these potential factors can begin to be identified. Knocking down the expression of enhancer of zeste and polycomb led to prolonged maintenance of blastema after Tribolium larval legs were ablated. Studies are currently underway to determine which blastema-specific genes are turned on or off in these structures. Once the genes necessary for forming a blastema are identified, it may one day be possible to turn on these blastema-inducer genes in humans and promote human limb regeneration.

Remember that house you built with LEGOs? What if you could add a working doorbell, light, and chimney with just a few more pieces? The latest technology toys can do just that, making any creation come alive. Toys such as littleBits, magnetic modules that snap together to make sophisticated circuits, and KIBO, interactive robots that can be programmed using wooden blocks, are two tangible technologies that offer increased opportunities for young children to engage in playful, exploratory learning while developing computational thinking skills. I’ve collected data from over 20 hours of user study sessions, robotics workshops, and in-classroom robotics activities to investigate what design factors affect engagement, creativity, and collaboration in computational thinking toys like littleBits and KIBO. In addition, my research offers suggestions for how to best support the use of these toys in various contexts and discusses opportunities for new toys.

Songwriting is my preferred medium of self-expression. In these formative college years, I have written a motley collection of songs, in which I’ve attempted to capture some of the feelings, worries, and ideals of a modern twenty-something who has every resource at her disposal, but nothing yet to call her own. Previously, these songs existed – were trapped, rather – exclusively in my mind or within the intimate spaces of Cambridge coffee shops.  Now, with the generous funding of the Pamela Daniels Fellowship, I seek to learn what it takes to record and produce a full-length album. In this masterclass-inspired presentation, I will perform selected original works from my upcoming album, Unintended Soliloquies, and will demonstrate how I have chosen to arrange, record, structure, and master these songs. My goal is to produce a physical recording that matches how I’ve imagined these songs in countless real and imagined performances.

Throughout the Fall 2014 semester, and in coordination with researchers at The Fenway Institute of Fenway Health, I completed an independent study, which examined the relationship between the age at which transgender individuals become aware of their gender identities and their later mental health outcomes. We hypothesized that younger ages of awareness would lead to worse mental health later in life, including increased depression and negative body image. Furthermore, we expected that worse body image would predict increased depression and that this relationship would exaggerate that between age of awareness and depression. Using bivariate and multiple regressions, we investigated the predictive nature of age of awareness, as well as current age, gender identity, race, education, survey modality, and employment, on transgender individuals’ depression and body image. While some of our hypotheses were unconfirmed, we found other predictors of mental health outcomes in transgender people.

Revamping the housing lottery seemed a perfect fit with our newly acquired programming and data manipulation skills. Previously, Wellesley has used minimal technology in the process of sorting students into their residence halls for the following year. We found that many elements could be automated. This inspired us write a computer program to maximize the efficiency of all parties involved. Our program provides one solution to the existing system. Our proposed solution mostly impacts the administrative side by removing the need to manually sort roughly 2,300 pieces of paper, one for each student on campus. We also hope to make it more convenient for students to complete and submit their housing preferences online, instead of printing and delivering forms. This project has enabled us to experience working on a large scale project, communicating with a “client,” and applying the tools we have learned in the classroom thus far.

The prevailing attitudes about teaching religion in public schools stem from a multiplicity of cultural associations and understandings. Many scholars argue that increasing religious literacy helps decrease conflict between various religious groups that arise from ignorance, prejudice, stereotyping and mutual suspicion. Instead of imposing religious values onto impressionable minds, these scholars contend that allowing students the opportunity to learn about world religions will make them more socially aware and responsible members of their communities. But clearly not all Americans agree. My research explores the implications of incorporating teaching about religions in public schools and considers how decisions are made about permitting religious observances and practices in public schools. 

Memory is often better for events or items that are remembered in a context similar to the context in which they were first experienced. This phenomenon is known as the context effect. We examined the effect of two different kinds of context on memory: video and background color. Participants studied concrete words (e.g. flower, yacht, bucket) and abstract words (e.g. kindness, memory, fate) embedded on a video or a colored background context. A few minutes later they were asked to recall words in a video/background color context that was either similar to or different from the study context. We predicted that memory for words would be better when the context at recall matched the context at study. Our findings may have implications for studying and taking exams: Because we cannot watch Netflix while taking exams, it is probably best not to watch it while studying either! 
Color vision depends upon three classes of retinal photoreceptors, whose activities are compared at multiple neural stages to compute the brain’s representation of color. We recorded from V4/Posterior Inferior Temporal Cortex in fixating monkeys, a mid-tier stage containing color-selective cells. Cell responses to 45 hues at three luminance levels (low, equiluminant, and high, relative to the adapting background) were analyzed. We test the hypothesis that these neurons are correlated with color perception by measuring color tuning as a function of luminance changes. One subtle color change introduced by modulating luminance is the Bezold-Brücke hue shift (a light appearing green at high luminance requires more long-wavelength power to appear the same green at low luminance). We find that tuning shifts consistent with the Bezold-Brücke hue shift are found in many glob cells. We replicate this experiment psychophysically in humans to show the extent to which glob cells are correlated with perception.  
Primary productivity, the rate at which energy is converted by phytoplankton, relies on nutrient availability and sunlight. Cholorphyll-a, used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, was studied in parallel with nitrate and phosphate concentrations to determine if there was a correlation between nutrient concentrations and primary productivity. We also investigated the limiting factors of phytoplankton growth in the surface of the temperate North Atlantic Ocean. We hypothesized that as we became distant from shore, chl-a would decrease as nutrients would increase and that our findings would follow Redfield's 16:1 ratio. However, our data showed that chl-a and nutrient concentrations were not only influenced by how close we were to land, but also by depth and warm core rings. Nitrogen was the limiting factor to primary production, but our findings did not follow Redfield’s ratio. 
Identifying gene pathways in in vivo systems is an arduous process, which can be expedited by using computational techniques to predict potential pathways. The purpose of this project was to predict novel mitochondrial gene pathways using sequence comparison and microarray data. After compiling a comprehensive list of mitochondria related proteins in S. cervisiae, the DNA sequences for these genes were compared across a variety of fungal species and model organisms. Hierarchical clustering separated the genes into seven subgroups with varying degrees of sequence conservation. For the least conserved genes, microarray data was taken from various conditions that impact metabolic function, and genes that were coexpressed in many conditions were predicted to be in the same genetic pathway. One of the largest predicted pathways consists of fourteen genes which involved in mitophagy signaling and was selected for further in vivo analysis.
During cellular respiration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) escape from mitochondria to oxidize cellular components including DNA. Of all four DNA bases, guanine has the lowest redox potential, resulting in the oxidation of DNA to form 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG).  Because it has an even lower redox potential than guanine itself, 8-oxoG is likely to be even further oxidized.  Of the potential products that can result from the oxidation of 8-oxoG, the formation of spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp) is of particular interest, as it appears to be even more mutagenic than 8-oxoG. Previous investigators demonstrated that the Sp lesion significantly destabilizes duplex DNA when compared to both its parent lesion 8-oxoG and guanine. As the structure of genomic DNA in chromatin is more complex, our goal is to examine the effect of the Sp lesion on nucleosome formation.
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and it is known for early metastasis and invasive tumor progression. Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of pancreatic cancer cells to survive nutrient starvation, a unique characteristic that normal human fibroblasts do not possess. Isolated from a marine fungus, spiroxin A has been shown to exhibit antitumor and antibacterial activities. Inspired by the potential therapeutic effect of spiroxin A, our group has initiated a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study to investigate the relationship between the structural components of spiroxin A and its biological activities. Various synthetic intermediates en route to spiroxin A were tested against human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line PANC-1 under nutrient-deprived and nutrient-rich conditions. Herein, we report the identification of a lead compound possessing cytotoxicity against PANC-1 cells selectively under nutrient-deprived conditions, as well as the ongoing SAR study. This project is in collaboration with Professor Andrew Webb in the Department of Biological Sciences.
In every pump of the heart, a wave of ions floods into each cardiomyocyte, propagating an electrical impulse that allows millions of cells to contract and relax the muscle in unison. HERG and KvLQT1 are two ion channels integral to repolarization, serving to “reset” the heartbeat. The Darling lab at Wellesley investigates the interaction of these two proteins by expressing KvLQT1 and HERG as fusions to fluorescent markers in cellular systems. We use biochemical assays such as Western blotting and imaging techniques like Forster Resonance Energy Transfer to understand the mechanism of HERG-KvLQT1 interactions. Our data suggest that the physiologically important molecule cAMP is directly involved in modulating interaction, and we continue to test this hypothesis. Future studies will focus on the implications of these interactions for cardiac physiology: studying the molecular basis of current regulation is a step towards understanding cardiac arrhythmia and the heartbeat’s response to environmental factors.
A Wellesley student once said, “I had been masturbating for about a year [...] but man, did that vibrator change my world”. Have you ever asserted your sexual desire? Are we conditioned to limit expressing our sexual desires and pleasures? Do we value non-heteronormative sexual pleasure? Taking inspiration from an assignment in Introduction to Reproductive Issues, we invited students and faculty to submit anonymously stories about their experiences of sexual pleasure or desire. These stories will put voices to our diverse sexual experiences, normalize conversations about this topic, and encourage us to explore our sexuality. At this speak-out, we will read these stories out loud, thereby transforming these sexual experiences that many of us feel ashamed of into sources of empowerment. Bringing these private experiences safely into public space, we hope everyone in the Wellesley community realizes that they are not alone in their struggles with sexual desire, pleasure, and agency.
All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. (Leo Tolstoy)  If all “happy families” look the same, is it an illusion? This group of paintings examines a single American middle-class family and those events that all appear ubiquitous: washing dishes, doing laundry, Christmases and Birthdays. In painting the artist attempts to pull apart brutal and eerie moments that pass beneath the calm veneer of everyday.
Nanoscience is an expanding field of scientific research. Within the field, gold nanoparticles are particularly interesting because of their unique physicochemical properties. This panel discusses gold nanoparticles for biomedical and bio-/chemical sensing applications. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be tailored to create a multi-functional nano-vehicle for ‘smart’ cancer treatment. Our proposed nano-vehicle consists of an iron core for tracking and a gold shell to which we can attach molecules for targeting cancer cells and treating the cancer. We will examine both the construction of these particles and their interactions in physiological systems. In addition, AuNPs can be used for sensing applications, often as thin films on substrates such as glass. For these applications, it is important that thin film integrity is retained over a long period of time. Therefore, we seek to assess the temporal stability and determine the mechanisms of degradation of thin films of AuNPs on glass substrates.
With the innovation in technology, wearable devices start to become part of our daily life. Combining our interest in technology and in art, we studied the impact of wearable devices, such as Google Glass, and of augmented reality technology in museums. Furthermore, we investigated how Google Glass can present the invisible information behind the scene to the visitors interactively. In collaboration with the Davis Museum, we worked on a prototype for a Google Glass application in the past year. Using Augmented Reality technology, our application can recognize the artwork that the user is looking at, and invite the user to interact with the artwork through prompts and questions.



This study sought to understand the present status of healthcare among Afghan refugees in New Delhi, India. The research questions were: What is the current status of healthcare for Afghan refugees in New Delhi, India and why are there limited healthcare resources for them? A comprehensive review of the services provided by current and former UNHCR partnerships was done in order to evaluate Afghan refugee’s healthcare status. The study looked into the healthcare facilities accessibility and financial burden posed by medical expenses to Afghan refugees. The Voluntary Health Association of Delhi (VHAD) supported the study’s fieldwork. Primary methods of data collection included interviews with Afghan refugees from various socio-economic classes, former and current UNHCR partners, a critic of the UNHCR, and international marketing directors of private hospitals. This investigation sought to understand how the precarious status of Afghan refugees in India affects their ability to fulfill their healthcare needs. 



The prevalence of severe childhood obesity continues to increase at a time when obesity is an epidemic amongst the general population. In this study we will use empirical data to analyze the correlation of the mathematical model of the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) Body Mass Index (BMI) charts with the trend of children with severe early onset obesity. We found that the longitudinal trends in BMI show a faster velocity than the trends predicted by the CDC growth curves. It is possible that these differences of velocities for BMI trends indicate a possible genetic predisposition for obesity. These findings suggest a strong genetic component to severe early onset obesity. Therefore, we propose the development of a new application utilizing a multi-point scoring system that would allow physicians to determine a patient’s qualification for genetic testing to determine the genetic basis of severe early onset obesity.

Using anonymized data from a large MOOC online forum, we analyzed the behavior of its users. Active students , those who contribute to what is visible in a forum by posting and voting, represent only a third of the total number of users, with the remaining users participating passively. These latter students use the forum to supplement their learning by reading, but remain invisible. This invisible activity is something that active users as well as passive users practice, making up over 97% of total forum activity. However, our analysis shows that students who complete the course are more active in the forum, and that a larger percentage of active participants complete the course compared to passive participants. The story is more complicated though: many students who had high-activity levels in the forums did not complete the course, while many students who completed the course had low engagement in the forum.

One of the great plagues of antiquity, tuberculosis (TB) today continues as one of the most devastating global diseases. The rise of multiply drug-resistant TB has led to a pressing need for new treatments to help contain the infection. Recently, a significant
amount of research in drug design and discovery has focused on the chalcone and pyrazoline families of compounds, both of which have demonstrated strong potential as antitubercular agents. A classical synthesis of a pyrazoline occurs in two steps: 1) a base-catalyzed aldol condensation between an aromatic ketone and an aldehyde to form a chalcone; 2) cyclization of the chalcone with a hydrazine to prepare the pyrazoline. Here, the laboratory preparation and biological testing of several novel chalcone and pyrazoline derivatives is described. The synthesis of these compounds was guided by a pharmacophoric model of antitubercular five-membered ring heterocycles with strong activity.

In response to stress, cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause molecular damage in the form of DNA breaks and modification of lipids and proteins. ROS are also important in cell signaling to induce differential gene expression, metabolic changes and, thus, adaptation to environmental conditions. I hypothesize that ROS response is a common denominator of different environmental challenges, including radiation and microgravity, during spaceflight. Algae, such as the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, grown in spaceflight are exposed to stress. The goal is to characterize the response of C. reinhardtii to stress by examining biochemical and gene expression changes using heat shock. The heat shocked (42°C) C. reinhardtii exhibited a selective regulation of ion transporters and an increase in ROS. Such results provide new insights about the cellular response to stress and its possible mediation during long-term environmental pressure (including spaceflight), and provide a basis for understanding multicellularity evolution.  

Songbirds, like zebra finches (Taeniopgia guttata), are an excellent model for human language acquisition, and for studying mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Songbirds share many developmental and anatomical traits with humans, such as similar process of vocal acquisition and analogous auditory processing regions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used a noninvasive technique to collect real-time, whole-brain data. In this project, fMRI is used to investigate brain activation due to an auditory stimulus such as familiar or unfamiliar song. This data shows relatively high regional specificity and high temporal specificity. Because fMRI is noninvasive, we are able to introduce multiple stimuli and observe brain activation at various time points in one bird’s life. Our current work is centered on validating the auditory delivery of natural sounding stimuli and statistical analytical methods. We aim to develop these methods in order to acquire high-quality neuronal data.
 
Exploring Silica-coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles as A Drug Delivery System for Pancreatic Cancer (Alice Liao and Susan Haney)
Due to their small size, nanoparticles (NPs) are a suitable platform for building the next-generation targeted therapy for cancer. The high surface-to-volume ratio and well-studied surface chemistry of NPs allow for efficient loading of treatment and targeting moieties. This maximizes drug delivery and ensures high tumor specificity, while sparing healthy tissue. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) NPs, a type of magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent, combine the small size of nanomaterials with the benefits of MR imaging to provide a non-invasive method for tracking NPs inside the human body. Coating the nanoparticles with silica and polyethylene glycol (PEG) improves their biocompatibility and stability. Previous efforts successfully synthesized silica-coated SPIO NPs with a diameter of approximately 50 nm and a shell thickness of 10-20 nm. Current studies focus on exploring how coatings affect the magnetic properties of the NPs, with the goal of optimizing their performance as MRI contrast agents. Bioimaging methods are being optimized to quantify cellular particle uptake after the addition of a cancer-targeting moiety, a monoclonal antibody, to the particle surface.
 
The World Health Organization (2013) describes schizophrenia (SZ) as a chronic brain disorder that affects 24 million people worldwide, only about half of whom receive treatment. SZ is characterized by positive symptoms such as hallucinations, and negative symptoms such as memory, cognitive, and social deficits. Existing SZ medications only adequately address positive symptoms. Consequently, the development of new mouse models from which novel medication can be created is an important research field. Schizophrenia’s specific cause remains unknown, but it is widely accepted that genetic and epigenetic causes are at play. To address these causes we use mice bred with a mutation that knocks out a gene (GCPII) responsible for producing the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is found in altered levels in humans with SZ. We aggravate the model further by introducing a virus to neonatal mice that affects gene expression, simulating epigenetic dysregulation. We analyze the effects of the model on mouse brain anatomy and function using three magnetic resonance (MR) techniques: MR imaging, looking at brain anatomy, MR spectroscopy, assessing levels of brain chemicals, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), analyzing brain region connectivity and white matter structure; these data are collected once a week between postnatal days (PND) 28 and 64. Social withdrawal is investigated using a behavior paradigm between PND 114 and 117. Future work involves more data collection and developing a new behavioral test to analyze memory.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most devastating forms of human cancer. The lack of effective clinical treatments for pancreatic cancer has led to one of the lowest five-year survival rates (6.7%) among all cancers. Recently, our laboratory has reported a novel series of isoprenylated coumarin derivatives that have exhibited selective cytotoxicity against human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line PANC-1 under nutrient-deprived conditions. In this study, we report the effect of the various cell culture components on the preferential cytotoxicity of the coumarin derivatives against pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line PANC-1. In addition, two other pancreatic cancer cell lines were examined under both nutrient-rich and nutrient-deprived conditions.

Energy, defined as “activity in work”, exists in various forms, whether in the context of thermal, chemical, mechanical, or biological processes. At Wellesley College, the cogeneration (Cogen) power plant produces energy such as electricity, hot water, and air conditioning for the campus. Built in 1994, the Wellesley power plant was considered a technological marvel, primarily using natural gas which is cleaner and releases fewer greenhouse gas emissions than other fossil fuels. Now, over two decades later, the power plant has become obsolete and replacements are no longer being manufactured. Not only does this pose major uncertainties about the reliability of the plant in the future but there are also environmental, social, and economic factors to consider. With this in mind, the ES300 team will present their findings on Wellesley’s current power plant situation, and propose recommendations and goals for practical practices and technologies to improve efficiency.

Current literature on autism spectrum disorders points increasingly towards genetic causes on a molecular level.  This summer, I had the opportunity to work with associates of the Anderson Laboratory at Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center and investigate a gene of interest, UBE3A.  A maternal deletion in a particular region of chromosome 15 results in loss of neuronal UBE3A, which results in Angelman Syndrome. However, a duplication and triplication in the same chromosomal region result in two different forms of autism.  We studied the role of UBE3A in both its regulation and effects on the brain, as well as functionality in response to signaling pathways. Outcomes of these studies might lend support to a better understanding of pathology and potential treatments for autism spectrum disorders.

The Cape Ann pluton is a Paleozoic alkalic intrusion post-dating 630-580 Ma Avalonian magmatism in SE New England. Such alkalic compositions are associated with intra-plate magmatic systems produced when hot, mantle-derived magmas invade and melt continental crust. This study investigates whether apparently co-genetic mafic and felsic rocks on Salem Neck, MA in the contact zone of the Cape Ann pluton could represent this type of situation. Detailed mapping indicates more complex field relationships than previously published, revealing a NE-SW trending contact between gabbro-diorite and pillowed complex units. CA-TIMS analyses from zircons separated from syenite in the pillowed complex give weighted mean 206Pb/238U dates that can be compared with precisely dated granites farther north in the pluton. Uncertainties of ±100 Ka on all of these dates are orders of magnitude more precise than the available upper concordia intercept date obtained more than 40 years ago of 450 ±25 Ma.

My independent study research this semester focuses on nineteenth-century sculptor Anne Whitney. Wellesley College has a close connection with Whitney, as it is home to eight of Whitney’s sculptures, and to four thousand of her letters, which encapsulate her life and career at home and abroad in Europe. This semester, I am utilizing Whitney’s letters and other thematic sources to produce catalog entries for these eight sculptures. My research will culminate in a virtual exhibition on “Dear Home,” Wellesley’s online database dedicated to Whitney. Additionally, in order to understand nineteenth-century sculpture methods on a deeper level, I am undertaking studio work of my own, guided by Professor Carlos Dorrien, in the mediums of clay, plaster, marble, and bronze. I invite you to join me in the Davis Museum to examine some of Whitney’s works first-hand and to explore the nexus between the art studio and art-historical scholarship.

Light is an important ingredient in many chemical reactions, so understanding the chemical behavior of atmospheres and other astronomical collections of gases relies on knowledge of the photochemistry of each molecule present. Because some conditions can be difficult to reproduce experimentally, models which explain light-matter interactions are necessary. We use the Coupled Schrodinger Equation technique to produce models of the interaction of sulfur monoxide and carbon monoxide with ultraviolet light, including predissociation. Predissociation is a specific type of dissociation caused by discrete, instead of continuous, bands of wavelengths. Because different isotopes will interact with bands of slightly different wavelengths, predissociation can lead to mass-independent isotope fractionation effects, which are an important marker of the history of both extraterrestrial objects and our own planet.

Interactive stereoscopic 3D displays offer the promise to enhance 3D spatial problems solving by leveraging three different immersion cues: binocular parallax, motion parallax, and haptic feedback. However, this potential has not yet been proven empirically. Our goal is to understand which immersion cues contribute to improve 3D spatial problem solving. We present a user study that takes an in-depth look at the effect of immersion cues on 3D spatial problem solving by combining traditional performance and experience measures with brain data. 

Since their discovery massive quiescent galaxies continue to challenge the prevailing scenarios of galaxy evolution. These luminous galaxies, colloquially referred to as “red nuggets, are characterized by high velocity dispersions, small effective radii, and little to no evidence of active star formation. The mechanism driving the observed size evolution of massive quiescent galaxies, with the distant objects being 2 - 5 times smaller than their counterparts in the local Universe, remains an open question whose answer will provide insight into the field of galaxy evolution as a whole. Compact quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.6 < z < 1.1) are the missing link needed to complete the evolutionary histories of these objects from the early to the local Universe. We identify and characterize a sample of intermediate redshift compact quiescent galaxies by mining the DEEP2 Redshift Survey in conjunction with archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging. 

The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a defect in the structure of
diamond, roughly the size of a single atom, that possesses
properties that make it applicable to quantum computing, high-
resolution magnetic resonance imaging, and probing biological
systems. When an NV center is excited by a green photon, a short
time later it emits a red photon. By detecting the intensity of the
emitted red light using a confocal microscope, we can determine the
quantum state of a single NV center, which is crucial for various
applications. We have built an autocorrelation device that
measures, with sub-nanosecond accuracy, the statistical distribution
of the arrival times of the emitted red photons at a detector. When
the collected light is due to a single NV center there is a vanishing
probability that two photons arrive at the same time.

Out with the old, in with the new. South Korea today is scarcely recognizable from the nation it was 20 years ago. In the blink of an eye Korea has transformed from third-world country to global leader in information technology and pop culture. Korea’s emergence onto the world stage is well represented by a shift in language use in Korean society. During fall 2014, members of Korean 206, Introduction to Korean Language and Culture, conducted research exploring how the socio-cultural factors of globalization, nationalism, and diversity manifest in language usage. Our projects include examining language nationalism and the contradictory obsession with English, body gestures of idols, language hybridization in the composition of hip-hop music, and mania for English education. While also making cross-cultural comparisons with other Asian nations, we will discuss how Korean media and pop culture exemplify the transformation of South Korean society and cultural norms.

Drinking water is one of the most efficient ways to transport a diverse set of pathogens to a vast number of people, resulting in widespread illness, and in some cases death. As such, water quality is a serious public health concern worldwide. Due to their low cost and easy accessibility, common household materials such asbleach and vinegar, have been used for water decontamination for decades.  However, there are only a very small number of systematic and quantitative studies on the efficacy of these methods as well as their impact on the biochemical profile of the pathogens.  Escherichia coli (E.coli) is commonly used as an indicator of bacterial contamination due to its prevalence and high mortality rate. In this study, we examined the effects of low pH established by varying concentrations of different acid treatments on E.coli viability and protein expression profiles. A combination of standard culture plating assays and spectroscopic measurements were used to assess viability and determine the minimal acid concentration needed to keep bacterial levels below the EPA’s safe drinking water limits. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) Biotyper was used to analyze changes in the unique protein fingerprint of E.coli harvested at different time points after being subjected to multiple rounds of acid treatment. This work represents the initial step in identifying the E.coli proteins whose expression is altered in response to acid stress.  This information would be important in determining if acid stress results in bacterial resistance and if so, help to developing strategies to overcome it.
 
Many studies seek to understand the basic mechanisms that
drive the synthesis of “complex” interstellar molecules
detected via spectroscopy. While UV photolysis has been one
proposed mechanism, we seek to understand the role of
secondary low-energy electron-induced reactions in these
radiolytic processes. Using post-irradiation temperature-
programmed desorption (TPD), we have investigated the
radiolysis initiated by high-energy (1000 eV) electrons in
condensed ammonia at ~ 90 K under ultrahigh vacuum
(1×10−9 Torr) conditions. We have found evidence for the
formation of two condensed-phase ammonia radiolysis
products: hydrazine (N2H4) and diazene (N2H2). Quantifying the
amount of product formed as function of various irradiation
parameters (e.g., electron dose) provides useful kinetic
parameters, such as cross sections for the electron-induced
destruction and desorption of condensed ammonia.

Atom-sized defects in diamond known as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers have recently attracted much interest for their potential use as qubits in quantum computers. Whereas classical bits have a value of either 0 or 1, qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or a superposition of these two states. As a result, quantum computers can perform computations much more quickly and solve more complex problems than classical computers. An NV center can function as a qubit, where the two states of the qubit are the two spin states of the NV center. The spin state can be manipulated using microwave radiation and then read out optically. This year, I have been working towards performing optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) experiments of NV centers. Our ultimate goal is to isolate and manipulate a single NV center as a qubit. (This work was supported by the STC Center for Integrated Quantum Materials, NSF Grant No. DMR-1231319.)

Asteroids represent some of the oldest clues to to solar system formation. Studying the properties of these objects sheds light on the evolution and formation of small rocky bodies. Members of asteroid families are formed together and have similar orbit properties, thus they are of the same age and are subject to similar evolutionary processes. 30 years of study of the spins in the Koronis family gives us approximately 15 spin vectors. I analyzed new data for 4 more Koronis family members: (811) Nauhemia, (1245) Calvinia, (1848) Delvaux, and (2144) Marietta. These data, collected since 2002 using Wellesley's own 24-inch telescope, allow us to use Sidereal Photometric Astrometry analysis to produce possible spin directions and pole solutions. Discover how epoch information from multiple years allows us to visualize and analyze objects too small and too far away to directly resolve from Earth.   

In Shanghai, public knowledge about detrimental health effects of air pollution led to a rise in a range of commercial air filter models on the consumer market. There have not been previous studies that evaluate the range of particulate matter that these air-filtering devises trap. This study looks into the composition of PM trapped by commercial air filters. After gathering PM trapped by air filters, X-ray fluoresce was used to determine the bulk metals. Dust wipe samples were collected from the household to determine types of particulates that personal air filtering devices did not trap. Determining the composition of PM on air filters compared with PM in dust within the household provides insight into the effectiveness of commercial air filters and sources of PM. Although various air filtration systems are available, the urban poor cannot afford these systems and are subject to the full effects of PM. 
Computer Security is an increasingly relevant topic, with attacks on large companies like Sony, Target and Apple frequently making headline news. The task of protecting computer systems falls within the realm of Computer Science; but the effects of an attack reach countless other disciplines and impact millions of people. With the frequency of such attacks increasing, it is important to consider what effects such attacks have on society and what people can do to prevent their personal data from being compromised. Through data visualization, previous attacks can help reveal certain trends in cyber security and raise awareness to the importance of preventing more large-scale attacks.

Play is an important aspect of a child’s life. Through play a child is able to reconstruct reality, work through social-emotional challenges, and express many forms of creativity. Targeting the age of 4-5 year olds, I have explored the history of play environments and playthings and observed extensively at the Child Study Center, to enable me to design and pilot a toy. This session will introduce the audience to play as if they were instructors in a professional development workshop. As a part of a toy pilot, audience members will investigate play through playing with prototypes of the toy I have designed and piloted with children, as well as learn about how this toy and concept could be integrated into a learning environment. Audience participation will be encouraged and expected, including filling out a survey after the session using a link I will provide.

We present our political science thesis research topics, including private military contracting, Sino-US relations, American drone warfare, and spoiler violence. Kendall discusses the implications of private contracting in small-scale American interventions by exploring U.S. involvement in Colombia in the early 2000s. What lessons does Colombia offer for future U.S. contracting efforts? Wenyan analyzes Sino-U.S. relations during the Cold War. Why did Sino-U.S. confrontation persist, despite the fact that the USSR seemed to present a greater danger to both? Lavanya examines whether air and drone strikes have been effective in diminishing the al Qaeda insurgency and militancy in Yemen. Are drones counterproductive to U.S. security goals? Do they inspire more violence? Finally, Claire evaluates the 1997 split within the Irish Republican Army. Did dissidents seek to undermine the peace process or did negotiations present opportunities for local leaders to exploit existing divisions and consolidate power?

The Milky Way is filled with an unknown number of planets orbiting stars of all different kinds.  Exoplanets range from Earth sized to many times larger than Jupiter, and we have set out to try and find new exoplanets as a part of the KELT (Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope) project.  KELT has been active since 2005, seeking out hot Jupiter exoplanets that are eclipsing their host stars.  As members of the KELT follow-up team, we use our 24 telescope to collect data on top-secret potential exoplanets.  We will present our data and analysis of observed KELT targets, as well as presenting the intricacies of exoplanet systems, some of which may resemble systems much like our own solar system.  We will demonstrate the complexity and science behind being a true planet hunter.

Adult neurogenesis, or the birth of new neurons in the adult brain, is common in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Current investigations in mammalian models suggest that stem cells involved in adult neurogenesis are self-renewing and produce lineages of neuronal precursor cells. Based on our studies of the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, we have found that although the pool of first-generation neuronal precursors in the neurogenic niche are never depleted, these cells are NOT self-renewing. Recent work has demonstrated that the immune system is one source of these neuronal precursors in the crayfish. The goals of our ongoing work are to further elucidate this relationship. One aim is to identify which tissues within the immune system generate these neuronal precursor cells. A second aim is to confirm the morphological properties and targets of the newborn cells.

The campus of Wellesley College is imbued with nature and art, but many fine features go unnoticed as we hustle past them every day. Join the Davis Museum and the Botanistas in learning about Mozart III, the sculpture composite of metal tubes outside the Science Center, and its neighbors, the fan-leafed gingko trees, and dive into the rich meaning and beauty of our surroundings.
(This presentation is part of the Bark and Metal talk series on campus sculptures and trees, a Friends of Art Student Initiative Program of the Davis Museum in collaboration with Botanistas Tree Mob Series).

This presentation explores the privacy implications and risks associated with New York City’s stop-and-frisk data release. It examines the potential for reidentification of this dataset and proposes a way to privately model the data using differential privacy techniques.

Students explore the human skeleton for six weeks, developing drawings in a variety of media. These homework assignments support the major ongoing work of the class: drawing the  live model.

My thesis focuses on how the narrative structure and interfaces of comics and other graphic stories can be adapted to take the advantage of the web platform.  My focus has mostly been directed towards experimenting with the narrative structure of the story, from applying a non-sequential and fragmented structure to a print comic strip to creating a graphic narrative with hypertext. My focus for this semester will be on developing the interface and how the visual presentation of a graphic narrative can be changed to better fit the web platform. Currently, I have been experimenting with the narrative structure and visual presentation of “The Bicyclist”, a graphic story about a student who accidentally commits a hit and run.  This story has already gone through several iterations.  I have also created “26” an interactive graphic narrative about the passengers on a bus and I hope to create more stories throughout the semester. 

App Inventor is a blocks-based programming environment in which users connect puzzle-shaped blocks to build apps for Android devices. It supports a Python-like list data structure typically manipulated with loops, but it lacks important list operations like sorting and reversal that can greatly simplify list manipulation. It also lacks standard higher-order list operators such as map, filter, and reduce found in Python as well as many functional languages. My project centers around two main parts: (1) extending the implementation of App Inventor to include new blocks that map, filter, reduce, sort, and reverse lists, and assessing the usability of these new higher-order operators compared to loops and (2) modifying many list operator blocks to include a mechanism that allows users to choose between making the operator nondestructive (returns a new list) or destructive (changes the input list), and assessing the usability of this mechanism.

Visual Programming Languages (VPLs) allow users to manipulate code fragments graphically rather than textually. The spatial arrangement and connection of these code fragments, often represented as blocks, result in computer programs. The visual nature of VPLs makes programming more accessible for novice programmers. MIT App Inventor, a popular online tool for creating Android applications, is one such VPL. Users can begin creating Android applications very easily; however, the more complex the program, the more difficult it becomes to read and organize. Although, App Inventor provides some organization methods, users have little input on how the blocks will be rearranged. I worked on creating Folders, a visual organizational tool for App Inventor, as my senior thesis to address the deficiency in user-preference driven block organization. My project allows users to put their blocks into Folders and, thus, organize the blocks workspace, similar to the function of folders in the Desktop metaphor.
Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are found in US streams and rivers in low concentrations, and are thus present in the water humans divert and treat before use as drinking water. Caffeine is one organic compound that enters drinking water treatment plants in relatively high concentrations. We tested whether the addition of activated carbon media to sand filters would improve the removal of caffeine from drinking water. Chromatography columns were used as a laboratory-scale model for the slow sand filters that are found in drinking water plants. If the addition of sorbents like activated carbon to sand filters is effective at removing some pharmaceuticals and personal care products, some treatment plants may be able to avoid high cost processes including membrane filtration and advanced oxidation. 

In Literature and Medicine, we studied the physical and emotional aspects of illness, patient-doctor relationships, and societal views of medical professions and we were faced with the task of creating a project examining a specific aspect of these broad issues. Although the original purpose of our studies was to expand our understanding of our selected topics, i.e. depression/madness, AIDS (and the parallels to the current Ebola crisis), and music therapy in the context of healing, through research, our projects transformed into records of our journeys documenting how we made peace with these issues. Brought together by the course and by our common experience of personal reconciliation during research, writing, and introspection, in this panel we will present the knowledge we acquired and the personal experiences that shaped our views.

The World Health Organization has called for global eradication of Polio by 2018, but the disease remains endemic in three countries. Nigeria, one of these countries, presents a particularly interesting problem in eradicating the disease due to its fast-growing population and median age of 18. This research uses population models to predict the best vaccine intervention protocols and investigate the burden of disease in the country based on this atypical population structure. Further study of the model also provides a framework for how to defend communities against future Polio outbreaks. Special thanks to Dr. Jay Walton of Texas A&M University for overseeing this project.

As prostate cancer cells lose sensitivity towards androgens, the effect of gonadotropic releasing hormone (GnRH), becomes more important as a growth factor in cell proliferation. The enzyme thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) has the potential to break down and thus attenuate the effects of GnRH and other peptide growth factors. TOP plays an important regulatory role in steroid hormone production, and may have implications for treatment of prostate cancer. In order to analyze the effects of TOP in the cell proliferation process, androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells were treated with dihydrotestosterone or GnRH. TOP activity was measured with a quenched fluorescence assay and TOP localization was determined by confocal fluorescence imaging. Quantification of TOP levels was obtained via immunoblot. Results demonstrate an increase in TOP levels and activity after treatment with GnRH. This tentatively suggests that GnRH exerts negative feedback on its own activity.

Does free and fair trade benefit the workers in an industry? My thesis aims to investigate this question in the context of the Multifiber Arrangement, a system of quotas established in 1974 to protect the textiles industries in developed countries by restricting cheaper imports from developing countries. Uplifting of these quotas mandated by the WTO between 1995 and 2005, therefore, meant opportunities for greater textile production in internationally-competitive developing economies such as India, where the textile industry accounts for over 4.5% of global production and is the second largest generator of employment after agriculture. In labor intensive industries, an increase in production should further mean more employment, higher wages and improved livelihood. Using variation in the pre-agreement industry mix across states in India, my thesis examines the impacts of the MFA phase-outs on textile production for exports, and a subsequent impact on development indicators such as employment, poverty, and inequality.

On March 17, 2011, the United States and NATO authorized military intervention in Libya on humanitarian grounds to help protect Libyan citizens. Four years later, Libya has descended further into chaos, which has directly affected the region. My research explains why the intervention in Libya may be considered a failure and the extent to which the legacy of the intervention accounts for the country’s current state. Despite good intentions, Libya is another case for why humanitarian intervention is often ineffective. Through the case of Libya, I explore the ongoing debate on humanitarian intervention and its relevance for, not only to future policy, but also to changing norms in international relations.

In 2011, Congress repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell (DADT), allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military. Due to the military’s resistance to DADT’s repeal, it seems soldiers may have a predisposition to heterosexism. If so, the sudden shift in the military’s policies may lead to hostile treatment of gays and lesbians who choose to reveal their sexuality. Few studies have been conducted on soldiers’ and veterans’ opinions of gays and lesbians serving in the military, and none have assessed whether military service causes soldiers and veterans to feel that gays and lesbians shouldn't be allowed to serve. After analyzing 2008 and 2012 ANES data, we found that military service causes veterans to show less support than civilians for allowing gays to serve openly in the military. Given our findings, we suggest that future research be conducted on the group dynamics within the military that may foster heterosexist attitudes.

Engineering for Humanity, an interdisciplinary engineering design and anthropology course, is a semester-long partnership between Three-College students and the Natick Council on Aging. Older community members were recruited to partner with students in a series of discovery, design, and community-building activities. Come hear Babson and Olin students present results of the empathetic design process. During the semester, students and their elder partners engaged in activities designed to create community and understanding. Next, students synthesized what they learned into project ideas, refining briefs into robust, targeted, and manageable projects through consultation with experts and co-design with elder partners. A series of standard design stages -- specification, prototyping, testing, refinement -- was accompanied by visits with partners for feedback and continued learning and community building. Shortly after the Ruhlman conference, partners will receive custom-designed artifacts intended to solve particular problems. (This Olin College class is supported by the Metrowest Health Foundation.)

This year, the Biological Chemistry thesis projects truly spanned the range of the discipline. Some students gravitated towards the chemistry side and aimed to understand how low-energy electrons form biologically relevant compounds in outer space. Other students hovered in the biological realm and attempted to model partial lipodystrophy in stem cell-derived adipocytes. Still others found their interests somewhere in between, by investigating the role of the COW1 protein family in protonemal development, establishing predictive models for lipid binding in SEC14 proteins, or developing transgenic moss lines to help visualize how signalling lipids localize during tip growth.  Wherever on the spectrum their research interest fell, each student relied on a mastery of both biological and chemical concepts, as well as good old-fashioned problem solving. In this panel, five BIOC/BISC thesis students will present their respective findings to collectively demonstrate the relevance of biochemistry in understanding the world around us.
 
How do we choose our friends? What factors do we consider when deciding who would be an engaging social partner? Some factors seem intuitive, such as a shared language, music, or food preferences. Some factors, such as mimicry, are less obvious. People like people who imitate them better than people who do not. Although mimicry often goes unnoticed by people interacting socially, acts of imitation lead to reports of increased likeability. Interestingly, infants make similar judgments when choosing social partners. Infants have a preference for someone who speaks the same language, shares a food preference, or sings a song previously sung by a parent. My research aims to develop our understanding of the basis of mimicry in choosing social partners. The findings from this research may support the theory that imitation is one of the building blocks of knowledge that infants have in regards to choosing social partners.

At the intersection of bodies and technology lies quantified self wearable technology. Part of the movement that bills itself as “self improvement through numbers,” this self-tracking tech is one of the hottest consumer trends of the year, with growing cultural presence. I analyze this technology through three lenses: first, as a method of consumerist reenchantment; second, as part of the modern project of self actualization through therapeutic methods; and third, as a space for negotiation between utopian dreams and dystopian fears. Through this analysis, I interpret what quantified self wearable technology is as a cultural object, and deepen understanding of the relationship between technology, capitalism, and the self.

This talk will look to pinpoint the influences of eurosceptic parties in the European Union, by focusing on the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and the Danish People's Party (DPP), with regards to the current and future state of European integration. Euroscepticism will be broken down into ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ branches, based on the kinds of impacts suggested by each parties; a ‘soft’ influence over the concern of state sovereignty might be a party's decision to support discourse that is skeptical of a united Europe, while a ‘hard’ influence may be proposing legislative motions to leave the EU on grounds of a lack of accountability between EU institutions and member governments. The talk will conclude by looking forward at the future of Eurosceptic parties, and hypothesizing about their continued impact on EU enlargement and integration, as well as the impacts they will have on their local political systems.  

This presentation describes work to identify trends in STEM education at highly-selective liberal arts colleges in US Northeast and investigate to what extent a liberal arts curriculum can help students’ understanding of their scientific studies.  Using data from a 4-year longitudinal study of STEM majors at various institutions, we identified patterns in students’ coursework between the liberal arts and sciences and correlated this with student engagement and success outcomes.

Our class, The Science and Culture of Blood (ANTH/CHEM 107), focused on the anthropology and chemistry of blood, something that most people seem to actively avoid despite its prevalence in our everyday lives. Cross-culturally, blood acts as a symbol, and in some cases, a powerful taboo. Our presentation combines social science and natural science as a means of unpacking the significance of such a common substance. From an anthropological perspective, we explore the near-universal taboo of menstrual blood. Menstrual taboos exist almost everywhere and are sometimes manifested in material forms such as the menstrual isolation huts used in parts of rural Nepal. Looking at blood through the lens of chemistry, the tainted blood and the blood doping scandals are used to examine why, on a microscopic scale, blood becomes a contentious issue. Discussions of blood from these vastly different disciplines illuminates why blood is truly the stuff of our lives.

This transnational feminisms panel examines key feminist concerns and debates—feminist epistemology, issues of representation, agency and subjectivity, capitalism, patriarchy, post-colonialism and nationalism, globalization, development, migration, and incarceration. These topics will be explored by the students who conducted research projects while enrolled in the transnational feminisms Fall 2014 course. Specific research topics include: politics of representation, visual pedagogies, and post-9/11 institutional memory, the intersections of law, sexual justice, and higher education, multinational corporations and neo-colonialism, the War on Drugs (an analysis of its history, impact, and alternatives), an examination of western feminism as it intersects with statehood and motherhood.
The relationship between the United States and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is arguably one of the most delicate bilateral relationships both historically and in the present day. The chilly diplomatic relationship between the PRC and the United States from 1949 to 1969 is often taken for granted. However, a strategic analysis suggests that there were several points in the 1960s at which the PRC and the United States might have been expected to reconcile with each other. Why, then, did confrontations between the PRC and the United States persist throughout the 1960s even when the USSR seemed more threatening to both the PRC and the United States than each was to the other? This presentation will address this question by testing traditional balancing theories as well as alternative explanations, such as the role of ideology and domestic politics, in preventing and shaping the 1972 Sino-U.S. rapprochement. 

In 1992 about half of emergency department (ED) patients sought non-urgent care (Baker and Baker, 1994; Williams, 1996). At the time, the television show “ER” popularized the term “GOMER,” which means “Get Out of my Emergency Room” in order to describe the vast number of patients who visited the ED without a need for emergency services. As a result of a number of health economic trends and forces, only 8-12% of patients in the ED today seek non-urgent care (NHAMCS, 2011). We examine the factors behind this drastic decrease and debunk the myth that non-urgent patients alone cause EDs to be overpriced, over-packed, and overused. Certainly, there is room to reduce health care spending due to non-urgent ED visits (and we discuss the current efforts to do so), but many current economic calculations of average and marginal costs grossly overestimate the potential for savings.

I examined friendship formation in preschool-aged children by identifying social processes observed at Time 1 related to friendship outcomes at Time 2. I focused on “unilateral” dyads, pairs of children in which only one child has nominated the other as a friend. These relationships include interest in friendship but not yet fully, reciprocated friendship.  Seventy-four preschoolers participated in this study. Unilateral dyads were identified from sociometric interviews, and observed during a 10-minute dramatic play session.  Teachers reported the amount of time dyads spent together and their common activities. I had three hypotheses: unilateral friendships that develop into reciprocal friendships would 1) speak more to each other and make more mutual/partner play statements, noncompliant/disapproving statements, and commands/requests 2) be characterized by greater cohesiveness, harmony, responsiveness, inclusiveness, and coordinated play 3) spend more time together and engage in more common activities than those dyads that remain unilateral or become non-friend relationships.

For the past four years, an anonymous Twitter project titled WellesleyProbz has documented, engaged with, and critically analyzed Wellesley's on-campus culture. The project raises important questions about the complicated persona known as Wendy Wellesley, how storytelling can connect communities through feelings of shared experience, and how social media can be used as a method for documenting, preserving, and enriching historical records. WellesleyProbz models the popular online satirical meme First World Problems, which highlights social dynamics including power, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, norms, and human behavior. On Twitter, WellesleyProbz has acquired over 1,300 followers in four years, and has high user engagement from students, faculty, alumnae, and residents of the town of Wellesley - even Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright! The presentation will use sociology and anthropology as frameworks to address how WellesleyProbz can be used as an analytical tool, as well as serve as a method of documentation and preservation.

Given my diverse background, I wanted to develop a thesis that reflected my various interests in music and science. I discovered the thrill and freedom of electronic music in my junior year, and this sound installation, “Euler”, is an exploration of the intersections present between math, music, and nature. I found with continued investigation that these three aspects are intrinsically connected, which can be shown musically through careful compositional techniques. Using sounds recorded from nature, including sounds I recorded on my trip to the rainforests of Costa Rica this winter, I had my “notes” to form my composition, and my responsibility was then the same as any other composer: create something that evokes thought or emotions from sounds. With this interactive sound installation, I hope to pass the proverbial baton to the audience so they themselves can act as composers and surround themselves in a rich sound and visual space.

Johannes Brahms’s first piano trio, Op. 8 in B Major, was originally composed in 1854, (the same year Robert Schumann attempted suicide) when Brahms was only 21, and revised and republished nearly 40 years later. Although Brahms claimed he “did not provide the trio with a wig, but just combed and arranged its hair a little,” his edits were extensive and reflect his development as a composer. We will present a historical, harmonic and structural analysis of Brahms’s first published chamber work and be performing the 1890 revised version.

Last semester, Wellesley instituted a shadow grading policy for the incoming first-year class. This new policy creates a kind of buffer zone for students in that first semester grades are not recorded on their official transcripts, only marks of Pass or No Pass. Shadow grading was adopted with the hope that new students would focus less on grades and more on curricular exploration and risk taking. In addition, the new policy was meant to encourage greater balance between academics and social activities as students make the complicated transition from high school to college. But did shadow grading accomplish these lofty goals? Did first-year students take more risks and experience less stress than they had anticipated because of shadow grading? Through a combination of survey and interview data from first-year students, I will discuss the pluses and minuses of shadow grading from the point of view of the Class of 2018. 

In light of the current woes of the Eurozone, it is easy to forget the excitement at the inception of the European Monetary Union fifteen years ago. Eurozone countries willingly forfeited their own currency and monetary policy autonomy to join the currency union, lauding its apparent benefits. The collapse of the U.S. housing market in 2007, however, exposed weaknesses in the structure of the Euro area. Countries within the EMU faced different sets of macroeconomic conditions, rendering the ECB incapable of implementing the optimal policy for each member country. Defining economic stress as the difference between the ECB policy rate and the ideal policy rate in an EMU country (had it monetary policy autonomy), I quantify each country’s stress as well as examine how each country’s stress affects ECB policy and vice versa.

On an ecological scale, introduced species can cause the dislocation and possible extinction of resident species. At a genetic level, hybridization with endemic species can cause the endemic or resident species to lose important adaptations. The weevil Galapaganus howdenae proliferated after its human-mediated introduction to Santa Cruz island in the Galápagos Archipelago from continental Ecuador. Two endemic close relatives inhabit Santa Cruz Island: Galapagnus conwayensis and Galapaganus ashlocki. Although there is no morphological evidence for hybridization between G. h. howdenae and endemic species, its expansion to the highlands of Santa Cruz demonstrates the weevils’ ability to invade other areas. In order to understand G. h. howdenae’s invasive impact in Santa Cruz, we explore both its invasive history and the potential for interspecies hybridization, using phylogeography methods and comparing mitochondrial and nuclear interspecies gene flow, respectively.

Are college students’ perceptions of their socioeconomic status (SES) related to increased mental health problems? This study
explored a recently- developed concept: perceived SES, defined as one’s perceptions of SES in relation to immediate peers, and its relation to objective SES, well-being, and inauthenticity. Participants completed measures of well-being in order to determine whether
lower perceived SES would be related to higher rates of depression and social anxiety symptoms. Lower perceived SES was significantly correlated with increased symptoms of depression, but not increased social anxiety symptoms. Additionally, inauthenticity in college relationships partially mediated the relation between perceived SES and depression. These findings may be useful for promoting a more inclusive community in college.

An analysis of various national and international space missions reveals how public-led grassroots movements affect public policy and government funding. The Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, International Sun-Earth Explorer 3, and others reveal trends that correspond to new models of the academic research cycle in the digital age. With the advent of crowd-funding and crowd-sourcing, space initiatives have shifted away from being under the sole jurisdiction of governmental agencies and corporations, creating a space for innovators and amateur astronomers. This changing landscape in policy has the potential to expand our capabilities and deepen our understanding of the universe.

My research explores how a national museum is used as cultural strategy for urban development and national identity building. Throughout history, the national museum has  functioned as a pillar of culture, and by extension the rhetoric of the nation in itself. Drawing from the history of national museums' origins that emerged in Europe, but today pertains to nearly every country in the world, I consider the new National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo as a case study to analyse the questions surrounding this politcal nexus.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is an increasingly popular policy strategy for addressing the challenges of waste management and recovery. EPR requires manufacturers of a designated product (e.g. paint, tires, or batteries) to pay for that good's end-of-life management costs. EPR programs are intended to produce net positive environmental impacts by encouraging product manufacturers to pursue sustainable waste management practices, including recycling. Four existing EPR policies for single-use batteries in the European Union (EU), Canada, and U.S. have attempted to achieve these net environmental benefits. While the laws are an important step towards battery waste management, they do not contain adequate provisions to ensure that the policies achieve net environmental benefits. In fact, the environmental burdens of recycling may exceed the benefits. For EPR policies to be effective, they need to consider the environmental consequences associated with each part of a product's life-cycle, from production and manufacture to collection and recycling.

In recent years, a growing number of researchers have suggested that rising income inequality in the United States has created a ‘hollowing-out’ of the middle class, largely as a result of increasing wealth accumulation at the very top. Eager to combat the perception that they contribute to this inequality, many elite private colleges and universities have sought to attract greater socioeconomic diversity. But such diversity poses many challenges to traditional approaches to need- and merit-based financial aid, tuition, and campus investment. 

In particular, I will argue in this presentation that there has been an increase in demand for high-income students, whose families often subsidize the enrollment of low- and middle-income students. Implications of this changing strategy include the rise of an ‘educational arms race’—in which institutions compete to enroll the best (and, at times, wealthiest) students by funding non-academic services (e.g. luxury dorms)—and the risk of relying on such policies to establish socioeconomic diversity.  
How does what we see on TV impact the way we view the world? Using emperical data from Linda Charmaraman's national media and identity survey and historical to contemporary texts, this presentation will examine the diversity of mainstream TV and how it impacts voter turnout. 

Love is an eternal theme of poetry across languages and cultures, but it has always been difficult to convey such a vigorous sentiment through translation due to a poem's cultural specificity and a language's grammatical constraints, most notably its acoustic qualities. The struggle that translators often confront is often between presenting a poem with literal accuracy and preserving its holistic beauty. Members of Wellesley in Translation will share their translated work of selected love poems from Chinese, Spanish and Korean literature as well as the choices they make during the translation process.

My thesis examines the role of American occupation in Iraq,
beginning in 2003 until complete combat removal in 2011, on Iraqi-based non-governmental organizations with humanitarian focuses.  Utilizing a historical-comparative approach, the thesis explores Iraq's humanitarian organizations on a regional level, comparing the northern Kurdish region and the southern predominately Shiite region, both of which were demarcated as no-fly zones by the US, UK, and France after the Gulf War of 1991, with the heavily
invaded middle region that experienced the majority of American combat forces.  Data collection entails a series of interviews with current members of Iraqi NGOs and officials of such American-based organizations as the United States Institute of Peace and USAID.  Extensive literature review of reports conducted by international and Iraqi NGOs are also be examined to best assess the level of improvement of Iraqi humanitarian organizations, or lack thereof, during the aforementioned time interval.  While primarily focusing on Iraq, this thesis ultimately aims to illuminate the effect military intervention can have on an occupied country's humanitarian sector, a crucial element of its broader civil society.

The research I hope to present at the Ruhlman Conference is on the rituals and laws of menstruation in Judaism.  These rituals and laws were first introduced in the Torah as part of the laws of family purity, or niddah.  These laws commanded that menstruating women not participate in certain activities, such as sexual intercourse, and outlined a purification process that women must undergo after they finish their menstrual period.  Today there is a significant range in the way in which the rituals and laws of menstruation are kept among the main three denominations of Ashkenazi Judaism and in Sephardic Judaism.  Additionally, there is now a movement of Jewish feminism that attempts to combine the laws of niddah and feminist ideals.  My research for this project consisted of a review of liturgical and academic texts, interviews and a survey of Jewish students at Wellesley College.  

My study investigated the long-term implication of adolescence narcissism on psychological and physical health in late adulthood (age 70s). I used longitudinal data from the Institute of Human Development at University of California, Berkeley study. The study participants, born in the 1920s, were assessed in adolescence and four times in adulthood (ages 30s, 40s, 50s and 70s). Narcissism was measured through observer rating. High narcissism in adolescence was predictive of poor psychological and physical functioning in late adulthood. Poor psychological functioning in late adulthood was particularly characteristic of adolescents who scored high on narcissism and who experiences stressful life events in early to middle adulthood. The link between adolescent narcissism and poor physical health in late adulthood was mediated by alcohol use. The study’s findings reinforce the importance of adolescent personality characteristics for physical and psychological functioning later on in life. 

My research with Professor Sommers Smith is an interdisciplinary project that utilizes statistical models of biological diversity to probe changes in the recorded repertoire of North American traditional fiddle music. I became familiar with the music of Cape Breton Island and experienced the dance and social contexts of the music at Boston-area concerts. Second, I learned to use the Alan Snyder online database of all recordings of Cape Breton traditional fiddle music. Professor Sommers Smith and I identified performers from this database and assessed the diversity of their recorded repertoires using the Shannon model of biodiversity. We are currently working to utilize JMP 10 statistical software to calculate diversity measurements and to display our results. Finally, we will learn to interpret our statistical results and analyze them using ethnomusicological principles of stability and change in traditional music, as well as theories of musical revival and commercialization.  We are learning that a traditional music repertoire can change over a very short period of time.

Impulsivity can contribute to money ?problems? in women through propensities to impulse shop, failures to save, and accumulation of debt. Recently, the effects of a biological factor, fluctuating ovarian hormones across the menstrual cycle, on women’s impulse shopping has been demonstrated. This study will ?further ?investigate the effects of ?the cycle and of ?impulsive tendencies, especially as they relate to decisions about money, on spending ?and shopping behaviors?.  I am also interested in how these ?factors? interact with women’s body image. Finally, mood states will also be assessed.

The VA’s Disability Compensation (VADC) program, which provides cash benefits for qualifying disabled veterans, has been growing rapidly since 2001. The drivers of the program’s growth are not well understood with worsening health as one possible driver, but recent liberalizations of medical eligibility criteria may also play a role. This study deconstructs the recent growth in the VADC program into the share due to worsening veteran health and the share due to other factors. I use NHIS data to estimate the relationship between health and receipt of VADC benefits in the late 1990s, and then use those estimates with the actual health of recent veterans to project the share of today's veterans that would be on the program if eligibility criteria had not changed. Findings may help policy makers as they consider how to balance the needs of wounded veterans against rapidly rising program expenditures.
 
As the Native American Outreach intern at the White House the past 5 months, the presenter learned firsthand the systemic barriers educational achievement Native youth face. Native children are far more likely than their non-Native peers to grow up in poverty, to suffer from severe health problems, and to face obstacles to educational opportunity. The United States shares a unique trust responsibility with Indian tribes built upon treaties. Because of this relationship, the Obama administration is working to find solutions to pressing education problems confronting Native Youth. This presentation takes viewers through several historical cases, successful and unsuccessful, outlining how educational opportunities have been given to Native youth through federal government intervention. Focusing on the work of both Republican and Democratic administrations, this presentation will draw upon these cases and discuss alternative ways advancement can be propelled for Native Youth. The talk will be drawn upon both the presenter's research and firsthand experience working with Native Youth.

Have you ever heard someone claim, “Men are just funnier than women?” When you are in groups with male and female friends, does it seem like the men crack all the jokes while the women are expected to laugh at them? Talk about overanalyzing a joke—this year I have been conducting sociolinguistic research on how powerful and powerless speech styles and gender roles affect the perception of men and women’s humor. Why is it that men have historically been considered funnier than women in many cultures? Some theories in evolutionary biology have compelling explanations for why it is more crucial for men than for women to be funny. But don’t fear! I offer a sociolinguistic perspective on how the gender divide in humor has occurred and reasons for why it may be changing.

In this team-taught course, we learned about the non-profit world, homelessness in 21st century America, and, most important, the giving process, from grant writing to foundation deliberation and award making. The title of the course, as well as its structure, captures its mission: learn about philanthropy and its role in addressing complex social issues through the process of giving a $10,000 grant. Simple enough idea, or is it? How did learning about an issue inform the giving process? This panel will reflect on how the learning process influenced the giving process. 
 
YouTube is the third most visited website in the world. Since 2007, videobloggers such as John Green, Hannah Hart, and Jenna Marbles have amassed followings in the millions, creating vast networked communities of fans of online video. In recent years, over thirty accounts have been published documenting sexual abuse committed by many prominent YouTube personalities. It quickly became apparent that inadequate resources were available to survivors of violence committed within online communities. In response, I helped form a group called YouCoalition dedicated to addressing sexual violence in YouTube and other online communities. Since March of 2014, YouCoalition has been working to combat sexual violence in online communities through innovative grassroots action in order to reach communities not served through traditional resources. In this presentation, I will discuss YouCoalition’s work as well as the nature of online harassment and abuse using a framework of theory surrounding networked communities and networked harm.

In the 20th century, East Asia experienced tremendous economic growth, catching up to their “modern” Western counterparts. With Britain leading the way, the cotton-textile industry and the Industrial Revolution made the “modern” Europe of the 19th and 20th centuries. This modernization and economic growth took place steadily over the course of 300 years, arguably, but in East Asia, particularly in Japan, that growth took about 100 years. This accelerated growth happened not just because of government industrial policy and the push to modernize, but due to companies with private-sector industrial policies and long-term business strategies that suggested a broader industrial development. This can be seen in companies like Mitsui Bussan, whose focus on long-term growth and development meant having industrial policies that not only helped the company but also the still-developing Japanese economy.
An ever-increasing number of North Korean defectors are entering South Korea, but they are still faced with the negative prejudice and attitude prevalent in the society. In this honors thesis project, I examine the North Korean defectors' lives in South Korea through the social labeling imposed by the South Korean media and the self portrayal of the defector narratives. Critical discourse analysis will address various issues, discrepancies, and similarities with respect to the representation of the defectors in South Korea. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, I will compare the language use of the mainstream media (news, fictional TV serious, reality TV shows, and movies) and the newly forming online communities of the defectors and demonstrate how minority stereotypes are (re)produced.

Since 1956, the Asia Society has responded to and furthered U.S. interests in the Asia/Pacific region.  Initially founded to teach Americans about Asia through art and culture, the Society now teaches the globe about Asian/Pacific culture, economics, and politics via their  national and international offices and museums.  To understand the seismic changes at the Society over the past fifty-nine years, and how they reflect changing political and economic interests,I examine its role in cultural diplomacy over time.I untangle the intended and unintended beneficiaries of the Society’s diplomacy to understand how art and culture has been used over time to protect and disrupt geopolitical hierarchies.

Early during development of the plant vascular system, auxin is channeled into narrow, directional pathways due to polar localization of the auxin efflux protein, PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1). An intracellular membrane trafficking process, involving the vascular proteins SFC, VAB1, CVP2, and CVL1, maintains PIN1 localization. Evidence suggests that the Sec14-related proteins, PATELLIN1 and PATELLIN2 (PATL1/2), are involved in vascular development and may play a role in maintaining PIN polarity. To determine whether PATL1/2 influence PIN1 cycling by interacting with the above-mentioned vascular proteins, mutant strains of Arabidopsis thaliana were crossed to produce either double or triple mutant F2 progeny. We determined the PCR conditions for genotyping several vascular mutant alleles. Homozygous recessive double or triple mutant plants that segregate in the F2 generation will be evaluated by their phenotype. If PATL1/2 function in PIN1 polar localization, we expect to observe more severe vascular defects in the double and triple mutants than in the single mutants.

Increasing taxation, reducing benefits, and raising the retirement age are popular topics of debate surrounding the Social Security program. Past research has shown that lower benefits decrease independent living and homeownership, and increase poverty amongst the elderly. However, we know little about how levels of Social Security benefits influence elderly migration and location choice – which may have important implications for the welfare of the elderly, especially if it affects their proximity to their children. With metropolitan housing costs soaring, would lower levels of Social Security benefits force retirees to move from high-cost to low-cost locations? A simple comparison of retirees with higher versus lower benefit levels is problematic since the two groups systematically differ in many ways. I shed light on this question by exploiting the natural experiment of the Social Security “notch” to examine the effects of an exogenous change in Social Security benefits on where the elderly live.

Examining whether Tea Partiers are actually ideologically distinct from those in the Republican Party, and what causes such an anticipated gap will allow us to further explore the Tea Party, its relationship to the GOP, and their futures in American politics. We are interested in resolving these questions, and learning about the ideological composition of Tea Party members. Though some existing literature has predicted a swift end to the Tea Party, much as we’ve seen with the Occupy movement, the Tea Party is still strong today. We want to explore just how this movement has adapted over time, and through this predict what could be in store for their future position in politics. 

Stereotype threat arises from the fear of confirming a negative stereotype about one’s social group, and can interfere with optimal performance. This study explored whether gender identification moderates stereotype threat effects among a sample of cisgender, transgender and gender non-binary students at Wellesley, Smith, and Mount Holyoke. Participants completed measures of gender identity and were then exposed to one of four experimental conditions—no threat, threat based on gender socialization, threat based on gender identity, and threat combined with empowerment. I predicted that empowerment will decrease the effect of stereotype threat on spatial cognition performance, while stronger stereotypical gender identity will increase those effects.

Students of Religion 290: Wintersession in Kyoto will present their respective research papers, which have been the result of academic research combined with collaborative work with students of Japan's Doshisha University. The research topics themselves range from the necessary evolution of Japan's health care system to the treatment of ethnic minorities in modern-day Japan. We hope to present in-depth studies of aspects of Japanese culture, and, together, paint a cohesive image of our time in Japan.

Avocoder is a musical interface, housed in a green 3D-printed case, created for MUS378: Deconstructive Audio (fall 2014). Our interface allows people to manipulate their voices by tangibly varying pitch, volume and distortion. Modern musical synthesizers come with a myriad of preset patches and filters to manipulate pitch and voice, and this abstraction creates an environment for passive interaction with musical interfaces. Rather than accepting presets, we aim to give people the chance to directly and intuitively manipulate parameters of sound with their hands and voice, allowing them to explore sound beyond the paradigm of rigid systems. We hope that people will take away an experience of playing with digital sound and the sound of their own voice in ways they hadn’t before, and that Avocoder encourages them to challenge predefined constraints of modern musical software and instruments. 

The most influential community on Earth may be the microbial community. Fifteen years of research has demonstrated that these diverse assemblages of bacteria, viruses, fungi and archaea play a critical role in shaping their environment, be it the land, sea or the human body. Nevertheless, the dynamic factors that drive interactions and stability within these communities remain relatively poorly understood. At this panel, the Klepac Ceraj lab will take you on a tour of several microbial communities and their environments ranging from the digestive systems of a milkweed bug and a mouse, marine microbial mats, to the permanently stratified depths of a lake. We will describe how we study these microbial communities and discuss recent findings, future goals, and potential ramifications of our research and the importance of environmental microbiology.

Mental illness stigma may act as a deterrent to mental health treatment among members of different cultures. I was interested in examining two types of stigma in the South Asian population: onset responsibility,-stigma that attributes mental illness to individuals’ own negligent behaviors and courtesy stigma, discrimination experienced by family members of individuals with mental illness. My research investigates how cultural values and education in psychology may influence the endorsement of onset responsibility and courtesy stigma. An electronic survey, distributed to a multiethnic sample of students, assessed onset responsibility and courtesy stigma towards two mental illnesses: schizophrenia and depression. I hypothesized that students from different ethnic groups would vary in their endorsement of collectivist values and interdependent self-construals, and these values would be positively associated with courtesy stigma but negatively associated with onset responsibility. Furthermore, I hypothesized that education in psychology would be associated with lower onset responsibility and courtesy stigma.

The Elmore lab is interested in understanding the interactions between lipids and proteins.  One set of projects in the lab consider histone-derived antimicrobial peptides (HDAPs), which have been shown to selectively kill bacterial cells and thus show potential as alternatives to conventional antibiotics.  These projects modify peptide structures, explore the mechanisms of action, and test peptides against different bacterial strains. The interaction between the lipid membrane and these proteins is studied using molecular dynamics simulations.  Another area of study is the characterization of lipid binding proteins that have arisen from work with model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrella patens in thePeterman lab.  Panel members will discuss the various computational and experimental methods they use to address these questions and the insights their approaches have provided to these systems.

The following study analyzed the different ways a particular petroleum platform, Pozo Sacha 480, run by the company, Operaciones Río Napo CEM, affected an indigenous community in the Ecuadorian Amazon Basin, called Loma del Tigre. Among the different aspects studied are the environmental impacts on the water quality of the local river, a once commonly used water-source for the community, and the impacts on the air quality. In order to test the water quality of the river, three different sites were chosen for macroinvertebrate collection. Macroinvertebrates are among the best indicators of water quality due to their ability to sustain life in pollution-ridden waters. Results showed that the species collected from the river were categorized under Moderately Tolerant and Tolerant, hence contributing to the poor water quality of the water-source due to petroleum industry activities. Air quality was tested using hand-made air filters designed to capture particulate matter in the air. Filters were set up in four different sites around the community. By comparing the results of the air filters to a standard Air Quality Index (AQI), one was able to see that the air quality in the community was under the category: “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups.” Lastly, 25 community members were interviewed and asked to complete a survey to analyze the social and cultural impacts the industry has on the community. The results showed that community members have uncertainty regarding the petroleum industry; many are aware of the environmental and health impacts, but know there are temporary economic benefits that can prove helpful. 

In the Fall 2014 ARTH 316 seminar exploring race and gender in contemporary art, three Wellesley students chose to research objects created by artists of color in the Davis Museum, while a fourth created her own performance piece. Sabrina Giglio '15 will discuss her experiences interviewing John Woodrow Wilson, famous for his many renderings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Courtney Jackson '15 will explore Adrian Piper, and her attempt to show viewers what it means to be a colored woman artist fighting to create subjective work and gain recognition in the art world through her oeuvre. Zoe Schreiber will examine Edward and Nancy Reddin Kienholz' Sawdy, a mixed media assemblage in which the Kienholz include the viewer to enables them to comment on the legacies of racial violence in post­-Civil Rights Movement America. Last, Anneliese Klein '15 will address her 2014 original performance piece, I Am The Alien Interloper. 

Notch receptors constitute a family of type I transmembrane glycoproteins that play an integral role in signaling for normal cellular development, including adult homeostasis and stem cell maintenance in an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway.  In this study, we investigated the structural composition and stability of two isolated peptides corresponding to helix 3 in human Notch1 and Notch2 using circular dichroism spectroscopy.  This work represents the initial step in identifying the relative importance of specific LNR-HD interfacial contacts in stabilizing helix 3 and offering a mechanistic understanding for its critical role in the autoinhibitory interdomain interactions.   

After Summer 2015’s Operation Protective Edge, more students than ever before are joining the Palestine solidarity movement. How will this movement contribute to peace, justice and stability in Israel-Palestine and how does it fare in comparison with past and current student-led campaigns for social justice on US campuses? This talk will thoroughly explain the reasons for, and goals of student activism for Palestine, place the this solidarity movement in the broader context of campus activism in the United States (and at Wellesley College), and critique the efficacy of the activities through which this movement strives to achieve its goals. Ultimately, we will demonstrate the importance of  campus advocacy and activism for providing students the opportunity to practice skills they gain in the classroom; more broadly, we will show how the student-led solidarity movement for Palestine can, and is, contributing to the improvement of social, political and economic conditions in the region.

There are 35.3 million people living with HIV/AIDS, with 1.6 million deaths from AIDS annually. But the prevalence rate and mortality rate are not evenly distributed internationally as 95% of HIV infections occur in the developing world. The HIV epidemic varies dramatically from country to country; for instance the estimated HIV prevalence rate in Thailand is 1.1% yet it is as high as 17.9% in South Africa. Some countries respond swiftly to the epidemic, while other countries take many years to initiate a meaningful response. Why does the overall HIV outcome and response vary dramatically from country to country? Although I originally hypothesized that democratic governments face greater pressure from their citizens to address the HIV epidemic, and thus would have a stronger response, I have found that this is often not the case. I have found that autocratic countries can respond highly effectively, while democratic countries struggle. 

The Egyptian Revolution of 2011 is widely regarded as a failure. Egyptians and international observers argue that Egypt’s inability to establish a stable, democratic government and the ascendance of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi indicate a return to an oppressive dictatorship like Hosni Mubarak’s. I seek to uncover the assumptions regarding power and revolution that are implicit in this pessimistic analysis of the 2011 Revolution and to then reframe the question of whether the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 was a failure through different theoretical lenses. Using the works of Bertrand de Jouvenel and Hannah Arendt, I identify each theorist’s notions of power and revolution. I subsequently analyze the events of 2011 through the unique perspective of each theorist and, weighing these two contrasting accounts of the Revolution, draw my own conclusions on whether the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 failed or succeeded.

The mechanisms behind cell division in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is mediated by the presence of an exocyst complex and interphase nodes. The exocyst complex is a highly conserved 8-protein subunit complex that functions to tether secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, aiding in exocytosis and polarized cell growth. Additionally, interphase nodes are collections of signaling proteins that play a critical role in regulating cell division by recruiting protein kinases to the center of the cell, initiating the onset of ring constriction. However, the localization and concentration of individual protein subunits and combined effects of certain protein deletions remain unclear. By further understanding the combined roles of the exocyst and interphase nodes in S. pombe through quantitative microscopy, we can gain insight into the basic cellular processes of secretion, polarized growth, and specific mechanisms behind cell division that go awry in human diseases such as cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders.

Visualization is a key technique for analyzing and presenting complex scientific information across disciplines. This becomes increasingly important when such data must be presented to decision-makers and to the general public in an easily-understandable way. Combining our interest in the application of computer science to economics and to climate change, we investigate how different interactive visualizations affect non-expert understanding of complex scientific data. In economics, different visualizations can impact the way consumers perceive their own spending habits relative to their peers’. Similarly, in climate change research, the disconnect between experts and non-experts raise important questions about how visualizations can affect the communication of information to the general public. Here, we present two relatedprojects, which focus on designing and developing interactive visualizations to promote the accessibility of complex information.

Kern County is located at the southern end of California's Central Valley, with a population of 900,000, 49% which identify as Latino. The county has a rich history with oil and agriculture, and has been portrayed by authors such as John Steinbeck in his famous book, The Grapes of Wrath. While notable authors have written about the county the influence that Latinos had remain to be widely recognized. But since the  1965 grape strike Chican@ leadership has been present in the valley. Dolores Huerta who fought beside Cesar Chavez in the fight to end injustice for farm workers helped pave the path for other Latinas to be strong sources of leadership in their community. Today Latinas hold public office, are assembly members, lawyers and college graduates. I will present my research on the current state of Latina Leadership in Kern County and the impact they have had on their community.

One way to confront instances of institutionalized racism is to work in a community of individuals who experience such racism, and to listen to their voices, which are regularly marginalized. Listening is not enough to correct the prejudices and inequalities that exist, but it is a necessary start. I have been fortunate to work at Brookside Community Health Center in Jamaica Plain since summer 2014. Brookside’s mission is to promote health and well-being in the local community, with a special emphasis on the needs of individuals and groups who experience economic, cultural or other barriers to health care. I intend to focus my research on how discrimination of those who identify as African American, has been experienced within the healthcare system. I plan to interview five community members who use Brookside; I will seek to identify common themes among the interviews which speak to the health disparities among minorities. I will also examine and reflect upon my positionality as someone who identifies as being white with a Wellesley education, and representing a relatively privileged socioeconomic stratum. In this way, I aim to learn about the experiences of others, and learn how to listen to others in order to provide competent care.
 
Despite having made headway towards completing the Millennium Development Goals, Tanzania continues to struggle with gender disparities. The socio-political, historical, and residual patriarchal government influences the burden on Tanzanian women.  A highly disproportionate number of women continue to face inequalities and inequities in areas of health, education, child/forced marriages, and mortality.  Constructed social norms perpetuate violence against women. If we truly believe that, ”A world that is good for women is good for everyone” how can feminist principles be ethically employed in a variety of contexts? What should we consider acts of feminism?
 
Frustration is an emotion that many can relate (e.g. sitting in rush hour traffic or struggling on a problem set). However, what we fail to realize, is that emotions such as frustration have severe implications for cognition and may even shape our motivation. As students, emotion and motivation are central to our everyday experiences and our ability to learn. Some studies have shown that experiencing frustration during homework significantly decreases students’ motivation to persist on an assignment. To date, no studies have examined the effect frustration has on motivation and persistence outside of homework. This project evaluates how level of induced frustration (high vs. low) during a primary computer task, impacts subsequent: 1) motivation to persist on a secondary task, 2) ratings of interest and enjoyment on the second task, and 3) willingness to come back and do the same or similar tasks again in the future.

The personality dimension introversion-extraversion and the many measures of happiness are much debated areas of psychological interest. Universally accepted conceptualizations of both introversion-extraversion and happiness have, thus far, not been determined. The present research reviewed and empirically examined the various facets of introversion-extraversion (social, thinking, anxious, and restrained) and the many aspects of happiness and individual well-being (hedonia, eudiamonia, affect, life satisfaction, self-esteem, depression, contentment, and enjoyment of leisure activities) among a sample of six hundred Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. 
What happens when you try to mix thermodynamic system modeling with ethical, political, or religious behavior? Can you draw a concept map summarizing the collapse of an island society? How does one take a systems approach to dealing with all the realms of social justice and environmental status? Last semester professors Rob Martello (History of Science and Technology, Olin College) Dan Brabander (Geosciences and Environmental Studies, Wellesley College) attempted to answer some of these questions in a project-based, transdiciplinary course called Paradigms, Predictions, and Joules: A Historical and Scientific Approach to Energy and the Environment (PPJ). As a new sustainability certificate program course, PPJ prioritized developing a transferable set of tools and attitudes (ranging from quantitative modeling to ethics) applicable to sustainability studies. In this session, students will present about projects from the course ranging from concept map development to modeling past or present societies’ qualitative and quantitative sustainability. You’ll also hear about the open-ended “Change the World” assignments, strong personal (intrinsic) motivation projects aimed at producing tangible environmental impacts, which have expanded course themes beyond the walls of the classroom.

This Ruhlman presentation will be based on the Women’s and Gender studies class “Politics of Sexuality.” We studied and analyzed the sociopolitical and cultural manifestations of sexuality with a transnational lens. Our research topics varied in both geographical location and scope. Sofie researched divisions within the LGBTQ community at Wellesley College based on race and gender. Nisrine talked about the stereotype behind the hyper-sexualized black body as conveyed and perpetuated by white mainstream media. Pet analyzed the performance of sexuality and gender in Thailand. Aline examined the direct relationship between visibility and violence against queer people in Brazil. We will each discuss our respective areas of research, and their juxtaposition and interplay will demonstrate the key role of sexuality when it comes to understanding local and global politics, institutional policies, and cultural norms.

Invasive plants have become a global phenomenon and can aggressively encroach upon native plant populations. Studying invasive plant species allow us to understand how and to what extent they can alter local ecosystems. We examined the annual grass, Bromus tectorum, which is native to Eurasia and is well established in the United States. It is highly invasive in the Western U.S., especially in the Great Basin area, yet few studies have examined it in the East. In our study, we looked at its invasive potential on Cape Cod. Specifically, we analyzed the population dynamics of B. tectorum in a coastal dune ecosystem, including seed production and dispersal, survival, and seedling establishment. We also conducted community sampling in order to understand how B. tectorum interacts with its surrounding species. Our results reveal substantial variation in population growth, but with the capacity for rapid annual growth. Moderate soil disturbance strongly increased seedling establishment with important population-level consequences. Additionally, particular plant species were associated with the presence or absence of B. tectorum. An important goal going forward is to continue to monitor population dynamics and to test whether our observations have predictive power elsewhere on Cape Cod.

Humans re-design ecosystems all the time, mostly unintentionally, whenever we alter landscapes.  In our course, BISC/ES 327: The Biology of Natural and Designed Ecosystems, we seek to understand healthy, resilient natural ecosystems as communities of diverse organisms, and to apply that understanding to the intentional design of ecosystems.  We will present a sampling of our final projects, which range from restoration of degraded natural systems to design of indoor ecosystems.

Missed either of The Wellesley College Shakespeare Society productions this year? Fear not! Join them as they present scenes from this year's productions, The Tempest and Hamlet both directed by Katherine Suchyta. A talk-back will follow with the director and various members of the casts and technical artists on topics ranging from student-run productions, gender and performance, Shakespeare in the modern day, and the history of the Shakespeare Society. 

Routine vaccination has played a critical role in increasing juvenile life expectancy and eradicating diseases. However, many vaccine delivery systems have not yet capitalized on our current understanding in the adaptive immune response. Recently identified toll-like receptors (TLRs) provide promising targets for novel vaccine delivery. We hypothesize that nanoparticles engineered to deliver a TLR agonist and antigen in a controlled-release manner to antigen-presenting cells (APC) can stimulate the immune system. The nanoparticle will be endocytosed and degraded by APCs, including dendritic cells (DCs), which will become activated to present the desired antigen on their surface. Nanoparticle size ensures localized delivery of the contents to the secondary lymphoid organs. Polymeric poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) / poly(lactic acid)-TLR-agonist (PLGA-PEG/PLA-TLR agonist) nanoparticles are attractive for this vaccination system because of their size, biodegradability, biocompatibility, controlled-release, and stability. Our PLGA-PEG/PLA-TLR agonist nanoparticle vaccines have been shown to augment antigen presentation and co-stimulatory DC molecule production for model protein ovalbumin and to mount an antigen-specific CD8+ na•ve cell-proliferation in vitro. In vivo, our vaccines have been shown to increase the antigen-specific adaptive immune response for both the cell-mediated and humoral branches while reducing systemic toxicity, in comparison to soluble adjuvant. Our findings demonstrate the clinical potential for safe, yet effective delivery of novel TLR adjuvants and polymeric nanoparticles towards the development of effective and low-cost vaccines.

Children today grow up surrounded by technology. The term 21st century learning has become a buzzword, as teachers and parents rush to incorporate technology into their childrenÕs daily activities to enhance their learning experience. In particular, e-readers (electronic readers) have become a common tool found in classrooms and at homes. This study used an experimental design to investigate the effect of electronic readers (e-readers) on 3- to 5-year-oldsÕ comprehension of stories, specifically with relation to their recall of factual and mental state information in the absence of an adult. The sample of participants included children of low and high socioeconomic status (SES) to determine how e-readers affect childrenÕs recall abilities given children from low SES experience less shared book reading time than there high SES peers.

How is the 1979 Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua portrayed in selected official government speeches and works of poetry published by key intellectuals between 1970 and 1990? How do these representations square with or differ from the personal recollections of Nicaraguan citizens today who lived through that era? Through close readings of diverse cultural narratives, I hope to show that Nicaraguans have configured and refigured events in order to manage and understand the transformations they lived through as individuals and as a nation.

The effect of health insurance coverage on financial outcomes such as bankruptcy is a relevant topic in light of recent federal reforms overhauling the healthcare system. Previous research have explored how state laws affect insurance rates among young people and how increases in health insurance coverage impacts the utilization of medical services. I aim to explore how expansions in insurance through Medicaid, State Childrens Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and parental coverage laws may affect ones likelihood of bankruptcy. Using state-level and individual-level data, I employ an instrumental variable model to investigate how these expansions in state laws affect health insurance coverage, and I use these results to find the effect of health insurance coverage on financial outcomes (defined as bankruptcy and investment income).

Within the U.S., there is a striking correlation between income inequality and infant mortality rate by state.  My thesis investigates whether there is a causal relationship behind this correlation, or whether the two variables are related for another reason.  To study this, I am using birth and infant death certificates as well as data on income inequality constructed from the Census. Because the U.S. has unusually high income inequality and infant mortality rates compared with other developed countries, if there is a causal relationship between the two it would have important implications for health policy in the U.S.

In today's society, conspicuous consumption discretely guides almost all of our purchasing decisions, particularly when shopping for attire. For young men, sneaker culture dictates a large majority of their fashion decisions, with entire clothing lines being sculpted from the foundation of a popular gym shoe. For example, the Air Jordans brand has proliferated urban fashion trends ever since its 1989 introduction into popular culture via a commercial entitled It's Gotta Be the Shoes starring Michael Jordan and Spike Lee. In my research, I question whether affinity for and identification with the Air Jordans brand (specifically: the Jordan shoe line) can be determined according to racial background and cultural tradition. Attend my 2014 Ruhlman presentation to witness the results!
This paper characterizes the optimal contract offered by a linear pricing monopolist that faces two-type consumers whose heterogeneity is represented by two parameters in a non-exclusive market. Contrary to conventional wisdom that price discrimination is feasible only when it's not possible for an arbitrageur to equalize the price, I show that screening of different types is possible with fully linear price schedule. Efficient allocations involve distortions away from the first best, which are attributable to the convexification constraints that are the non-exclusive, linear-pricing analog of canonical incentive compatibility constraints.
Over the summer I interned in the fashion department of Redbook Magazine of the Hearst Corporation. There I worked both in the Fashion closet assisting with stories and on the website, creating online flipbooks such as trending swimwear, summer dresses, handbags, and fall boots.

During my many projects one of the things that kept coming up was how difficult it was for women to find the right clothing size for them and that in fact many women wear the wrong size without even realizing it. To highlight this, in the October issue of Redbook we worked on a best fit denim story. We had 20 women come to the office for a Denim Bar party to help them find a good pair of jeans. We assembled 600 pairs of jeans from 20 different brands in sizes 00-24. Even in this situation with so many different sizes and brands available it was difficult for the women to find even two pairs of jeans that fit them well. Based on this experience, I decided to design and create a mobile phone app to help women find their right size in different brands. It will run on the android platform.
The user is asked to take three measurements of her body (bust, waist, hips) and enter them in the app. Based on these measurements and the sizing information provided by clothing companies, the program decides the right size for her in different clothing brands, and presents the results. The app also gives her the option of setting up an account, where her data will be stored. She can use her login credentials to access that information any time in the future. To make this app, I had to introduce myself to and learn how to use MITÕs app inventor.  In the next few months I plan to extend my application by incorporating source crowding. My plan is to use the working version of this app with Wellesley women, part of the intended audience, to verify my algorithms and the results they produce. In addition this might prove to be an alternative way of deciding oneÕs size in different brands, without even the need for taking oneÕs measurements.  This would make for a much more user-friendly app.

My hope is that this application will make it just a bit easier and faster for women to find clothes that fit them better.
Each year the FDA approved a list of drugs based on their qualification standards. I focused on  examining the chemical structure of these drugs and their metabolisms involving the CYP 3A4 enzyme in the liver, noticing if the 3A4 enzyme had any trends in its metabolism patterns of drugs. The mechanism of the CYP 3A4 enzyme aims to convert the initial drug into more water-soluble metabolites in order to be more readily excreted through urine. I looked at the various functional groups on the drug that were being changed through the metabolic process in order to see if I could detect any particular trends in the way CYP3A4 metabolizes drugs.
For my Spanish Honors Thesis I decided to combine my two majors (Spanish and Medieval/Renaissance Studies) by doing a comparison of two literary heroes, one from England and the other from Spain. Most people know about Robin Hood, and his story is still a popular choice for Hollywood movies. The Cid is very prominent in Spain, and is interestingly a real historical figure that had an impact on Spanish history. I chose to compare these two heroes because they are not what you would conventionally imagine heroes to be. Robin Hood is a thief and an outlaw, and The Cid was a mercenary who switched allegiances multiple times during his lifetime. However, in spite of some not so glorious details in their legends, both figures became national heroes, and a source of national pride and identity. This fascinating outcome makes them a perfect source of comparison.

Early peer relationships and interactions are crucial for socio-emotional development. Yet not all peer relationships are the same; some dyads have strong and supportive characteristics and constitute true friendships, whereas other pairs are playmates, providing companionship but little intimacy. I was interested in the extent to which children distinguish between friends and playmates. In addition, many peer relationships in preschool are unilateral, meaning that one child recognizes another as a friend, but that recognition is not reciprocated. These unilateral relationships may be understood by children as playmates. I looked at whether preschool children understood the differences in peer relationships using a story that featured characters that had a range of relationship levels with the protagonist. Subsequently, children were interviewed about relationships with real peers. I hypothesized that children would distinguish between playmates and friends, that real friends would be associated with emotional support, and that playmates would provide companionship more than non-friends.

How does exposure to violence affect political behavior? How do mass shootings (like Newtown, CT and Aurora, CO) affect voter turnout and political preferences? Julie and I have be conducting research on the history of mass shootings in the United States that took place in the past 20 years, focusing particularly on events that occured at schools and universities. Using several research sources (primarily LexisNexis), we recorded key information for each event (address of location, type of location, number of victims) into a spreadsheet to create a dataset of all shootings. We will then use ArcGis to compare mass shooting data to different factors (such as population wealth, how many shops selling firearms are in the area). Ultimately, the key information about the mass shootings will merge with data about public opinion and voter turnout to better understand political attitude and behavior after exposure to the mass shooting. In addition, we have been researching and summarizing the available literature concerning the psychological and political effects of mass shootings.

My research is primarily an examination of personification and narrative technique in chemistry education at the high school and undergraduate level. (Example: a professor says so the electrons want to do this or oxygen is happy when...) The first portion of the research is simply learning more about different academic perspectives on when this technique is appropriate/helpful/beneficial to students, and when it's considered inappropriate and unprofessional. Application to constructivism vs. positivism theory is included here. Specifically, I examine the intersection between the traditionally positivist nature of chemistry and the constructivist nature of effective education.
The second portion of the research relates personification and narrative technique to a feminist view on education. More specifically, some schools of thought suggest that women have different ways of knowing compared to men. (At the risk of reinforcing a stereotype, I examine the tendency of women to learn via relationships, morals/ethics, and caring. However, I do address the stereotype and unfeminist attitude of this research.) The implication here is that women can (sometimes, maybe) be taught differently than men in a way that's more effective in relation to a different learning style.

The research concludes with questions about the potential to create an effective, (possibly radical) introductory chemistry curriculum that embraces, rather than looks down upon, personification and narrative technique. Research supporting the project includes student interviews, professor interviews, high school teacher interviews, shadowing, classic feminist theory research, chemistry education research, and narrative technique research. The project and research was carried out under the guidance of Noah Rubin, my professor for EDUC215.

Previous research on stereotyping has shown that men are typically seen as more agentic (ie. competent, leader-like, assertive) and dominant (ie. aggressive, controlling, intimidating) than women and women are seen as more communal (ie. warm, helpful, supportive) than men. Very little research has been done assessing how gender stereotypes are affected by race. Only one study has examined the effects of ethnicity on stereotypes about men. It found that Asian men are thought to lack dominance and that they should be less dominant than white men. In our research, we explored AmericanÕs beliefs about how agentic, dominant and communal men of different ethnic groups (men of East Asian, Latino, African, European descent) are perceived to be as well as how they ought to be. We found that these stereotypes what men are like and should be like do differ based on their ethnic background.

The Wellesley College MRI Lab has focused on three projects this year: 1) We are synthesizing silica-coated nanoparticles for targeted delivery of therapy to pancreatic tumors. The particles can be non-invasively visualized using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 2) We use MRI, MR spectroscopy, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to examine the GCPII/AAV genetic and epigenetic mouse model of schizophrenia and evaluate whether the mice exhibit neurological and behavioral changes that mimic the disorder in schizophrenic patients. 3) Using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI, we study vocal learning and song development in the zebra finch.

The productions of the Ballet Russes dominated the musical and artistic avant-garde of early twentieth century Paris. Their ascent into stardom was realized through the hard work of talented composers, artists, and choreographers, their founder and impresario Sergei Diaghilev, and their powerful, connected, and intelligent patrons. Recent scholarship has often overlooked the influence and importance of patronesses like the Comtesse Greffulhe, the Princesse de Polignac, Misia Sert, and Coco Chanel and their contributions to the aesthetics of the Ballets Russes. My senior thesis explores the different effects of these four patronesses on the productions of the Ballets Russes. I will discuss the overall role of each woman within the Ballets Russes circle, and how their contributions affected the musical, artistic, and financial aspects of the ballet productions.

Manduca sexta, or the Tobacco Hornworm, goes through five molts before becoming a pupa. After the fifth larval molt, the caterpillar goes from the larval stage (caterpillar) to the pupal stage (pupae). This change is marked by a drop in Juvenile Hormone (JH) in the hemolymph, the caterpillarÕs circulatory liquid analogous to mammalian blood. JH levels drop in the hemolymph once the caterpillar reaches a particular body size. Starvation before reaching the critical weight delays pupation. If JH is removed from the animal, the larva can pupate at a much smaller body size as long as it feeds a diet containing amino acids. Amino acids activate the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway, so we hypothesized that TOR signaling might regulate the timing of pupation in larvae that have no JH. Feeding the caterpillars a rapamycin enriched diet inhibits TOR signaling. In black mutant Manduca sexta that naturally have less JH, feeding rapamycin produced significantly larger animals. In contrast the wild type animals rapamycin depressed the growth rate, but does not change the peak weight. The prothoracic gland growth was also disproportionately slower relative to the growth of the whole body. Further analysis of the prothoracic gland size compared to growth rate will shed light on how closely the prothoracic gland size is tied to the onset of metamorphosis.

My research is about the way in which Jamaican immigrants to the United States acquire features of Standard American English. Accents and dialect change are a common phenomenon, but have not been widely researched. Jamaican Creole, or Patwa, presents a unique case for this type of linguistic study because of its close relationship with English and the embedded history of its formation. This research study consists of interviews with Jamaican immigrants, with a wide range of ages, socioeconomic statuses, and length of U.S. residency. Within the interviews, target words and sounds are elicited from the participants and background information is collected in the follow-up questionnaire. This study predicts that the speakers will demonstrate some acquisition of Standard American English accent features, and that this acquisition process will vary with SES and length of residency. Additionally, this study will examine what features are more easily acquired in the process of dialect change.

Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) is a rodent model of human autoimmune uveitis, a condition often caused by autoimmune disorders that results in the inflammation of the uvea. EAU provides a preclinical model for the assessment and therapeutic treatment of autoimmune retinal inflammation and posterior uveitis. EAU was induced in C57BL/6 mice by injection of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP. 1-20) combined with complete FreundÕs adjuvant (CFA). High-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was used as a clinical method for fundus imaging and evaluating EAU outcomes in mice overtime. Mice were sacrificed at various time points, and eyes were frozen, cross-sectioned, and stained with hematoxilin and eosin (H&E) in order to match the histology with the representative OCT image. At peak stages of EAU, images show retinal folds, photoreceptor damage, and retinal detachment.  SD-OCT allows the user to define the representative morphologic details of EAU in individuals during disease progression. Additionally, these findings are closely correlated with underlying histologic changes at each time-point.

Defensive pessimism is a cognitive strategy in which individuals set low expectations for their performance and mentally simulate, in specific terms, what might go wrong prior to an anxiety-arousing situation. The objective of my thesis study is to determine if defensive pessimists show the same cognitive benefits that people in a negative mood have demonstrated in previous research. Findings in the literature indicate that people with negative affect may perform better than people in a positive mood on certain types of cognitive tasks, including memory and stereotype susceptibility. I hypothesize that defensive pessimists may perform better than controls on an image based memory task because they are chronically in a more negative mood than optimists. Consequently, they might be more resistant to the misinformation effect and may be more detail-oriented. I would like to share my experience and findings with the community by presenting my objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.

My senior thesis focuses on the microprocessor industry.  A microprocessor contains the central processing unit and takes the role of the brain for a computer.  For the past decades, we have benefited greatly from its technological improvement.  To accurately measure the contribution of such technological improvement to the economic growth, we construct constant quality price index, which helps us understand the quality trend in the industry.  With such a price index, I also develop a theoretical profit maximization model for laptop microprocessor manufacturers like Intel.  The most critical business decision for microprocessor manufacturers is when to adopt the frontier technology, as there is a large fixed cost for incorporating the newest technology.  My model attempts to scrutinize the mechanism behind such decision, and therefore shed light on how we can provide the best incentives for manufacturers to adopt frontier technology.

My presentation will discuss my research on Latina Women's Health including a review of the literature, observations at a clinic serving Latinas, and interviews with providers to the Latina community.

From April to July 1994, between 800,000 and one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus perished in the Rwandan genocide, which was the most efficient mass killing since WWII. After the genocide, the Tutsi regime was intent on addressing impunity, but faced steep challenges in light of the scope of the violence. Given the overwhelming caseload facing the conventional courts, the state turned to gacaca, a system of community-based courts based on a traditional conflict resolution model of the same name. However, it made significant modifications to the traditional scheme, including making Rwandans' participation mandatory.This research examines these modifications to the traditional gacaca system and considers the implications of the state's approach for advancing national reconciliation. As scholars have observed, while gacaca in its traditional form advanced reconciliation, the features of the contemporary system created a vastly different setting, which laid the foundations for different results. My research explores some of these results in the context of the stateÕs organization and implementation of the gacaca system. Considering data gathered from my interviews with Rwandans, I will present an analysis of how Rwandans generally have perceived gacaca and its role in advancing national reconciliation.

I will discuss my thesis work in computable structure theory, a branch of mathematical logic.  My work involves investigating the complexity of index sets of a variety of computable groups.  The complexity of the index set provides insight into the complexity of the group. We use standard tools of computability to measure complexity.

Diatomic Sulfur, S2, is present in the atmospheres of Jupiter and its moon, Io. It is very difficult to obtain an S2 spectrum in the laboratory; when heated, elemental sulfur forms many different gaseous species including S2, S3, and S4. We use a two-temperature furnace and absorption cell to create conditions of high temperature and low pressure, which favor pure S2 formation. Using high resolution measurements from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland, we quantified oscillator strengths for atmospheric modeling purposes. This work is generously supported by the Jerome A. Schiff Fellowship.

This piece was composed following the events commonly referred to as the Arab Spring in late 2010 to early 2011. It is an ethnodrama comprised of the voices of students attending school abroad, away from their countries and their families, as they witness the tragedies and transformations of the places they call home. These voices come from Libya, Yemen, Bahrain, and Egypt, but may very well represent the voices of all those affected by such conflicts from all parts of the world.

The success of species introductions can be traced back to the interaction between the speciesÕ genome and the environment. The genetic richness involved in such success can either be imprinted in the genetic patterns at the source location, or gained in situ through demographic expansion and multiple introduction pulses. The weevil Galapaganus howdenae howdenae, introduced to the Gal‡pagos archipelago from the lowlands of mainland Ecuador and Perœ, is a prime example of an introduced species with an expanding geographic range. Through genotyping eight microsatellite loci, we aim to answer important questions, such as:
1) Are the genetic patterns observed in island populations a function of the introduction history of these localities and related to G. h. howdenaeÕs invasive potential, or are these species-specific patterns already present in source populations in Continental Ecuador?
2) What are the details of this introduction? What is/are the geographic origin/s of the island populations? How many introduction pulses have occurred? How differentiated are the continental source populations? When did these introductions occur?

In my senior thesis, developed under the supervision of the Art History Department and with the support of the French Department, I am examining the intersection of early modern art and medicine in ƒdouard VuillardÕs unsettling domestic interior scenes from the 1890s.  Although significant scholarship has been conducted on the nexus of literature and science at the turn of the century, an analysis of the relationship between early modern art and medicine is less developed. In my thesis, I am re-historicizing Edouard Vuillard within the medical discourse of fin-de-si�cle Paris. Specifically, I am examining how contemporary interests in illness, contagion, and morbidity may have shaped the thematic and aesthetic qualities of Vuillard's oeuvre during the 1890s.

The existence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products or PPCPs in the environment, particularly our water and groundwater, is a growing problem. Understanding where these substances go and how they move is a key factor on accessing their true impact on ecosystems and human health.To predict the fate and transport of PPCPs in soils, we need to estimate the soil distribution coefficient, Kd, in flow through systems. With our research this semester, we found that the best tracer fit and estimate of dispersivity was obtained with dry-packing, sodium chloride tracer, high background, and long injections. The recovery rate of sodium chloride was found to be 96.7% and the column dispersivity was 1.161 +/- 0.145 cm. Applying these results to the advection-dispersion equation will allow us to estimate the soil distribution coefficient, which will help us to accurately predict how common pharmaceuticalsÑacetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, and acetaminophenÑwill move in sand when they are released into the environment, and the risks that they will pose to humans and the ecosystem.

MOSFET transistors are a key component of virtually all modern electronic devices.  Today's most advanced MOSFET devices are encroaching on the quantum limit and therefore changing the way we think about these devices.  This project describes work to determine the theoretical foundation for MOSFET device behavior at low temperature, as a complement to work being carried out at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The simplicity of giving money to the poor for a specific and preapproved purpose appeals to many stakeholders involved in policymaking.  In education policy, CCTs have been proven effective in improving school attendance/enrollment and short-term learning, as well as lowering child labor supply; however, the effects have only been studied after a relatively short time period after the transfer. The ultimate goal of investment in education to get some return to that investment through an improvement in children's long-term well-being.  My thesis attempts to capture these longer-term effects (up to a decade later) for the recipients of the Honduran CCT program, PRAF. The results of this thesis will help to tell an important and untold story about the potential of CCTs as a long-term tool for poverty alleviation. The results will not only help answer questions about the effectiveness of PRAF in the context of Honduras, but will also begin to fill a substantial void in the literature on CCTs. Understanding the long-term benefits of CCTs will help researchers determine which interventions are most effective in alleviating poverty in both the short-term and long-term, and will help policymakers make more effective investment decisions.

Adverse selection is an undesired market outcome that occur when there is assymetric information between the buyers and sellers. For example, in the insurance market, people who know they have a higher risk of claiming than the average of the group are more likely to buy the insurance, hence raising the premium of the product for all other policyholders.

My thesis studies the problem of adverse selection in the late 18th century British life annuity market, in particular, the Irish tontine issued in 1773, 1775 and 1777. Identifying and measuring adverse selection in todayÕs insurance market has been proven difficult given the marketÕs complexity. I hope to shed light on a challenging modern empirical question from a new perspective - economic history.

The 2008 financial crisis sent shock waves throughout the world and spurred incredible reactions, one of which was China's $4 trillion RMB stimulus efforts. Narrowing down the incredible proportions of such a program, I am interested in studying the impact of such a stimulus by way of its Appliances to the Countryside program. In this targeted government, the Chinese government paid a 13-14% subsidy on certain brands and types of electric home appliances bought within a certain time frame exclusively for rural areas. My study will look at the impact of such a program and whether it actually affected the purchase of home electric appliances and perhaps whether other economic variables of interest were affected. In a still-continuing economic slowdown in China, there have been talks of a secret stimulus, and perhaps the Chinese government will again contemplate a subsidy program much like the scope of Appliances to the Countryside; therefore, it is interesting to see if the initial implementation has brought about the change hoped for.

By the end of the nineteenth century, the term intellectual was born in France and gradually became an established category referring to engaged thinkers who claimed to speak on behalf of the nation in the name of universal truths. Yet the escalating violence and use of torture on both sides during the Algerian War (1954-1962) for independence from French colonial rule pulled intellectuals farther and farther away from this previous archetype of the French intellectual as a defender of the values of liberty, equality, and fraternity so dear to the Republic. Not only did the war deeply divide the Intellectual Left, taking away its status as a group with a coherent anti-colonial message, but it also challenged each intellectualÕs notions of what it meant to be an intellectual. A closer look at the wartime writings and the evolution of the ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and Frantz Fanon highlights their ambivalence toward and nostalgia for the traditional role of the intellectual as the embodiment and voice of universal ideals.
On February 23 2005, the French parliament passed a law encouraging a more positive discourse on the effects of colonization and advocated the creation of elementary school curricula emphasizing its positive aspects. The law was controversial in France and in its former colonies, particularly in Algeria. In this presentation, I will provide information from my honors thesis on the teaching and legacy of colonization in France. I will include an overview of the French republican values that provided the arguments for colonization and which constitute the foundation of contemporary French culture and politics.

Ernest HemingwayÕs passion for bullfighting began in 1923 when he was 22 years old and continued until his death in 1961.   Throughout his career, he frequently returned to bullfighting in his life and work, generating numerous short stories, a novel and two nonfiction books on the subject.  My research explores HemingwayÕs attraction to bullfighting over time in order to gain a fuller perception of the author as a man and writer.  Hemingway began writing about the bullfight in his journalism, but soon he explored it in his fiction.  For him, especially in his short stories, the bullfight illuminates the tragedy of the bullÕs inevitable death.  But Hemingway also uses the bullfight to comment on the tragic elements of life, such as inescapable solitude and defeat.  In HemingwayÕs final nonfiction work, The Dangerous Summer (1985), he chronicles the rivalry of the matadors Antonio Ord—–ez and Luis Miguel Domingu’n during the summer of 1959.  The book was published posthumously and severely edited prior to printing, so the version that most people encounter does not represent the form in which Hemingway intended for it to be read.  I am examining the full, unedited manuscript of The Dangerous Summer with attention to how it contrasts with the published version.  When read in its entirety, The Dangerous Summer provides greater insights into HemingwayÕs views on courage, death and art at the end of his life.  My Ruhlman presentation will focus in particular on this important work.

What is altruism? It is a term most people have heard of, achieving the rare feat of academic jargon converted to popular vocabulary. But even so, there are a myriad of different interpretations of the word. It seems that most everyone has a sense of what it means, rather than a distinct, unifying definition. So how do we understand a word fully, a word that has come to mean so much for so many different disciplines? The answer, I believe, is to start at its conception. By attempting to locate the origin of the word altruism (not the notion(s) itself, for that has existed far longer) we can begin to track its movement through history, through intellectual texts and ideas, along the diverging fault lines of different disciplines, up until the present, where it has come to represent so many different things. How has altruism come to be, as we see and understand it now? The purpose of this thesis study is to find out.
This talk would concern my ongoing Honors Thesis in the English Department.  My work primarily concerns the sublime, as well as temporal and spatial settings and how these factors influence the sublimity elicited from divine figures in the poems, as well as the sublime experiences these personas undergo.  Other interesting areas include the grey area between an object as sublime, and as subject to sublimity itself, the temporal and spatial embodiments and restrictions placed on divine figures, and the separation of divinity and sublimity.  My goal is to explore these questions, and place myself in the current conversation about Keats' work, which my thesis will also address.

Conscription, or compulsory enlistment of military service, is a practice that has existed in diverse cultures since ancient times. Yet, due to the rising concern for individual freedom, conscription is now abolished in many states. Among the few that continue the practice is the Republic of Korea, in a protracted conflict with the Democratic PeopleÕs Republic of Korea, commonly known as South and North Korea respectively. South KoreaÕs geopolitical condition serves as the justification for its focus on the military, and consequently the justification for its tight control over the citizens, both those fulfilling the duty to national defense and those not considered as the duty bearers.

South Korean military and gender practices were recently made public in early 2013 with ÔReal Manly Man (chinjja sanai)Õ, a military experience reality TV show. As the self-explanatory title suggests, the program depends on the hegemonic gender regimes of manly men in the military. In this paper, I take a look into how the program and the practice of conscription construct militarized masculinity and femininity as the dominant values. In doing so, I consider not only how hegemonic gender regimes are maintained, but also how individuals outside the normative regimes are depicted. This paper aims to be a revealing study of the naturalized gender regimes of South Korean policy and culture.

A strong cooperative culture, where individuals contribute to productive social causes and refrain from selfishly overusing existing common resources, is central to the well-being of any society.  However, the degree of cooperation we observe varies dramatically across countries, as do the enforcement mechanisms set in place to sustain cooperative behaviors. My senior thesis investigates the impact of exposure to different institutions on social cooperation, and in particular, how the way in which a decision is framed interacts with institutional norms to result in different levels of cooperation between groups of people. I run a controlled laboratory experiment at the Harvard Decision Science Laboratory in which participants are randomly exposed to either a strong or weak institutional environment and then asked to play a one-shot public goods game (a social dilemma in which subjects choose between a socially optimal action and an action that maximizes their individual payoff at the expense of others). Using the data collected from these experimental sessions, I analyze the effects of both framing and institutions on social cooperation and how understanding the factors that contribute to the development of cultural norms and behavioral nudges could be used to promote cooperation.
This project will enhance our understanding of the Wellesley College-St. Stephen's parternship, Stronger Community, Stronger Schools. We will be studying the relevance of critical service learning to college students today and the impact of social change within Boston communities. We will explore what motivates students to join and continuing doing service. We also hope to find how service can inform one's understanding of social justice and their overall career aspirations.

Light is a taxing environmental challenge to plants. Although it is necessary for photosynthesis, excess light can inflict cellular damage, reduce photosynthetic ability, decrease growth, and strain fitness. Despite their immobility, plants manage to tolerate an impressive range of environmental light conditions through a variety of sophisticated acclimation responses. One mechanism plants utilize to acclimate to fluctuating light conditions is chloroplast movement. Chloroplast movement involves the physical rearrangement of chloroplasts within the cell to either avoid or maximize light absorption. In addition to chloroplast movement, plants rely on non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), also known as heat dissipation, to minimize light-induced damage through the conversion and subsequent dissipation of excess light into heat. In the Kšniger lab, we evaluate the relative importance of these fast acclimation responses toward the plantÕs fitness by studying various Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that exhibit genetic impairments related to chloroplast movement or NPQ. In addition, we investigate how different light conditions during growth affect the degree to which plants rely on these mechanisms. Our current investigations have shown chloroplast movement and NPQ are sensitive to environmental growth conditions during growth. In fact, plants grown under higher light exhibit chloroplast movement to a lesser degree than plants grown under lower light. However, plants grown under higher light exhibit higher NPQ abilities than plants grown under lower light. These findings suggest that a plantÕs chloroplast movement and NPQ mechanisms are flexible to environmental modulation.   Through these studies, we construct a better understanding of the plantÕs impressive physiological capabilities in tolerating its environmental stressors.
Cross bridging sociology and game theory, this project aims to investigate how the Chinese oversea college students in the U.S. manage to build different ideal self-images on the two major social networking sites (SNS) by developing strategies accordingly.

Facebook is the most commonly used global online social networking site where the users can upload pictures, post statuses, add other users as friends and play online interactive games. While the Chinese censorship banned Facebook together with Google and Youtube, this political move gave rise to local websites that copied the services of these successful foreign sites. Renren emerged as the Chinese Facebook in 2005, and quickly developed into Chinese biggest SNS by 2008. Now, Renren incorporates some unique features such as visitor calculation in the usersÕ personal pages, but the overall outlook still resembles that of its precedent, Facebook.
Prudently processing their pictures with Photoshop software, deliberately posting when most friends are online, and touching on the most recent and sensitive topics in news, people post to be seen, to be heard, and to be noticed. The Chinese oversea students, as well as millions of other SNS users, are trying to get attention from the potential viewers and optimize the resulting self-fulfillment from the attention, consciously and unconsciously. However, to fulfill their social needs among Chinese from their hometown and the newly-acquainted American fellows, the majority of the Chinese oversea students in the U.S. have Facebook and Renren accounts.

Though Renren is arbitrarily referred to as the Chinese Facebook, no matter how seemingly minute and deceptively inconsequential the differences between the two SNS may appear, when the trivial differences in web designs meet with the undercurrent of nation cultures, it triggers significantly different patterns of self-presentation among the same users. By observing the strategies in attracting attention on different platforms, it sheds light on the constructed selves: if we make slight changes in the platform where people express themselves, are we going to inspire the users to adapt new strategies to obtain their needs for attention? Do the channeled self-presentations lead to new constructed selves? Or, are we social chameleons, shedding off and putting on identities when needed?
Hypothesis 1:
The Chinese and American cultural backgrounds value different postings. The revered Confucian traditions in Chinese society extends its influence into the cyber society: a netizen who shows intellectual depth and opinionate personality usually attracts more followers and fans. However, the American society values more individualism and puts less emphasis on intelligence during interpersonal communications. Consequently, the Chinese oversea students tend to post long blogs touching on popular political, ideological and artistic issues on Renren; on Facebook, they update more personal and emotional short statuses. On either site, they post most desired and valued contents to maximize their self-fulfillment from other viewersÕ attention.
Hypothesis 2:
The web designs of Renren and Facebook channel different self-presentation strategies among the users. Though Renren and Facebook are identical on first sight, Renren has a trivial but crucial feature on its personal pages: other than the likess and comments, the users can check out each otherÕs total number of visitors, the recent 50 visitors, and the threads if someone else shares his/her posts. The popularity on Renren is significantly more visible than Facebook, and this design provokes more self-awareness when posting, since he/she can instantly check the potential viewersÕ reaction and the resulting popularity. On Renren, the user is able to develop a winning strategy of getting attention by the trials and fails of formers posts. The best players are Renren celebrities who have millions of visitors, befriend tens of thousands of followers, and are known for being known. These users serve as the interchanges of RenrenÕs clustered social network, amplifying the weak tie---namely, the power of friendÕs friends. The centralized networking structure in turn have an impact on the usersÕ behavioral pattern: the Chinese oversea students post political, ideological and artistic contents not only to win attention from their friends but also to impress the unknown audiences---the friendsÕ friends. On the other hand, Facebook promotes more spread-out and enclosed network where people donÕt usually reach out to strangers for attention. Consequently, the Chinese oversea students post more private, personal and emotional posts because their viewers are mostly their friends.
Hypothesis 3:
The Chinese oversea students present themselves differently to fulfill their varied social goals on Renren and Facebook. In the hierarchy of Chinese society, the oversea students are usually from the upper class, and this sense of economical priority is implicitly revealed by brandishing the related intellectual priority on Renren. Posting political, ideological academic opinions and essays on a platform of local Chinese users, the Chinese oversea students are demonstrating the underlying economic advantages behind their superior education. For them, the social goal on Renren, is to stand out.
On the other hand, the Chinese oversea students update their Facebook account to keep in contact with their American friends. By posting pictures with their American friends and sharing Chinese news, they project a self-image of open-minded Chinese who embrace liberty and democracy, a constructed-self expected to win popularity among the American players on the platform.  The social goal of using Facebook, for the Chinese oversea students, is to fit in.

This project samples the online self-presentation of 40 Chinese oversea college students who have both Renren and Facebook accounts, and have been in the U.S. for at least one year. The researcher collects and codes the literal and figurative postings on their Facebook and Renren personal websites across a three months time span. This research also includes interviews with 15 Chinese oversea students to collect first-hand information on the usersÕ satisfaction and attachment to the two sites.
SchumannÕs Phantasie Op. 17 in C Major was composed in 1836 with the primary intention of raising funds for a monument for Beethoven at Bonn. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that this piece, originally dedicated in BeethovenÕs honor, would draw inspiration from BeethovenÕs distinct compositional style. Although general conclusions have been made regarding SchumannÕs references to BeethovenÕs music in the Phantasie, in particular the quotation of the final song of BeethovenÕs song cycle An die Ferne Geliebte, closer observations of the musical parallels in terms of harmony, rhythm, key-relationships, and textural choices between SchumannÕs Phantasie and specific Beethoven works have yet to be demonstrated. I hope to explore the specific musical characteristics adopted from Beethoven by Schumann in his Phantasie by close comparison of the Phantasie with late Beethoven sonatas, including his Op. 109, 110, and 111. These analyses can aid in identifying the specific characteristics of BeethovenÕs music from which Schumann drew inspiration, as well as in understanding the ways in which he remodeled these elements creatively. In my presentation, I hope to outline the musical parallels found, and demonstrate a few ways in which the pianist can accentuate these parallels in performance of the Phantasie.

While teaching web development, as Wellesley College does in CS110, students need to learn certain tools - tools to write code and tools to move files from place to place. Currently, CS110 uses TextWrangler (a simple text editor that one could compare to Microsoft Word without the formatting) and Fetch (software for copying files between computers). While these tools help students to accomplish tasks in CS110, they have flaws. For example, users are not necessarily aware of specific changes that their partner has made to the code, and also risk overwriting their partnerÕs code when uploading files to a joint hosting account using Fetch. Other tools exist that donÕt have these flaws; however these tools are pitched for professional programmers. Furthermore, there is ample evidence that collaborative work can enhance the educational experience through both deep and meaningful learning allowing for a new level of understanding. CS110 takes advantage of the benefits of collaborative work, however, the current tools do not make it easy for the students.

The goal of CodeSync is to create a collaborative coding environment that is easy-to-use and engaging for beginners, suitable for use in medium-sized projects. My vision is that this environment will allow an individual or a team to create web-based coding projects that others can easily join and contribute to. Hopefully the engaging nature of this software will assist in keeping introductory computer science students excited about collaborating with each other to create amazing projects.

Each user will have her own account and with this account, the user will be able to create projects with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (languages used to develop websites) files, organized into folders. Users will be able to share projects with others and see what their team members type in real-time, much like Google Docs.

CodeSync will generate a project history log so that the project team can see which team members made which changes and when - these logs will each have an informal description, specified by the partner that made the change.
Through the introduction of CodeSync, a collaborative coding tool specifically geared toward beginning web development students, students will find collaborative coursework to be easier, more reliable, and more enjoyable.
Through examining different advertisements, I will draw conclusions about how the presence of an Asian person or object contributes to or otherwise complements the supposed appeal of different products. Additional comparisons and analysis will be made with texts on the history of Asian-Americans in popular culture, and with existing research on Asian presence in other visual media, especially film.
This project seeks to study not only the presence of Asian subjects in American advertisements, but also how it is utilized by the brands to send a social message. Little research has been done thus far on the interaction between the models, their appearances, their surroundings, and the audience viewing the advertisements, which would give a more comprehensive look at how American media, and popular culture more generally, currently view Asian people. In order to examine the 300+ advertisements I have compiled, I plan on coding for different components in them (e.g. product type, magazine it appeared in, gender of model) and then do a close reading of a few.

We are four interns from the Wellesley Centers for Women, each conducting individual research with a research scientist from WCW. Bernice Chan will present on the Media & Identity Project, a nationwide research study headed by Linda Charmaraman focused on how media use affects youth development, particularly for women of color. She will focus on Facebook as a tool for social change through qualitative interview data. Gabriella Andriulli is conducting research on middle school and high school aged children and teens on the topic of sexual harassment and assault. She is working on an article with Nan Stein, on an examination of the highly gendered aspects of sexual assault and how harassment/assaults are responded to in both the media in the legal system (if at all). Nikita will be speaking about how the PATH study and the CATCH-IT intervention program is preventing adolescents with depression and identifying adolescents that conventionally not be identified. She will also speak about how depression prevention is being increasingly prioritized with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Prioty Sarwar will present her research on adolescent development and sexual health in middle schools.

Humans have covered their faces with masks since early civilization, and throughout history, the mask has fulfilled many purposes---to hide, to protect, to sanctify, to frighten, to entertain... Anthropologically and culturally, masks are artifacts ripe with human narrative, and there is much to be learned. But as an art object itself it offers a creatively fertile space for exploration of symbolism and emotion. Through masks, individuals create extensions of themselves by constructing an external object or image. To me, this is fascinating; my painting series will explore the psychological, cultural, aesthetic, and spiritual underpinnings of masks.

A large and rapidly growing literature suggests that playing action video games may enhance a range of cognitive capacities (Powers et al, 2013).  This literature, however, has recently been criticized for methodological shortcomings, including inadequate blinding (e.g. Boot et al, 2012).  Two of the most highly cited studies reported successful training of mental rotation (MRT; Feng et al, 2007) and multiple object tracking (MOT; Green & Bavelier, 2006).  The only published attempt to replicate these findings found no training effect (Boot et al, 2012), yet this study did not document sufficient reliability in its MRT and MOT tests to detect a training effect.  We attempt here to replicate the original training effects with highly reliable MRT (alpha=0.82) and MOT (alpha=0.82) tests.  We used the same action video game as the prior studies (Medal of Honor, MOH, a first-person shooter), plus matched action (Wii Sports) and non-action (World of Goo, strategy game) control training games and a no-training control (NTC).  We carefully blinded participants to our hypotheses, and an extensive post-training questionnaire confirmed that this blinding succeeded.  Conditions did not differ significantly in their pre/post difference for either MOT (F(3,76)=0.93, p=0.43) or MRT (F(3,77)=1.96, p=.13), and no active training condition improved significantly more than the NTC on either measure.  Surprisingly, MOH improved numerically (though not significantly) less than all other conditions for both measures.  In sum, our carefully controlled, blinded study failed to replicate two key benefits reported for action video game training, despite highly reliable measures.  It is possible that the original reports of positive training effects for MRT and MOT were due to insufficient blinding or random chance.  Our results suggest that action video game playing has less influence on MRT and MOT than those prior results implied.

The frustrating experience of a good flicker change detection (FCD) task beautifully demonstrates a cognitive capacity more limited than we feel it should be.  Yet some individuals have a far greater capacity to notice such changes than others.  What is the source of these differences, and can cognitive training enhance our FCD ability?  A recent report of superior FCD performance in action video game players raises the possibility that playing such games may improve FCD ability (Clark, Fleck & Mitroff, 2011).  We conducted a randomized, controlled trial (n=81, 12 hours of training) to see if action video game play would enhance FCD ability.  Our game of interest was Medal of Honor (MOH), a first-person shooter used in many prior action video game training studies (e.g. Green & Bavelier, 2003).  Our two control games were World of Goo (WOG, a strategy game) and Wii Sports (WS, a sports game), and we included a no-training control condition (NTC).  To sensitively detect potential training-related improvements, we used a highly reliable FCD task (alpha=0.88). An extensive post-training questionnaire confirmed that participants were blind to our hypothesis.  While all conditions improved significantly (p<0.01), improvement did not differ significantly between conditions (F(3,75)=0.76, p=0.52).  Improvement in the MOH condition was numerically (though not significantly) lower than that of the WOG condition, suggesting no hint of a differential training effect for MOH.  Furthermore, no single training condition improved significantly more than the NTC condition, strong evidence against even a non-specific improvement for all video games.  In sum, action video game playing did not improve FCD ability in our study.  These results, in combination with our prior finding of high heritability of FCD ability (Wilmer et al, 2012), suggest that FCD may be relatively impervious to environmental factors.

Nitrogen-vacancy(NV) centers are atom-sized defects in diamond and have many potential applications, including storing bits of quantum information and acting as ultra-sensitive magnetic field sensors.  In order to manipulate the NV-centers and further investigage these properties, it is necessary to be able to detect single NV-centers.  This can be achieved with a confocal microscope.  When excited with green light, NV-centers will emit red-orange light, and the intensity of this fluorescence can be used to detect individual centers and create an image of the sample.  A confocal microscope, which can be constructed using a collection of relatively common optical and electronic parts, will be able to scan a sample of diamond nanocrystals containing NV-centers and collect images, enabling the further study of these centers.

This project explored the relationship between African American female comedians and the modern Black Freedom Struggle. Although women are often excluded in the popular memory of both the civil rights movement and black comics in the United States, the most financially successful, and arguably influential, black comedian of the 1960s was Jackie Moms Mabley. She appeared on stage as a bedraggled, grandmother figure that boldly asserted her sexual desires while slyly critiquing segregation, the United States government, and old men. She used her privileged position to directly contribute to the civil rights movement while indirectly uniting diverse populations around her common cultural capital. Through a study of Jackie Mabley and the communities she created around her comedy, I found justification to broaden our definition of political action and activism.

I am writing a series of poems that explores the way a childÕs voice can be mutilated or empowered or silenced by their heightened awareness of their identity within the world. People shape their own identity, and I want to capture moments when this identity is in flux. We will need these poems to see into the minds of these speakers, to grasp what internal struggles they face as a result of changes in perspective and self-awareness. As precarious as growing older, this project will probe the delicate or brash ways a person formulates their own identity. Though identity is a major topic and often incorporated into poetry, this project is different because the focus is more on conscious changes to the pre-adolescent self and the internal complexity of molding oneself.

I am collecting oral histories from Wellesley alumnae of African descent who attended the college in the 1950s.  My project was inspired by an assignment in Professor Brenna Greer's history course titled Modern Black Freedom Struggle.  I'm working on creating a whole collection of oral histories in the Archives to better document the post-WWII, pre-Ethos era of the 1950s.
This study examines the effects of a lawyerÕs age, gender, and goals on biases in jury decisions. Participants will listen to the legal arguments of a lawyer in a case involving libel. Participants will be assigned at random to hear a male or female attorney, who is either 30 or 50 years old. In addition, to manipulate the goal of the attorney, participants will be told that the attorney is either working for compensation and thus has an agentic goal  (focused on the self), or is working pro bono and thus has a communal goal (focused on the community). After listening to the legal arguments, participants will give their opinion concerning the case and will evaluate the attorneyÕs performance. I expect female attorneyÕs to be less influential than male attorneys overall, and especially in conditions where the attorney is older and the goal is agentic.

    Researchers have consistently noted that authenticity in relationships is essential to the development of well-being and promotes competence in interpersonal relationships (Harter, Marold, Whitesell, & Cobbs, 1996). Authenticity involves knowing the self and understanding oneÕs own thoughts, feelings, desires, needs, or beliefs (Harter, 2002). The construct of authenticity also applies to an individualÕs behaviors: authenticity implies that one will act in accordance with inner thoughts and emotions. Indeed, expressing the self in ways that are congruent with inner emotions and thoughts (i.e., saying how you really feel) is a fundamental component of authenticity. However, few studies to date have explored the factors that may help to account for why some adolescents, and not others, are at risk for problems with authenticity in relationships (with the exception of Theran (2009) and Harter et al., (1996a, 1997)). The objective of my study is to examine the roles that parental support and criticism and emotion regulation strategy play in shaping authenticity in relationships.

    Emotion regulation is one critical variable to explore as it is theoretically and empirically related to openness and honesty in intimate relationships. Emotion regulation is defined as the ability to monitor oneÕs emotional reactions and use oneÕs interpretation of feeling states to determine subsequent behavior. Effective emotion regulation skills predict good functioning in social relationships in both children and adolescents (Butler, Egloss, Wilhelm, Smith, Erickson, & Gross, 2003; English & John, 2012; Onchwari & Keengwe, 2011). Moreover, difficulties with emotion regulation increase the risk for poor functioning in relationships (English & John, 2012) and for internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression (Suveg & Zeman, 2003). The current study examines the role of emotion regulation in developing authenticity in relationships.

    In adolescence, individuals become increasingly aware that they are the object of other peopleÕs evaluations and the opinions of others gain significance in defining the self. Adolescents will try to hide their true selves if those behaviors and emotions do not coincide adequately with societal standards or the opinions of other important figures (i.e., peers and parents) (Harter, 2002). Level of support and acceptance therefore is a significant predictor of false-self behavior. An adolescent who perceives minimal support and encouragement from peers and parents will mold his or her behaviors in an attempt to gain support and approval (Deci & Ryan, 1995; Harter, Stocker, & Robinson, 1996). Accordingly, when adolescents perceive support from others, they are more likely to feel comfortable expressing their inner thoughts and emotions, thereby increasing authenticity.

    AdolescentsÕ emotion regulation processes and perceptions of parental feedback are expected to predict authenticity in relationships with parents. Further, level of parental support is hypothesized to moderate the relation between authenticity and emotion regulation.

Previous studies have uncovered links between remembering the past and imagining the future, suggesting shared mechanisms between memory and future thinking. Memory has been found to be influenced by mood: when people are happy, they remember more positive memories, whereas when people are sad, they remember more negative memories. We examined whether future thinking is also influenced by mood in a similar way: Do people imagine more positive or more negative future events depending on their mood? Previous research also suggests that events further in the future are seen more positively than events closer in time. Therefore, we also examined whether imagined future events were further away in time when participants were in a positive mood than when they were in a negative mood. Our findings may provide insight on how we imagine the future as a result of our emotional state of mind.

The Carrico-Moniz laboratory seeks to develop novel anticancer therapies through the synthesis and biological evaluation of organic compounds. Herein, we report on progress towards three ongoing research goals: the synthesis of two natural products and structurally related compounds with intrinsic cytotoxicity against ovarian and pancreatic cancer cell lines, and an organic molecular scaffold for the assembly of gold nanoparticles. Recently, our laboratory published a novel asymmetric method towards the synthesis of Spiroxin A, a natural product with promising activity against ovarian cancer. Current work in our laboratory is focused on testing the versatility of this method. In addition, we are investigating the bioactivity of simplified coumarin derivatives (inspired by the natural product Angelmarin) against pancreatic cancer cell lines. Specifically, we are investigating the role of isoprenyl position, chain length and chirality on the coumarin compoundsÕ cytotoxicity. Concurrent with biological studies, spectroscopic investigations to probe the underlying mechanisms of cytotoxicity are presently underway. Lastly, we are working towards the synthesis of a soluble, organic scaffold for the electrochemical assembly of gold nanoparticles that can be used for the delivery of therapeutic cancer agents.
I intend to examine the intersection between educational reform and the dominant ideology of domesticity in middle and working-class girlsÕ schooling in Victorian England (1837-1901), focusing on memoirs of the period.  First, I will briefly outline the process of locating these obscure and sometimes unpublished texts, as well as the conventions of Victorian and early Edwardian womenÕs memoirs.  Then I will move to a longer discussion of eight memoirs in particular that illustrate typical working-class or middle-class educations during this period of momentous educational reform.  I aim to show that working-class girls' education increasingly focused on domestic tasks, while that of middle-class girls reformed to encompass a more academically rigorous, masculine curriculum.  Despite this apparent divergence, however, both groups were still exposed to educations that promoted foremost the ideology of separate spheres and, more generally, female otherness.

I review the evolution of the science and practice of medicine in Iran (Persia) from the earlier days until the 20th century and the advent of modern medicine in the 19th/20th century.

With regards to any contemporary scholarship involving the representation of Black bodies in visual culture, the challenge is and has always been how a people, who were once seen as commodities, can re-signify their bodies as human. Within her art-making processes, conceptual artist Lorraine OÕGrady has remained loyal to this campaign to relieve people of color from depressed positions in the overall status quo. In one of her least known pieces, OÕGrady takes to the streets with the intent of both questioning legitimate forms of art, while elevating the black body to self-evident works of art. It is in this Art Is... performance piece of 1983, where OÕGrady responds directly to the inquiry of avant-gardeÕs relevance to Black people.

My original research on Lorraine O'Grady, a Wellesley alum from the class of '55, involved a series of personal interviews with the artist, as well as a visit to view her papers in the Wellesley College Archives. From my analysis, I found Mrs. O'Grady's piece as an indirect critique of a mainstream art institution that has never embraced lower classes of people into its realm of legitimacy and subjectivity, and greatness. What makes O'Grady's work distinct is her employment of specific aesthetic devices for the empowerment of her viewers. Her work contributes to an overall mission to encourage the visibility of marginalized populations as intelligible human beings under the art world's aesthetic gaze.

Les Nuits DÕŽtŽ is a collection of songs by Hector Berlioz with texts by ThŽophile Gautier. It is a rare jewel of the art song repertoire because of its genre: it is one of the first of few orchestral song cycles ever to be composed, and the only one from nineteenth century France that is well known today. Another fascinating aspect of the work is its unconventional origin: it was initially composed for voice and piano in 1840-1841, and not fully orchestrated until 1856. Despite its late appearance on the scene and its minimal performance hisory during Berlioz's lifetime, without question, the orchestral version has been the work to withstand the test of time: the piano version is less well known and far less admired today. It is BerliozÕs masterful orchestration that sent the initially admired piano version into obscurity and propelled the orchestral version into the limelight in the centuries following BerliozÕs death. My thesis explores Berlioz's reasons for orchestrating the work and analyzes his use of the orchestra to express Gautier's text. In this lecture performance, I will discuss and perform excerpts of Les Nuits DÕŽtŽ.

  Information regarding the population genetic structure of a species is useful in identifying distinct population segments that can be managed regionally apart from the global population. However, population genetic studies on pelagic sharks are limited. Previous studies on Isurus oxyrinchus have quantified both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA variation, but have yielded conflicting results regarding the presence of genetic population substructure within this species. Therefore, this experiment was conducted with the aim to assess the population genetic structure of I. oxyrinchus both globally and regionally, with particular emphasis on the structure within the North Atlantic Ocean. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCO1) gene was sequenced for shortfin mako sharks caught off the coast of North Carolina and compared to sequences mined from GenBank and BOLD databases from shortfin makos that were sampled from various geographic locations globally. Results indicate possible significant differentiation of North Atlantic and North Carolina to the Indian Ocean, South Africa, South Atlantic and Southwest Pacific.  Additionally, RAD (Restriction Site Associated DNA) sequencing was performed on the North Carolinian I. oxyrinchus samples, making this the first study to perform RAD sequencing on a shark species.
We looked at sediment samples from the Mid-Miocene Climatic Transition, which is a very dynamic period in time for the growth of the Antarctic ice sheet. We measured the clast count from a sediment core from the coast of East Antarctica to infer the growth and retreat of the Antarctic ice sheet at this time. By measuring the lithology and angularity of each clast, we can infer the transport method of each grain and origin.

A compilation and celebration of all of the work presented by Upstage, Wellesley College Theatre, and Wellesley Summer Theatre Company throughout the year.

Over the summer, I traveled with Sandra Bea, founder of the Muanjadi Organization, to the Muanjadi High School in Mbuji-Mayi, Democratic Republic of Congo. The Muanjadi Organization provides scholarships to promising high school students whose families can no longer afford to pay their $75-a-year tuition. The scholarships allow these women the chance to finish secondary school rather than facing arranged marriage between the ages of 13 and 15.

To celebrate the accomplishments of these incredible young women and Sandra's tireless work on their behalf, I'm compiling a documentary about the story of the Muanjadi Organization. The film seeks to honor the growth of Sandra's organization from its start as an inkling in the mind of a young Congolese emigrant to its status today, five years after its establishment, as a source of hope not only for Muanjadi's students, but for the entire Mbuji-Mayi community.

MagicBox is a modular toolkit for children to be able to have an immersive interaction with any cardboard box. The project was created for the course Tangible User Interfaces CS320 in the Computer Science department. We will demonstrate our project and show its functionality and design. It will be a demo of our project that requires audience participation. We want to discuss the theoretical implications behind a tangible user experience as well as talk about the iterative design phases that our project has gone through. In addition we want to discuss our experience at TEI, a conference for tangible user interfaces, where our project was accepted into the Student Design Competition.

In the summer of 2012, through the Shirley R. Sherr Student Research internship at the Wellesley Centers for Women, I worked with senior research scientist Dr. Wendy Wagner Robeson on a project looking at English Language Learners (ELLs) in rural Alabama. English Language Learners (ELLs) are students, both U.S.-born and foreign-born, who are learning English and do not understand enough to learn without support in mainstream classrooms. These students are faced with the dual load of learning English and keeping up in their academic classes, which are taught in their new language, putting them at risk of falling behind their peers. ELL students living in rural Alabama face additional challenges when it comes to access to support and resources. With steps being taken from the Alabama State Department of Education to further support ELLs, recent growth in the number of ELLs nationwide, and the continuing growth and diversity of AlabamaÕs population, there is hope for positive change and increased support for ELLs in rural Alabama.

Imagined interactions (IIs) are a form of intrapersonal communication in which individuals recreate prior social encounters in their minds as well as rehearse for anticipated encounters. For example, before a job interview, you might rehearse your presentation in your head. Individual differences in IIs have emerged in terms of variables such as frequency, variety, and specificity. One factor that might influence the kinds of IIs in which an individual engages is attachment style. Attachment styles describe the quality of peoplesÕ orientation towards relationships with others. My research question investigates whether attachment styles and the various facets of IIs are correlated. I hypothesize that a person who is preoccupied by their relationships with others might engage in a higher frequency of IIs than someone with a secure attachment style. On the other hand, attachment style and specificity of IIs are not expected to relate to one another. The results of this study will provide new insights into the ways in which imagination and mental processes link to real social relationships.

Nima is a suburb of the capital of Ghana, Accra, with a very high density exceeeding 250 persons per hectare. It is one of the oldest areas in Accra (in addition to Ussher Town, James Town and Accra New Town) mostly comprising  of immigrants from the three Northern Regionsof the country. In the Fall of 2013, while taking a class called Energy Systems in Urban Design at the Olin College of Engineering, I chose Nima as my urban site in need of having its challenges addressed as well as implemented the use of Homer Energy in finding out how local power generation will benefit the site.

JournalistsÕ accounts provide insight into conflicts and wars as they are occurring in real time. Journalists writing about foreign wars have the skills, experience, and contacts to produce an account but are often passing observers with limited understanding of the historical underpinnings of a conflict. My research project examines how a number of well-known war journalists reflect on their experiences, the ethical dimensions of their work, and the question of what makes for effective war journalism. Can journalismÑas a form of storytelling and history-makingÑmake a positive contribution to the way the conflicts it covers develop or to how a society comes to terms with a legacy of violence? What kind of action does war journalism represent?

The Conway lab is interested in the computational mechanisms of vision, specifically the encoding of color. We use three techniques in order to address this problem. We use fMRI in macaque monkeys to determine which areas of the brain are active in response to visual stimuli, electrophysiology to determine the properties of the individual neurons encoding these stimuli, and behavioral studies in monkeys and humans to match these observations with perception. Recently, our lab published a paper using fMRI to show the presence of color modules in IT cortex. My project has been to analyze additional fMRI data collected in IT cortex from the new macaques that our lab has obtained. Increasing the number of subjects in these analyses will allow us to further our investigation of these newly-discovered color modules.

Last summer I taught the Molecular Gastronomy: Chemistry of Cooking course for middle and high school students at the Explo School on the Wellesley College campus. Using the conceptual understanding of biology and chemistry attained in my coursework at Wellesley, I devised experiments for my students to do in an effort to bridge how biochemical concepts apply to the results cooked in a kitchen. In changing the variables of ingredient, temperature, or pH, we found drastically different textures resulted between food products. Although we didnÕt know how the food would ultimately turn out when we manipulated variables, we employed the scientific principles to formulate hypotheses and explain the final results. In my presentation I will review some of the experiments we did and results we found, which testify to what I myself learned about biochemical theory and practice in teaching the course.

Current therapies lack the specificity and efficacy to treat diseases posing significant limitations for patients. Our group aims to engineer two novel devices that serve as drug-delivery vehicles that have the potential to improve treatment options for late-stage pancreatic cancer and diseases that are currently attributed to medication non-adherence. One project, a collaborative effort, is creating a nano-vehicle composed of an iron-oxide core coated with a gold shell that provides targeted damageto cancer cells while being tracked in vivo with MRI. Functionalization of the gold shell relies upon the strength of an avidin-biotin conjugated system anchored to the nano-vehicle through polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers, which also add stability to the nanovehicle. Monoclonal antibody CHO 31.1 that targets the glycoprotein gpA33 expressed by many pancreatic tumors, and the therapeutic agent, a boron-10 enriched polymer which can be utilized for boron-neutron capture therapy are attached as biotinylated molecules. The second project is developing a Janus device that has unique capacity for extended gastrointestinal retention and release with an omniphobic side and a mucosal adhesive side. Respectively, this dual layer will enable repulsion of the food stream and allow attachment to the wall of the gastrointestinal tract.

Members of the 2014 Biological Chemistry class will present their thesis research projects, culminating their studies at Wellesley College. Coming from labs both on and off campus, these students will present their ongoing work, ranging from organic synthesis to cancer therapy research.

I will use my presentation at the Ruhlman conference as an opportunity to share with the Wellesley College community some of the research that I have been working on this year. As the Linda Coyne Lloyd Research Fellow at the Wellesley Centers for Women, I have been in the process of conducting research on sexual violence and harassment in school age children and teenagers in an American context. My advisor (senior researcher Nan Stein) and I are currently working on an article that we intend to have published on this topic. In our research and in our final article, we hope to illuminate the different gendered and sexed aspects of sexual harassment/violence, and apply such a framework to various case studies. We are interested in the ways in which institutions such as the schools themselves, the media (particularly newspapers, whether local or national), and the criminal justice system handle this oft ignored violence. It is our goal to highlight possible pathways to justice and critique existing approaches to the harassment and violence in U.S. schools.

The focus of the lab is to study the birth of new neurons in the adult brain of the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. We examine the intimate relationship between the hematopoietic system (innate immune system) and neurogenesis as well as possible modulation by serotonin via the cytokine, astakine.

Through the exploration of personal histories and discussion of the varied and often conflicting opinions of real people, documentary theater allows us to investigate, celebrate, and reflect on the society we live in.

Following WWII the fervently anti-communist atmosphere in the United States prompted the government, media and business community to promote a consumer culture centered on the idea of the ideal American family Ð most commonly portrayed as  a small, nuclear, middle class white family living in the suburbs. This family consisted of a white heterosexual couple with two to three children, often depicted as future capitalists, living in the suburbs with his and hers cars, a dog, and a white picket fence. This image, which dominated American film, television and advertising throughout the second half of the twentieth century, continues to maintain significant influence over American popular culture with only two of the three major national networks airing primetime programming focused on a family that does not fit this cultural ideal, and without more than one such primetime program on any network. This version of the American Dream and the family ideal at its core have become iconic representations of success and happiness to the extent that they continue to shape the values and objectives of young men and womenÑas well as public policyÑin the 21st century, despite very different historical circumstances.

In this project, I approach the question of how and why this particular family ideal continues to reign supreme in the public imagination by exploring the relationship between the performance and uses of construction of American familyhood and legal debates surrounding individualsÕ rights in terms of family planning. The rhetoric and tactics that particular groups used in legal battles over rights to privacy and birth control, in particular, suggest that the iconic American family not only propped up U.S. consumer culture, but also provided the ideological ground upon which the white-middle class pursued their rights to be a small nuclear family in manners that deprived other groups of the same privileges and ultimately shored up white patriarchy.

Since the 1950Õs, women have played an integral role in the demolition of laws restricting privacy and legislating the American family ideal, yet little has been written about the significance of the historical and cultural constructs of race, gender and family in these cases. While much has been written on the racialization of the American family ideal, my research combines a legal history of the right to privacy itself, with the cultural and social constructs that both promoted and helped destroy these laws by demonstrating a history and tradition of the right to privacy in personal relationships and reproductive decisions that helped establish the right to privacy as a fundamental right, which was therefore subject to strict scrutiny in the eyes of the Supreme Court. This heightened level of scrutiny which can only be applied in cases where a fundamental right is threatened was crucial to overturning these laws, and in order to demonstrate the history and tradition of the right to privacy in these decisions, women had to explore the tradition of the American family ideal, which was not historically legally restricted to intra-racial marriage or strictly unprotected sexual relations between man and wife because historically such legal constructs were not necessary to enforce this American family ideal. Through this demonstration many of the women involved in these landmark cases like Griswold and Roe had to perpetuate the social construct that the American family ideal was deeply engrained in history and tradition and that the freedom to choose that ideal, by marrying the person with whom you were engaged in a sexual relationship, or by choosing only to have two children so that you might live in the suburbs and perpetuate the Leave it to Beaver image was a fundamental right. My research seeks to demonstrate the intersection between the social and cultural histories of the American family ideal and the legal history of the right to privacy.

Alessandra and Em are working with Marion Just on an ongoing research project that analysis social media messages from 2012 US Senatorial Campaigns.  Looking at Twitter, Facebook and Youtube, we are looking to see if gender is an important or relevant variable in these messages.  The analysis includes measures of tone, topic, analysis of images and also user comments. Our prelimiary data shows a possible correlation between women candidates and negative tone and negative comments but we are looking forward to collecting further data on more races.

Metamorphosis and puberty are characterized by dramatic morphological and behavioral changes, and their regulation and evolution continues to be a puzzling scientific enigma. In insects, the timing of metamorphosis is regulated by the interaction between juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids. My research focuses on how the POU transcription factor Ventral vein lacking (Vvl) plays an important role in regulating the onset of metamorphosis. Silencing Vvl expression using RNAi interference (RNAi) resulted in the induction of precocious metamorphosis in Tribolium castaneum and a reduction in the expression of the JH-inducible gene kruppel homolog 1 (kr-h1). In addition to inducing precocious metamorphosis, molting was also inhibited in vvl RNAi animals. Since molting is regulated by ecdysteroids, the activity of ecdysteroid signaling pathway was examined in vvl knockdown animals. Thus, I looked at how vvl influences both JH and ecdysone signaling and biosynthesis, potentially acting as an integrator of both hormonal pathways to regulate the metamorphic onset.

About 700,000 cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), a type of skin cancer, are diagnosed annually in the U.S. Most of these cases are highly curable, but some tumors are high-risk and can recur (5% of cases), metastasize (4% of cases), or cause death (1.5% of cases). Although treatments for deadlier skin cancers, including melanoma, are highly standardized, there are no precise guidelines in place for treating high-risk CSCC. For my senior thesis project in biology, I evaluated ~130 patients diagnosed with high-risk CSCC tumors between 2000 and 2013 at Boston's Brigham and Women Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, with the goal of determining combinations and durations of treatments that were most likely to contribute to good treatment outcomes.

The western Acehnese coastline in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, receded on average 134 m due to subsidence and tsunami inundation in the course of the December 26, 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and tsunami. Here, we investigate the response of the coast since 2004 through field surveys, spatial imagery analysis, and numerical modeling. Three automatic level surveys were conducted in 2009, 2012, and 2013 over a beach ridge plain 15 km north of the city of Meulaboh and just south of the Woyla River. The surveys followed a transect from the coast up to 1.8 km inland. An 18.8 km long stretch of the same coastline was analyzed by digitizing the shoreline on satellite and aerial images taken between 2002 and 2011 and by computing the shoreline change rates using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) developed by the US Geological Survey. Following the initial erosion of an average 134 m during the December 26, 2004 event, the coast prograded at a rate of 15.8 m/yr with an average gain of 55 m from 2005 to 2006. This re-growth slowed to 6.8 m/yr from 2006 to 2009 and 1.2 m/yr from 2009 to 2011. Even though a wide new beach ridge has formed since 2004, the coastline never fully recovered to its pre-2004 position. In 2011 it was still an average of 52.7 m from its initial position in 2002. The three topographic surveys show that the top of the newly formed beach ridge stands out 80 cm higher than older beach ridges further inland, probably a response to the higher relative sea level induced by co-seismic subsidence in 2004. While satellite images indicate coastal progradation until April 2011, most recent topographic surveys conducted in 2012 and 2013 show a renewed retreat of the coastline of up to 40 m. In order to understand the most recent retreat and the complex interaction of vertical ground movement, sediment supply, and hydrodynamic parameters, we will apply the coastal model UNIBEST-TC developed by Deltares to the Aceh coastal system. Such data will provide insight into the mechanisms that lead to beach ridge formation and the modifications of coastal morphologies by earthquakes and tsunamis.

   At the beginning of every school year, new and returning Wellesley students sign up and audition for numerous organizations on campus. For singers, there are multiple options, including a cappella groups, the choir, Collegium Musicum, Chamber Singers, individual voice lessons. Unfortunately, there are many who love to sing in groups but may not yet have the musical ability to qualify for any of the existing groups inside and outside of the Music Department. During my experience in the choir, I have noticed that many of the people who are not invited to join the first time they audition eventually sign up for something completely different, and then do not sing while they are a student at Wellesley. To address this issue, I created a non-auditioned training choir open to all Wellesley students. This choir, the Wellesley Preparatory Chorus has three goals:

Provide a choir opportunity for those who would not otherwise have that opportunity, due to lacking musical ability or scheduling conflicts with other singing groups.
Teach basic vocal technique, sight-reading, and ear training to prepare members to sing with more advanced groups on campus, particularly the Wellesley College Choir.
Serve the Greater Boston community and foster the community within our group through performances at local nursing homes, hospitals, etc.

The following project is an analytical look at the essential parts of a choir and the singers' and the conductor's music educational and personal development through the Chorus. The project was conducted using the model of action research, and rehearsals were structured around the cyclical process of observation, reflection, and analysis. The poster will explore tecniques of ensemble instruction, findings about sucessful and unsucessful ways to solve problems, and major takeaways from this experience.
Since its founding, Wellesley College has taken a hands-on approach to science education that originally required large numbers of anatomical and other models, scientific instruments, lithographed charts, biological specimens and more. As time passed and technology advanced, most of these objects fell into disuse. A number of them were lost or discarded, but those that remain are important in understanding the history of science pedagogy at the College and science education overall. Our goal for this project was to inventory, catalog, and if necessary rehouse, important Science Center collections.

This project is far from completion. In the future we aim to finish cataloging the collection and assign proper storage for necessary items. We also hope to expand public knowledge of the collection by continuing a dialogue with the departments across campus and the Davis Museum. It is our hope that over time, with help from people across campus, these precious artifacts that tell Wellesley's rich history will be shared both locally and globally.

We will present a few scenes from our Fall show, Romeo and Juliet. Following the presentation of those scenes we will discuss our process a bit. We will finish with a scene from our Spring show, Julius Caesar.

Very broadly, my thesis explores the impact of socioeconomic status on education. I am specifically interested in understanding the experience of low-income students in high-income educational environments. Ethnographic interviews with recent graduates will help me to pinpoint the diverse barriers students face and the influence these challenges have on educational aspirations and success. I hope to identify the different social and academic norms students experience at home and at school and how a disjuncture between these may lead to conformity, rejection and/or strain. Participants will be asked to elaborate on a wide range of topics including academic expectations at school and at home, academic and extracurricular interests, educational aspirations and other related areas. High school is an integral part of the life course because choices made during this period impact studentsÕ future schooling, professions and opportunities. Therefore, it is vital to study the challenges that low-income students face to better understand the complexities of socioeconomic disadvantage and provide the tools necessary for all students to succeed in their future endeavors.

Our research analyzes marine sediment samples from a sediment core off the coast of East Antarctica. The sediment was deposited by glaciers about 13.9 million years ago during a period of intense glacial activity called the middle Miocene climate transition. Portions of the core from this time period contain pebbles deposited by icebergs. Our research has focused on extracting and analyzing biotite and hornblende minerals from these rocks using radioactive isotope dating of Argon. By determining the ages of the minerals found in these rocks and comparing them to pebbles found in other sediment cores during the same period around the continent, we can make inferences about glacial location and transport patterns around East Antarctica. Studying previous glacial dynamics in Antarctica and their global impact is especially important today, as conclusions from this type of research can be applied to predict the effect of a rapidly changing climate on glacial activity in Antarctica.

In an increasingly globalized world, contemporary Hollywood has capitalized on growing interest in Asia and Asian cultures by adapting several popular novels and television shows into big budget, feature-length films with all-star casts headed by some of the worldÕs most prominent and acclaimed directors. This thesis examines a body of cinematic feature films made in 1990 and later that a) prominently feature Asian actors, characters, settings, or themes and b) are adapted from a previous source such as a novel, television show, or video game, and analyzing how their translation from one medium into another reflects upon the role that Asian-Americans play in society today.
Recurring thematic issues in these films include:

The Racial Masquerade and the creation of racial politics
The treatment of Asian women in American cinema
Travel Narratives featuring white protagonists that take place in exotic eastern locales
How technological advancements have affected representation of women and minorities in cinematic culture

The ovarian steroid hormones, estradiol (E) and progesterone (P), are necessary to induce female sexual behavior. These behavioral effects of E and P are mediated through their steroid receptors, estrogen receptors (ER) and progestin receptors (PR) respectively. Once bound to hormone, these steroid receptors act in the brain to induce the expression of certain genes. E induces the expression of PR in the brain, thereby making the brain more sensitive to the effects of P. There are two major forms of PR that are made from the same gene, the full-length PR-B and the shorter PR-A. Interestingly, these two receptor isoforms have been found to function differently in the reproductive physiology and behavior of rodents. What is unknown is how E induces one form of PR over the other. Two steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs), SRC-1 and SRC-2, are known to facilitate the induction of PR by estradiol. We predict that the differential recruiting of SRC-1 and SRC-2 in the E induced expression of PR will influence whether PR-A or PR-B is expressed in a cell in the brain. To test this hypothesis we used triple label immunohistochemistry in mice that were genetically engineered to express either PR-A or PR-B. Furthermore, we investigated if SRC-1 and SRC-2 interact differently with the two PR forms. We used pull-down assays to look for interactions with SRC-1 and SRC-2 that are naturally found in the mouse brain. Our goal is to characterize the interactions with different PR isoforms and show their dependence on the activation of PR by binding of hormone. Our results will allow us to further understand the mechanism of steroid receptor mediated gene expression in the brain.

This research investigated the relationship between socio-emotional language and prosocial behavior among preschool children. We hypothesized that children who demonstrated prosocial behaviors, such as helping pick up dropped paper clips, would use more socio-emotional words in their responses to questions than children who did not help, while controlling for general language ability. Participants were 34 preschoolers, ages 3-5-years old (18 boys, 14 girls, Mage = 50.41 months, SD = 6.20 months). Prosocial behavior was measured in terms of the childÕs demonstration of helping behavior by picking up spilled paper clips; the children who did not pick up the paper clips were considered non-helpers. Results from univariate analysis of variance and t-tests showed no significant difference between the socio-emotional language use of helpers versus non-helpers. Although no significant results were found to support our hypothesis, we did find that over half of all the children demonstrated helping behavior. In this way prosocial behavior might still be related to language, however; the relationship is more complex and requires further study.


Public:
My research studies quotient groups of a non-abelian group, which is similar to studying the result of a corrupted or hacked network.  Essentially, we are trying to understand how redirecting certain aspects of a network changes the structure of said network. For example if you consider a hacker redirecting webpages (such as wellesley.edu)  to google.com; we are studying how this change affects the structure of the World Wide Web.This study helps us to understand the original network or group.  My research also enquires into how the relation between two  distinct groups or networks can help us to better understand each group individually.
Technical:
The modular group PSL(2, Z) is well known in mathematics to be the group of linear fractional transformation of the upper half of the complex plane. It is isomorphic to the quotient SL(2, Z)/K of the special linear group by its center K = {-I,I}. It acts on the hyperbolic plane as a discrete subgroup of PSL(2, R). Our work concerns the identification of quotients of PSL(2, Z) by the normal subgroups N(g) generated by a single element g. We will demonstrate great variation in the quotient types depending on the parity of the length of generating word, and apply these differences to an understanding of the Cayley diagrams of these quotient groups.
The ubiquity of online social networks has led to an increased reliance on these platforms as real-time information channels. As more people get their news from social media, being able to examine the credibility of a rumor becomes increasingly important. We investigate information credibility and trustworthiness on Twitter, a popular social network that allows its users to tweet statuses to their followers in 140 characters or less. Our objective during Summer 2013 was to develop a web-based automated workflow to evaluate the credibility of a piece of unsupported information by examining its origins, as well as the independence of the users who propagate it.

This talk would be an extension of my final paper for CAMS/WGST 249 regarding racial and cultural appropriation in the entertainment industry.  The paper focuses specifically on Katy PerryÕs performance at this yearÕs American Music Awards with a Japanese and Geisha inspired number as well as her other appropriations this year of Asian culture.  For my Ruhlman talk I would expand on this to discuss other white female vocalists who have also been guilty of appropriating other cultures and while there is some form of outcry each time, no one in the industry seems to be taking it to heart, calling people too sensitive and saying that no harm is meant.  2013 alone yielded a disproportionate number of incidents and I will use these examples to show that these are not isolated cases, but that there is a bigger issue in the industry that needs to be addressed.  Incidents I will discuss in addition to Katy Perry include Lady Gaga and Burqa Swag, Miley Cyrus twerking and her use of Black women as accessories, and Selena Gomez (who is Latina, but is often read as white) who put on a Bindi and performed a Bollywood-like dance at an awards show.  Even Lily Allen who is seen as an outspoken artist in the music industry missed the mark in her Hard Out Here music video when she hypersexualized her Black back-up dancers in a way that was not done to her white dancers.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading known cause of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is the most common form of inherited mental retardation. Fragile X syndrome is a single gene disorder that is caused by the loss of an mRNA-binding protein (FMRP) that is a known repressor of local mRNA translation. Because there is a lack of regulation on the translational process, there is increased protein synthesis at synapses, which is thought to account for many behavioral phenotypes in Fragile X. The mGluR theory of Fragile X suggests that increased protein synthesis can be alleviated by inhibiting group 1-metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) positively coupled to translation, including mGluR5. We have designed a novel behavioral assay in Fmr1 KO mice to test whether indirect pharmacological down-regulation of mGluR5-mediated signaling is sufficient to correct this phenotype by measuring cognitive flexibility. We are studying the cognitive flexibility of these cross-mice in order to determine if the loss of FMRP can be corrected by targeting the mGluR5 pathway. We are particularly interested in extinction (of a learned behavior) because there are noted problems with cognitive flexibility in Fmr1 KO mice and we believe that extinction is a viable measure of cognitive flexibility.
From the experiments of the Conway Lab, my project analyzes additional fMRI data collected in IT cortex to map and understand its

My presentation would be based off of my thesis project, in which I discuss my definition of harnessed visibility in HollywoodÕs traditional narrative films. The project emphasizes the importance of creating artful perspective in cinema, outlining the necessary cinematographic elements in artful perspective and applying them to popular films spanning from the 40s to the present.
This Ruhlman presentation will be based on American Studies seminar (318) called Interning the Enemy Race: Japanese Americans in World War II. We studied and analyzed the rationale by the United States government for the incarceration of American citizens of Japanese ancestry, and Japanese nationals living in the United States. Our research topics varied from the Japan's rise as a colonial power, life in the internment camps, the role of 442nd Regimental Combat Team, and race and politics in post 9/11 America. We will each discuss our research project, which will give a coherent historical view of how the Japanese and Japanese Americans were treated by the US government during World War II.

I first encountered the phenomenon of price discrimination in China while eating with friends at a small Guangdong-style restaurant in Shanghai. While ordering, we, all American college students studying abroad, realized we were being charged higher prices than the locals seated around us. This and other encounters with price discrimination during my six months studying abroad in China sparked my interest in finding out the true cause and extent of this socioeconomic phenomenon in China.

I designed an experiment and implemented it at two of Shanghai's large clothing bazaars. I hypothesized that no matter the Chinese-speaking ability of a foreign customer, this customer would always be more likely to be charged a higher price for the same goods as a local would. In my experiment, my native Chinese roommate and I haggled separately for the same items, and noted discrepancies in the prices we each received. During some of the trials I pretended not to be able to speak any Chinese, and during others I used my Chinese-speaking ability to its fullest extent (500 level). Repeating this procedure many times provided 50 trials of data. The results were surprising. In the end, my appearance as a foreigner had far less impact on price discrimination than did my Chinese-speaking ability. Indeed, when I pretended that I could not speak any Chinese, I was far more likely to be charged a higher price than my roommate. However, when I could speak Chinese, I was very likely to be given, not only the same price, but often a better price than my roommate. In my conclusion, I explore a possible explanation for this unexpected result: I believe it can be best explained by the desire for guanxi (good relations), the most important aspect of familial and social relationships in Chinese culture. When Chinese shopkeepers encounter a foreign customer who can speak some Chinese, a foreigner who has thus clearly spent time, money, and effort toward understanding their language and culture, these shopkeepers will desire to create good relations, guanxi, with this person.

In the time that each of us spent analyzing various aspects of cancer epidemiology, we realized that the disease is indeed multi-faceted and is not simply a quantitative field of study. Behind every trend and statistic illustrating the prevalence or mortality of cancer in the world, there is a dynamic interplay between what this says about political struggles between a population and a government in terms of seeking healthcare, eliminating risk factors, silencing the stigma of cancer and even influencing the economy of a particular place. Every person has an account of living with cancer or knowing someone who has cancer. Social media is a powerful example of how a cancer narrative which is traditionally unspoken finds its way to become widely influential and reflects certain cultural differences across societies. In our panel presentation, we hope to present to you a sampling of the numbers we found, and the stories behind them.

Haptic feedback is an area of technology that utilizes the sense of touch, by providing tactile interaction. It has been integrated into gaming consoles and mobile devices, and has been researched for its potential in programs that range from medical training simulations to collaborative workspaces. 3D is another growing facet of technology that is reexamining the possibilities of the user experience. The zSpace platform is the first-generation of computing hardware that simulates realistic, holographic, 3D, stereoscopic vision. User interaction is mediated using a pen stylus for movement and selection with 3 buttons, and a motor for programmable vibration feedback. This research project aims to study how haptic feedback can enhance user interface and understanding of 3D virtual space using this 3D stereoscopic display. The phases of the project consist of gaining the technological proficiency necessary to understand and develop for the system, applying and studying the effect of haptic feedback on the HCI LabÕs zPuzzle application, and finally developing and analyzing an original project integrated with haptic interaction. Evaluation will include a comparative analysis of user ability in haptic vs. non-haptic versions of these programs, for problem-solving, spatial reasoning, and recognition of physics and materiality simulation in the virtual environment.

In my thesis, I explore how discourses of Jordanian national identity have developed and changed over time and how these discourses have been expressed in public spaces in the capital city of Amman. The establishment of Jordan as a nation-state, the emergence in the 1950s of a Pan-Jordanian identity, and the promotion of a tribalized national identity in the aftermath of the civil war in 1970 constitute a narrative of changing discourses. The Jordanian governmentÕs management of different public spaces such as mosques and monuments is part of a larger project to create a national identity. But there are discrepancies between the intentions of the government and the actual use of these spaces due to competing visions of the Jordanian nation. In addition to my research topic, I will discuss the processes of primary research, such as observations at public places and archival research in London funded by the History department Schwarz fellowship.

Focus on the use of violence by extra-governmental groups is frequently concentrated on outrage; while this may be an appropriate reaction, it causes scholars to neglect the question if its efficacy as a strategic and tactical tool.  The Kurdistan WorkersÕ Party (PKK) is one group that has used violence over the last three decades in the pursuit of ethno-nationalist goals.  My senior thesis uses historical narrative and statistical analysis to examine the ways in which they have utilized violent tactics and those factors that determine their strategy over the last three decades.  Specifically, my research question is as follows: how have the tactics and strategy used by the PKK changed since 1983 and are there correlations between these changes and events relating to Turkish politics, internal Kurdish politics, economics, or natural resources?

To understand the age of features on Mars, and thus better understand the history of the planet, we must understand at rate landforms are being modified and created. The study of Mars surface processes is often limited to observing landforms captured by orbiters and rovers. We use pictures of the Martian surface from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to better understand how the landscape is being modified. Particularly, we perform a statistical study of mass-wasting features on impact crater rims, and model aeolian and soil creep processes.

This project draws from a national sample of 4,953 people, roughly 3,000 of whom are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) people of color in order to examine LGBT people of colorÕs levels of sociopolitical involvement (SPI) in organizations for LGBT people, communities of color, and LGBT communities of color. Results predict that LGBT people of color have higher levels of SPI in LGBT communities of color than in communities for LGBT people and people of color individually. These findings have implications for local and national policy, organization strategies and priorities, and further political science research in the fields of political involvement and intersectional marginalization.

One in six hospital patients in America are treated at a Catholic hospital, and in the last three years at least 20 Catholic hospitals have merged with secular ones. Catholic-affiliated hospitals must abide by the United States Council of BishopsÕ Ethical and Religious Directives, and merged hospitals are frequently required to follow these directives. One of the core set of directives, having to do with the beginning of life, do not allow any Catholic-affiliated hospitals to offer a range of reproductive services, including abortion, contraception, and sterilization. As a result of mergers, formerly secular hospitals frequently have to adopt the directives. However, the directives are often applied in an ad hoc manner, and hospital administrators and doctors sometimes attempt to circumvent them in confusing and roundabout ways. Ultimately, Catholic-secular hospital mergers lead to a variety of legal challenges, most of which are successful on the basis of medical malpractice laws.

My first introduction to adaptive sports was last spring; I volunteered at The Dixie Games, a competition for athletes with physical disabilities. This experience made me curious about the history and perception of adaptive sports and the Paralympic Games.  I was particularly interested in the way in which stories about adaptive sports are told.  This past fall, I conducted an independent study about this topic.  I set out with a number of questions I hoped to answer, including: What is the relationship between the Olympics and Paralympics and how has it changed over time? How are adaptive sports portrayed in U.S. media? and Is there a way to tell a story about the Paralympics without focusing on inspiration and disability?

I conducted over a dozen interviews with current athletes, former athletes, and sports administrators at both the national and international levels.  In addition to writing several research papers and profile pieces, I also made a radio documentary about the Northeast Passage sled hockey team.  One of the main focal points of my study was media; I believe this will transition well to my next endeavor as I anticipate that I will intern with NBC Sports during the upcoming 2014 Sochi Paralympics.
In my Ruhlman presentation, I will tell my audience about some of the history, experiences, and stories that I heard during the course of my research.  I think that adaptive sports can be incredibly inspirational, however, I also hope to convey the message that inspiration is a complicated subject and one that is often exaggerated in stories about adaptive sports.
App Inventor is a visual environment in which programs for Android mobile devices are composed out of blocks resembling jigsaw puzzle pieces. Blocks languages like App Inventor lower barriers for novices by eliminating many common programming errors and by providing visual guidance for understanding program structures.There are now almost 960,000 people using App Inventor and over 2.2 million projects have been created.

My previous work on this project focused on the collection and analysis of data from users' projects to get a sense of the proficiency of App Inventor users and the complexity of the programs they build.
My current project focuses on the runtime errors generated by App Inventor programs. While App Inventor reduces the number of errors possible for the user to generate, it does not eliminate runtime errors entirely. The goal is to understand the errors and the people who write the programs that generate them and to develop an effective means of providing debugging support to the user.

Members of the Elmore lab will discuss their research on protein-lipid interactions and how it relates to novel protein design for the treatment and detection of bacterial infections and certain cancers, respectively. Authors will discuss the computational and experimental methods they use to address these growing health concerns and the progress they have made so far.

General description:
Understanding the brain is among the largest and greatest frontiers left to tackle. Despite numerous advances in the field and current technology we still have much to learn. Our research attempts to gain a better understanding of the neural origins and correlates of attention. Using a rat model, we recorded the electrical activity from groups of neurons (LFPs) found in the frontal and parietal cortices while the rats are performing an auditory detection task. By comparing trials where the rat has either behaved correctly or incorrectly we can begin to attribute certain neural characteristics to attentional states. Event related potentials were generated from the LFP data. ERPs generally have characteristic peaks at various latencies. The parietal ERP had a positive peak around 200 ms (P2) which had an amplitude of  ~50uV during hit trials, showing a trend toward being larger than the P2 peak during miss trials. This was due to more than just licking since the P2 amplitude was only ~20uV during false alarm trials, which also involve licking. Thus, the parietal P2 is a potential neural correlate for response production. Coherence analysis was also conducted to determine to what degree neural signals are in sync, which indicates the areas of the brain that are communicating or working with each other. Data collection is still underway, but our preliminary results suggest that greater coherence at low frequencies is associated with the act of licking and not necessarily responding correctly. Overall, these results help us to better understand attentional processing in the rat, as well as its correspondence to human attentional processing.
Technical:
In order to investigate the neural basis of response production and response inhibition, rats were trained to lick in response to target tones to receive a water reward, and to refrain from producing a motor response on distractor tones (an auditory Go/No-Go task). Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from the medio-dorsal frontal and posterior parietal cortices, and frontal-parietal coherence was calculated for each trial. The parietal P2 peak had an amplitude of ~50uV during hit trials, showing a trend toward being larger compared to the P2 peak during miss trials (~30uV). This was due to more than just the motor response since the parietal P2 amplitude was only ~20uV during false alarm trials, which also involve licking. No differences were found between ERPs during correction rejections and false alarms. This does not support previous human studies, which found the frontal N2 to be related to response inhibition (Pfefferbaum, Ford et al., 1985, Bruin and Wijers, 2002). High levels of delta (0.5-3 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) coherence between frontal and parietal were seen in both Go and No-Go trials. Coherence data collection is still underway, but our preliminary results suggest that greater coherence at low frequencies is associated with the act of licking and not necessarily correctly responding. Overall, these results help us to better understand attentional processing in the rat, as well as its correspondence to human attentional processing.

App Inventor is a visual programming environment used to create apps for Android mobile devices. App Inventor programs are composed of blocks resembling jigsaw puzzle pieces. Neither Classic App Inventor nor App Inventor 2 provides a way for users to copy and paste code from one project to another. This is one of the most commonly requested features from users. Over the summer and during this past semester, I worked to implement a backpack that is useful and intuitive for users.

Observations suggest that nearly 27% of the matter in the universe is non-luminescent and non-baryonic.  Most astroparticle physicists believe this dark matter to be Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).  While the presence of these WIMPS in the halo of our galaxy has only been inferred from their gravitational effects on ordinary matter, several dark matter detection experiments are underway.  One type of experimental dark matter detection focuses on directional detection.  The direction of incoming dark matter is modulated both with the Earth's rotation and its orbit around the sun.  In the laboratory, we can detect WIMPs through their interactions with a target gas.  As WIMPs enter a detector, a small number of them will scatter off of target nuclei, causing the nuclei to travel through the gas.  The goal of directional detection is to reconstruct the paths of target nuclei and determine the angle at which the WIMP entered the detector with respect to the reference frame of the galaxy.
T-0632 is a small molecule, inverse agonist of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R). Knowing that T-0632 requires many of the same amino acid residues to bind as does the natural agonist, GLP-1, research was done to synthesize a photolabile analogue of T-0632 in order to map the binding site of GLP-1R.
Reductive amination of N-phenyl substituted isatin, a key step in the synthesis of T-0632, was previously accomplished through catalytic hydrogenation of the oxime. However, this reduction method on halogenated isatins resulted in dehalogenation. Alternative conditions for this reductive amination have been investigated such as the use of imine as an intermediate and the reduction of isatin into hydroxyoxyindole for amination via Sn2 mechanism.

For my honors thesis, I am creating a textual programming language for MIT App Inventor. App Inventor is an online tool for programmers of all backgrounds to create mobile apps for android phones. One of the main goals of this programming environment is to make computer science and programming more accessible to those without any prior background experience in this field. I am extending this tool to have a textual programming language associated with the blocks programming language so that users have the option of using whichever language feels more comfortable as they learn more about computer science. Beyond just App Inventor, I am exploring the relationship between visual, blocks programming languages and traditional textual programming languages.
Modern historical studies tend to take the nation-state as the unquestioned unit of study. In this history seminar, Port Cities of the Indian Ocean in Historical Perspective, we destabilized this assumption in order to look at society from the point of view of the coast. Student research covered the history of cities situated on the littorals of the Red Sea, East Africa, the Persian Gulf, and South Asia. We learned about the various elements of unity that constitute the Indian Ocean as its own world and coherent object of study. One of the elements of unity we discussed was heterogeneity and the common element of movement and mixture in port city societies. This presentation will focus on the reality of spatial and demographic heterogeneity and its implications for life in these port cities. Presenter topics will include: networked and traveling cultures, diverse communities/cosmopolitanism, and trade relations in the Indian Ocean region.

Two categories of iconic gestures predominate in early development, namely handling and object gestures. Whereas handling gestures convey how an object is held, object gestures involve physically representing an object with the hand. Initially, because of a discrepancy in the literature, we wanted to see if asking children to talk or pretend with their hands had any effect on the types of gestures they produced. We tested 65 children, ages 3 to 5 years old, and found that regardless of condition, they produce more handling gestures as they grow older. These findings provide evidence for a developmental trend away from object gestures and towards handling gestures.However, since the language and pretend conditions had no significant effect on the types of gestures children used, we want to see if changing the wording in other parts of the instruction has an effect on childrenÕs gestures. Since we previously asked the children to show us actions (e.g brushing teeth) with their hands, we wonder if phrasing the action as a noun (e.g show me toothbrush) will elicit a different type of gesture.

Bangalore, a rapidly growing global city in Southern India, serves as a useful case study to examine the broader phenomenon of environmental injustices in cities worldwide. Today, 8.4 million people crowd the city, 20% of whom are slum-dwellers who lack access to safe and affordable housing, clean water, latrines, transportation networks and employment opportunities. BangaloreÕs urban development plan is neither equitable nor sustainable and it is leading to widespread environmental degradation and injustices. I am specifically interested in how conventional paradigms of the natural-built environment in an urban context establish environmental injustices in Bangalore. Using this framework to analyze the history of the cityÕs urban growth and current drivers of urban environmental degradation and inequality will provide a rich context for my study of Ejipura Slum, the most widely recognized and contentious site of environmental injustice in Bangalore. Studying urbanization and resulting environmental injustices in Bangalore can serve as a useful case study for other emerging economies and inform development decisions in cities worldwide.
It has been widely written that women in America still hold shockingly few leadership positions (11.9% of executive leadership positions in corporate AmericaÕs Fortune 500 companies according to Catalyst data, and 23% of college presidencies in the American Academy according to the American Council on Education) in comparison to their male counterparts, so why have the women who have attained top positions in corporate America and in the American Academy made it to the top, and what do their experiences tell us about what it takes to be a high powered woman in the 21st century? The honors thesis seeks to answer critical questions about women and leadership, analyzing the relationship between gender, social-psychological issues, and cultural background in determining what makes a leader.

A brief literature review will be used as context to ground the set of interviews conducted with powerful women leaders that drive my analysis. I plan to investigate a number of significant questions in order to go about determining how women in top leadership positions have Ôshattered the glass ceiling,Õ so this may become a formula that may be more easily replicated in the future. I hypothesize it is the experiences the women undergo which motivate decisions that catapult them towards positions of power (not personality characteristics). I seek to discover common historical, cultural, and gendered impacts of their Ôexperienced struggles.Õ
The honors thesis will seek to answer critical questions about women and leadership, analyzing the relationship between gender, social-psychological issues, and cultural background in determining what makes a leader. I plan to investigate a number of significant questions in order to go about determining how women in top leadership positions have Ôshattered the glass ceiling,Õ pertaining both to the structural and cultural systems American women live in, in addition to a set of questions addressing work-family balance. By interviewing women in top positions in academia and comparing them to women in top positions in business, I hope to compare the differing paths and expectations of women in these different sectors in order to asses which seems to be more welcoming to women rising in the ranks. The goal of the project is to determine from these interviews why women have such trouble rising to the top (or breaking the glass ceiling), and the differences in this process between women in the corporate sector and women in the academy.

Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have recently attracted interest for their potential to act as single quantum bits for quantum computers. When excited optically, NV centers will exhibit photoluminescence and emit a photon. Since an NV center can act as a single photon source, our goal is to devise a way to experimentally determine if a given sample contains a single NV center versus multiple centers. One method that has been used is the Hanbury Brown and Twiss autocorrelation set up. This semester, I wrote a MATLAB script that models the photon detection data we would obtain from experiments using this method in order to make predictions and recommendations for future experiments.

Around 2.7 billion people around the world rely on solid biomass fuel for cooking. Traditional biomass fuels include wood, wood charcoal, agricultural waste charcoal and dung. In regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, almost all of Asia, and much of Latin America, at least 50% of the population uses traditional solid fuels. In some countries, including Haiti, Nicaragua, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri-Lanka at least 90% of the population relies on biomass.

The usage of any of these solid fuels has associated health, environmental, and economic impacts with it. The research I did last summer with Prof. Amy Banzaert that I am working on as an independent study as well is primarily concerned with the environmental impacts of the usage of traditional biomass fuels. The majority of effort to address all of the associated concerns has focused on improving cookstoves. Investigation of alternative fuels is another area of investigation, but fuels commonly used in developed countries are not viable economically. A smaller body of work is focused on finding alternative biomass fuels that would improve health, environment and affordability over wood and wood charcoal.

A study by Prof. Amy Banzaert compares agricultural waste charcoal (AWC), prepared from the carbonization of sugarcane bagasse, a by-product of the harvesting of sugarcane, and wood charcoal (WC) based on their combustion emissions. However, they have not been compared in terms of their effect on the environment. During the summer I created a life cycle assessment (LCA) in order to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of WC and AWC on the environment. LCA is a cradle-to-grave method that considers the inputs and outputs for each of all four stages of a productÕs life Ð raw materials acquisition, manufacturing, use, and disposal Ð and evaluates the cumulative environmental impacts that result from them. The results of what I started during the summer aim to contribute to the general body of work that searches for solid biomass fuels alternative to WC that are less damaging in terms of health, that are less polluting, and that are affordable.

Did you know that 11%  of Massachusetts residents are at risk for not getting consistent access to ample safe and nutritious food? This problem of food insecurity has had many solutions suggested for it, including bolstering the local food supply through supporting small and urban farms. Serving Ourselves Farm (under Boston Department of Public Health) is one of these; located on an island in the Boston Harbor, this farm provides most of its 25K pounds of produce per year to homeless shelters, rehabilitation centers, and post-incarceration job training programs. The New England weather makes for a very short growing season already and when the farm loses 90% of its seedlings, like last spring, as a result of mold from an unregulated growing environment, their yield is further limited. The farm budget does not allow for the purchase of a $1000+ climate control system to solve this problem.

Our team's year-long mission, working with Olin College's Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship class and Serving Ourselves, is to develop an affordable climate control system that will allow small farms to monitor and adjust their growing environments using pre-purchased heaters, lights, and watering systems, thereby addressing the problems of control and price for our client. Come hear our challenges, triumphs, and discoveries as we conduct our first round of on-site real-conditions testing, and gain a new perspective on the role of engineering and technology in the fight for just and stable social change.

I want to create art works with logs, branches and other rustic materials from campus, in which expressing my strong feeling for nature to viewers. Based on Wellesley ArboretumÕs geographical and environmental characteristics, I will choose specific areas to put in these art works. The art works could range from art structures to outdoor furniture. With the addition of these art works, the areas could be transferred into several sections including gathering spots, safe spaces or meditation areas for Wellesley community.
Quizly is a teaching tool for App Inventor developed by Ralph Morelli (Trinity College). It is used to make quizzes that can be embedded into web pages. It works by comparing the teacher-provided solution to the studentÕs solution in one of (then) three ways: exact block-for-block match, expression evaluation, or function definition. Over the summer, the function definition category was extended, permitting the use of helper methods and global variables in teacher and student solutions. A fourth category, procedure definition, was added, permitting the testing of procedures modifying global variables.

The carillon is a beautiful, sonorous instrument that is a oft-heard but also unknown treasure on Wellesley's campus. The Wellesley Guild of Carillonneurs takes it upon themselves to play and share the magic of this instrument as much as possible. The Guild plays an important role in keeping the spirits of the Wellesley community buoyed, and as a student in an Ethnomusicology Field methods class this past fall semester, I had the opportunity to take an in-depth look at the Guild's culture.As a carillonneur myself, I already had an in as an observer. I realized the Guild has a much longer and integral role in the community than I originally realized, and there is a lot of potential for the community to gain more enjoyment from our beautiful singing tower.

Representing various composers and operas from Leonard Bernstein to Dido and Aneas, our Ruhlman would be a collection of performances of famous works from the past 3 centuries to exemplify the relevance of opera in modern times. Included with each performance would be a description of the scene taking place as well as the meaning of the piece and the opera it is taken from as a whole. Based off of an opera workshop class, MUS 240, offered in Fall 2013, we hope to present the audience with proof that opera was made and continues to be meant for consumption by the masses. Opera is not a dead form of music, and, in fact, remains relevant to modern society and can be interpretted in many different fashions. From looking at the libretto and hearing the pieces, themselves, to thinking about the composer's intentions at the time of composition and the historical relativity of the piece, we can see so much more into the personality of the characters on stage and also add our own insincts to develop the character one step further. Opera--Not so Dead After All.

What are the factors that contribute to childrenÕs prosocial behavior? One possibility is that children are motivated to help others in order to preserve their moral identity. In collaboration with Dr. Rebecca Saxe and Dr. Laura Schulz at MIT, I have investigated how moral outcome affects future prosocial behavior. In the study, children were asked to perform an action, after which either a good, bad, or neutral outcome was revealed. We analyzed how the goodness or badness of the event played a role in 1) explanation of the event, and 2) immediate sharing behavior. Preliminary results suggest that children who experienced a bad outcome were more likely to attribute the outcome to the experimenter and share more than kids who performed good or neutral actions. These findings suggest that children are motivated to redeem themselves through subsequent prosocial behavior.

I have interviewed 14 working mothers who come from a variety of education and career backgrounds. My questions cover career and homelife satisfaction as well as their experiences as women and mothers in the workforce. The topic of working women and how they experience a gendered work environment and the impact of gender expectations of their work and home life is well researched and analyzed. However, there is a need for a more robust understanding of how women perceive themselves as workers and mothers within gendered work environments and a gendered world in general.  In all of the research on the situation that working women are in, not enough attention is paid to what women want for themselves and their families. This need for a greater understanding also involves a need for clearer and more inclusive language pertaining to this issue, which will be explored in my thesis.

Having problems with commitment? So are proteins. Our lab tries tohelp proteins find their perfect match. Using computational techniques, the Radhakrishnan lab can study biological systems that cannot be studied experimentally. We focus on understanding the electrostatic determinants of protein binding, with the goal of more accurately and efficiently modeling protein systems. Overall, we hope that our work can provide insights into molecular binding ---- and help with the love/hate relationships between proteins.
In 2002, Wellesley installed a synthetic playing field manufactured by the company NextTurf. From an environmental health perspective, there is a concern that the water-soluble lead chromate pigments used to enhance the greenness of the grass fibers may leach into the surrounding environment. While prevous analysis of turf samples from the Wellesley field indeed suggests increasing levels of lead being detected in the rubber infill of the turf (coinciding with decreasing levels of lead in the turf blades the metals may be leaching from), it is uncertain whether or not these metals can mobilize enough to leach into adjacent bodies of water. In this analysis, samples of turf grass and rubber infill will be subjected to leaching experiments. Repeatedly, samples will be submerged in rainwater and dried, and the collected effluents will be analyzed to assess the mobility of metals contained in Wellesley's turf. The purpose of this experiment is to clarify the impact of weathering on the leaching potential of lead and and other metals as well as the long-term fate and transport of these elements.

This past summer I worked with Professor Franklyn Turbak on Blockly, a visual programming framework. Blockly, developed by Google's Neil Fraser, is a web-based, graphical programming editor. Users can drag blocks together to build an application. No typing required (Blockly website). It is also the framework used for the Blocks Editor in MIT's App Inventor 2.

During the summer, I worked to create different connector shapes for the jigsaw-puzzle-like blocks. By creating different connector shapes for the different kinds of blocks, users will have even more visual cues to help them code or learn to code.
Another project that I worked on is creating an entirely new block shape for MIT App Inventor 2. There were originally 2 types of block shapes: Value Input Shape and Statement Input Shape. A Value Input Shape allowed users to connect blocks on the left and right sides of the block and build blocks horizontally. A Statement Input Shape allowed users to connect blocks on the top and bottom edge and build blocks vertically as well as showing the scope of local variables. The problem arises when, in a function, a user would want to return a value rather than execute a statement. Because of the left/right edge connection of the Value Input Shape, there is a lot of wasted space and there is no visual way to see local variable scope. To solve this, I created an Indented Value Input Shape, which shows scope and saves space.

This semester, I've been working on adding zoom and scaling the Blocks Editor space in MIT App Inventor 2. Because of the large block shapes and the small space users have to work with in the Blocks Editor, a zoom and scaling function was very necessary. The basic functions of zooming in and out have been completed already and it already makes using the Blocks Editor easier.
For Ruhlman, I'd like to present the work I've done with Blockly and how I've extended Blockly to make App Inventor more user-friendly.

The Community of Fazenda Velha, was certified by Palmares Cultural Foundation as remnants of Quilombo communities on March 1, 2007. The Community of Fazenda Velha has kinship ties with members of the Remanso community located in the Municipality of Len�ois. These communities are connected by the river and members usually attend Festivals of the neighboring group, weddings, and baptisms conducted in the backwaters of the Remanso community.  My documentary shows a brief story about the residents of the community of the Fazenda Velha and Remanso and reveals the silent dialogue between these communities that contributes to children to grow understanding their origins and how to appropriate their cultural identity. My documentary ilustrates the dilema between the arrival of the progress on the Remanso community versus the hold on progress for the community of Fazenda Velha placed under pressure to leave their lands, since the Foundation of the Chapada Diamantina National Park in 1985.

The Whitney Museum of American Art, founded in 1931 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, was instrumental in defining American art during a tumultuous time in the United States' economic history. When it was founded, the Whitney stood out among other cultural institutions in the United States, being the first museum dedicated solely to American art, and significantly, focused on contemporary American artists. By studying the exhibitions, lectures, and publications of the Whitney Museum between 1931 and 1937, we will see how museum contributed to the canon of American art history.

Ammonia is the most abundant nitrogen-containing compound within both high-mass and low-mass protostellar regions, which are known to contain high molecular diversity; including many prebiotic species. It has been proposed that silicate and carbonaceous dust particles provide sites for the formation of ices of various simple compounds, including ammonia. These ices are then bombarded with high energy photons and cosmic radiation (Emax ~ 1020 eV). We propose that the low energy electrons that originate when high-energy radiation interacts with matter are the driving force behind the reactions occurring within these interstellar ices.
From temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments we have identified the formation of hydrazine (N2H4), diazene (N2H2), and molecular hydrogen (H2) after irradiation with 1000 eV electrons for five seconds at an incident current of 1.5 &mu;A. We have also identified hydrazine and diazene after 150eV electron irradiation consistently at high electron flux (10 &mu;A). Hydrogen has been identified at incident energies as low as 5 eV. This evidence can help us determine the mechanism by which ammonia dissociates by interacting with high and low-energy electrons.

Through these works, I explore the visual components of my senior thesis topic, Bangalore: Urban Development and Design for the Underclass, which I am pursuing in my Environmental Studies major. Here, I am considering the complex relationship between the natural environment and built infrastructure of Bangalore. I am specifically interested in how historic paradigms of urban development have established and protracted the presence of slums.

I will present the research and findings from my CHIN 350 Interdisciplinary Independent Study, which will compare the government-led language initiatives of both France and China, and how it relates to the development of nation-state nationalism. Both France and China have had similarly hands-on approaches to their languages that will be interesting to analyze under modern contexts. I will be working with my adviser from the Chinese department, Professor Tham, as well as consulting my adviser from the French department, Professor Gunther.

My thesis focuses on the use of the os impurum (impure mouth) in invective language in ancient Rome.  I'm focusing specifically on attacks made by the poet Catullus and the orator Cicero. My research primarily looks at the mouth becoming impure through oral sex.  More specifically, a man's mouth would be considered impure if he performs oral sex on a man or woman.  The implication that a man has performed oral sex on another man means that the man is the passive sexual partner and is not truly a Roman man.  The nature of the attacks varies between the two due to the different genres in which they wrote.  Catullus's poetry is notable for the use of violent, obscene language.  He either threatens to force his victim to perform oral sex on him to assert his masculinity over the victim or accuses them of performing oral sex in excess.  Cicero, on the other hand, cannot use the same obscene, explicit language in oration.  He instead could only imply the illicit actions or refer to them in a roundabout manner.  I hope to focus this on what the os impurum means for Roman masculinity and how pervasive the attack was given the widespread use in both oration and poetry.

One of the key innovations in insect evolution is complete metamorphosis. Insects that undergo complete metamorphosis typically undergo three morphologically distinct phases: the larval, the pupa, and the adult stages. Recent studies show that this transition is known to be mediated by a key hormone called juvenile hormone (JH). Yet, how the specific genetic and hormonal components regulate maintenance and regeneration of larval structures, and the transition from the larval to the adult morphology remain poorly understood. Using the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, we examined the role of the Hedgehog (Hh)ligand protein and it's receptor, Patched (Ptc).  The downregulation of Hh resulted in disrupted limb patterning during metamorphosis and inhibition of larval limb regeneration. In contrast, the absence of Ptc led to over-proliferation of cells and ectopic outgrowths in larval limbs. Thus, during larval phase, Hh signaling is actively suppressed by Ptc but becomes activated during metamorphosis, indicating a potential interaction between Hh signaling and JH. In addition, given that Sonic hedgehog is also necessary for vertebrate regeneration, our results suggest a possible conserved role for Hh signaling during regeneration across metazoans.
